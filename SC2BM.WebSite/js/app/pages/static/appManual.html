                            <h4>Build Player</h4>
                            <p>
                                Build Player is a tool which will play build order for you and tell you what you should do next while you playing Starcraft 2.
                                You can start play build order by clicking on big Play button on the bottom of the screen. If you click on this button again playing will be paused.
                                Stop button will stop play build order and set timepoint back into the beggining of the build.
                                You can tell Build Player to show/hide worker build items by clicking on corresponding icon in Action Bar.
                                By default Build Player will start to play build order from 12 second from the beggining of the build.
                                This is handy because you need to hire first worker right after the game, add your CommandCenter/Nexus/Hatchery into Control Group and maybe do some warming clicks.
                                Try to click near 12 second of the game on Play button so Build Player would be synced up with your current game.

                            <p>
                                Our Build Editor is unique tool which allow you to create build orders using very accurate Starcraft 2 economy model simulation.
                                We know that in the beggining of the game each player has 50 minerals in bank and 12 workers available (6 for WOL and HOTS).
                                Our Economy engine will calculate amount of resources your workers would gather each second. Each time you would like to add
                                new build item into the build, engine will calculate closest point in timeline when required resources will be available.
                                So your build orders would be already optimized for you.
                                Action Bar provide back and save buttons for you.
                                Below Action Bar you can see statistics panel. Here you can check on which second of the game you are right now, how much minerals/gas you have
                                and how many workers are harvesting minerals/gas for you, what is current and available supply limits are and how many energy casts you have available.
                                For zerg players there is also Larva count indicator available.
                                Below Statistics panel you can see build items already added into the build order. For each item you can see current/available supply limits,
                                build item icon, name, start time and end time. Start/End time indicators will be bold-white if build item is currently in progress.
                                In the bottom-right corner of build items list you can see red Undo button which allows you to delete last item from the build order.
                                On the bottom of the screen you can see 4 buttons which allow you to add Units/Structures/Upgrades and some special actions into the build.
                                When you click on any of this buttons Add build item screen will showed up where you can click on any available build item and this item will be added into the
                                closest posible point in timeline. If some of build items in Add item screen are disabled you can click on this item and you'll see which requirement has to be
                                satisfied to be able to add this item into the build.
                                When you done with editing build order click on "Save" button to save your build in Build Library.

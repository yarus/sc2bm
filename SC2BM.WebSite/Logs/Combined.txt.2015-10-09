VortiX uses a gasless opening and transitions into a strong Roach Zergling timing, aiming to punish greedier Roach play or swift Mutalisk play.

Scouting

n the early stages of the game, all scouting comes from Overlord vision, so be sure that you send your initial 2 Overlords towards your opponent?s natural expansion. You can use your Overlord to compare his Hatchery?s HP to yours, to determine what kind of opener he used. If his hatchery is stronger than yours, he has gone hatchery first. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is the same HP as yours, he has VERY LIKELY done the same build as you. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is weaker to yours, he has gone for a gas and pool before hatchery in some order, meaning his speed is quicker than yours. Banelings before speed in this scenario is often advised, and likely make the Baneling nest in the main to not lose your Baneling tech to mass Zerglings with speed. An alternative is to not use your Gas, and get extra Queens and 2-3 Spine Crawlers. The main theme here is to not get Speed first, as his WILL be quicker. You need to find an edge that isn?t using Zergling Speed.
When playing versus any very early aggression (<10 pool), use your Drones to defend until you have your own Zerglings, a Queen, and potentially a Spine Crawler. Consider canceling the Hatchery for more minerals. Also use your initial overlord to scout when your opponent is taking their natural Hatchery. Feel free to apply some light pressure with your first Zerglings against a Hatch first build, but do not let it mess up your macro.
Make sure you have 2 to 4 Zerglings out on the map at all times. Send your initial 2 Zerglings to your opponent?s base to spot what they have at the front, and if possible get into the main with 1 Ling to see whether your hatching Drones or Zerglings from their eggs. Use the scouting intel that these pokes give you to determine whether you should get Banelings and extra Zerglings to defend yourself or pressure your opponent, or whether you should continue droning.
If your scout Zerglings see Drones hatching, and no wall at the front, you can choose to make Drones OR Zerglings to pressure. If you scout Zerglings, and no wall at the front, you should make the same amount of Zerglings. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings escape, send them back in to scout in 20~ seconds. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings die, remake the scout. Consider another 2 Zerglings for just-in-case Banelings. If you scout a wall, the Zerg is likely playing passive and you are likely safe.
As soon as you are sure you are safe, transition into your choice of tech.

Transitions

However, because you have not yet committed upgrades to either Ranged or Melee, you can choose between transitioning into Roach Hydra or Ling Ultra.
If you do choose to go for Roaches, immediately research Roach Speed and take your third, while droning as heavily as you can without endangering yourself. You can transition to a similar midgame to that of Vortix?s 3 Base Speed Roach, albeit without the fast upgrades.
It is not recommended you go for a Mutalisk transition.

Tips

Aim to focus down Queens with transfuse energy first, and use Roaches to tank any Baneling hits. Emphasize surrounds with your Speedlings and tank Banelings with your Roaches.

Pros and Cons

This build excels and punishing either greedier Roach players, and players rushing for Mutalisks. If it fails, you are behind as with any timing attack. You do not have any tech, you have no upgrades, and you will almost certainly be behind in drones. Additionally, because you are opening gasless, your defense is likely to be much more difficult. You will have no Banelings or Zergling speed, so your defense will revolve entirely around Spine Crawlers, Queens, and building placement.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Queen,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Drone,RoachWarren,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Extractor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,SpawnCreepTumor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,SpawnCreepTumor,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,SpawnCreepTumor', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:17:58 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '2 Reactored Rax Reapers', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This mass Reaper build order gets 2 Reactored Barracks cranking out 4 Reapers at a time in order to overwhelm your opponent with purely mass Reaper.

Scouting

There is minimal SCV scouting with this build because you will open the same regardless of what your opponent is making. The majority of your scouting comes from your constant Reaper attacks.

Against anything but Banshees, constantly produce Reapers to overwhelm your opponent. Against Banshees, be sure to cancel your Reaper production and start producing 4 Marines at a time. If you have done significant economic damage, then getting an Engineering Bay for a Missile Turret is not a bad idea either.

Transitions

This build actually transitions pretty well into a decent midgame for being an all-in. However, you can only transition into Bio after opening with this build because it is hard to utilize your quick Reactors and two Barracks early on if you are trying to transition into Mech. When you feel like you cannot do any more damage with your Reapers, be sure to stop Reaper production and begin your Bio upgrades.

For a standard Bio follow-up, get your natural expansion, start Marine production, and get a 3rd Barracks with a Tech lab. This way you can start Stimpack, an Engineering Bay, Factory, and 3rd Refinery all at the same time just like as if you had opened with a normal 1rax FE into Medivacs.

For a fast upgrade transition, start your natural expansion, Marine production from the 2 Barracks, 2 Engineering Bays, and then +1/+1. As soon as you can, get one more Barracks with a Tech lab so that you can start researching Stimpack. Then, you can take your third Refinery and get a Factory to go into Reactored Medivacs and +2/+2.

For a follow-up timing attack, start your natural expansion, Marine production, and a Factory instantly.  Get a Tech lab on the Factory and start Siege Tank production in order to hit a very fast Marine/Tank push with your second Siege Tank. Behind this contain/attack, you can get your 3rd base, 3rd and 4th Refineries, double Engineering Bays, and 2 or 3 more Barracks (get Stimpack and Combat Shields).

Execution

As soon as your first Reapers pop, start being aggressive. Your number one goal is to deny your opponents Factory for as long as possible (Hellions or Widow Mines can be difficult to maneuver around), but in order to do this, you have to be in your opponents face with your Reapers as soon as they are built. Also, with your constant harass, be sure to dwindle your opponents Marine count without committing too hard and losing any Reapers.

Your Reaper count increases very quickly, and when you get around 6 to 8 Reapers, you can truly overwhelm most units your opponent can have.  Thus, focus on killing his army with your initial Reapersyou will be able to kill his SCVs once his army is dead.

In general, if your opponent sees what you are doing, you are in trouble.  Thus, it is suggested that at least one of your Barracks is build outside your base (even just at your natural will sometimes work fine). However, you can proxy both Barracks outside your main to make this build a little more all-in too. This also works for some mind games because if your opponent scouts you with a Refinery but no Barracks in your main, he will most likely try to defend proxy Marauders (a defense that is awful on most maps against mass Reaper).

Pros and Cons

This build is very aggressive and can catch many opponents off-guard.  With a hilarious amount of Reapers, you are usually able to overwhelm their army within the first 8 minutes. However, even if the all-in does fail, it can still transition into a 11-12 minute Bio+Stimpack/Medivac timing.

However, if you do not do much damage, you will be quite behind your opponent in tech (and possibly income). Also, this build can be easily scouted if an SCV sees both Reactors building before a single unit, so at least one of the Barracks must be proxied outside of your main.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Refinery,OrbitalCommand,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,DoubleReapers,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleReapers,SCV,DoubleReapers,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleReapers,DoubleReapers,CallMule,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:18:02 PM;

This build appears to be a standard Zerg opener to the untrained eye, but it actually can outright kill most unrefined Terran macro builds in the lower leagues.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. Do your best to stop your opponent from scouting how many Zerglings you are creating. The rest of your scouting will come from your Speedling timing attack. Check whether your opponent is going for a Bio, Mech, or 3CC play. You should at the least be able to force your opponent to lift off their natural unless they made a tight wall ? don?t commit your Speedlings into a meat grinder if your opponent has walled off successfully.

Transitions

As soon as you hit your attack, you need to be droning quite heavily to be able to stand any sort of chance going into the midgame. Only put Drones back in gas and re-begin teching up to Lair, Evolution Chambers, and Mutalisks once you are getting closer to 2 base Drone saturation.

Tips

- Be sure that you take map control with your initial Zerglings. Being able to deny your opponent vision of your building Zerglings will make this attack that much stronger.
- Do NOT attack into a Terran force behind a full wall-off. Force your opponent to abandon their natural and continue droning up.

Pros and Cons

This build looks like a standard ZvT build, but hits your opponent incredibly aggressively with a lot of early game Speedlings. This Speedling timing should either outright win the game or give you an effective economic advantage that will take you into the midgame. However, because you are cutting Drone production in order to support this swell of Zerglings, your economic situation will be much further behind than what you might be used to. If your opponent holds the attack without taking much damage at all, then it?s possible you will simply get rolled over by any sort of counterattack as you are attempting to make Drones.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Extractor,Drone,SpawningPool,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,StartIdle,StopIdleIn5Seconds,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Queen,MetabolicBoost,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:18:02 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '2 Rax Reaper FE to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with 2 Barracks to produce a lot of Reapers very quickly.  It is a great way to get complete map control with 4 Reapers, apply heavy pressure to an expanding opponent, and transition into standard Bio play.  This 2rax Reaper build also can instantly win against some Gas First or CC First builds.

Scouting

This build is a reasonably safe build against most things Terran can open with as long as you are smart with your initial four Reapers. Thus, SCV scouting early on is not required or even suggested. Use your Reapers to take map control and pick off Marines/scout the front. However, there may come a time when your opponent has a Bunker up and you can no longer poke the front. Then, while prioritizing keeping your Reapers alive over all else, jump into his base and pick off SCVs/continue to scout.

If you scout your opponent opening Banshee, then cease Reaper productioninstead, favor making Marines and getting an earlier Engineering Bay. If you scout a Widow Mine Drop, then be wary of your opponents Medivac, and hole up in your main base until you have enough units to stabilize. If you scout a Marine/Tank/Banshee all-in, then keep your 2nd Command Center in your main base and play defensive. If you scout a 1rax FE, then scout for the Bio or Mech follow-up, and apply pressure whenever possible.

Note: If you scout your opponent going Mech, then add a 2nd Tech lab instead of Reactor on your initial Barracks and build some marauders too.  You can still follow the same basic build order, but you will have a little less gas than normal, so you might need to get early gas geysers than what is written up above.

Transitions

This build commits too much into Infantry upgrades for you to transition into Mech. However, it transitions quite smoothly into Marine/Tank or pure Bio (vs Mech).

For a Marine/Tank transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory for Siege Tank production, take your third base, start your 4th-6th gas geysers, and start another Engineering Bay+Armory for more upgrades. With your midgame push, confirm what unit composition your opponent is going, and play aggressively/passively accordingly.

For a pure Bio transition (if your opponent is playing Mech), start another Engineering Bay and Armory to continue your upgrades as you take your 3rd Command Center and keep your opponent pinned back. Threaten boosted Medivac drops whenever possible, but do not over commit your army if your opponent has an adequate defense.

Pros and Cons

This build is a safe build that also opens aggressively. With this build, you can pick off Marines and SCV, while simultaneously getting a full scout of your opponents base and stressing their multitasking. This build also has a heavy Marine follow up, and can deal with Banshees or 1/1/1 all-ins rather well due to the Reactor/Tech lab first. This transitions into normal Bio play but gives you the advantage due to early harass and map control.

However, this build performs poorly against early Hellion openings. If you scout Reactored Hellions, cease Reaper production instantly and transition into faster Marine/Marauder production. Also, if your opponent holds the Reapers cost-effectively with a 1rax FE or CC First (either due to you mis-microing, or them having a solid defense), then you will be behind going into the midgame economically.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,Barracks,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Reaper,SCV,SCV,Reaper,Reaper,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Barracks,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,CallMule,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,Marine,CombatShield,SCV,Marine,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Refinery,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,Factory,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,EngineeringBay,StimPack,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SCV,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,CallMule,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marine,CallMule,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,LiftFactoryFromReactor,TechLabOnFactory,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:18:03 PM;

This 1rax FE build gives you a strong economy, while staying safe from early Protoss pressure. It then transitions into a strong 10 minute push with +1 attack, Stim, Combat Shields, Concussive shells, and 2 Medivacs.

Scouting

When you send your scouting SCVs, you want to look for gasses, nexus energy, and the units he is producing out of his gateway. If he only has 1 gas before his stalker pops, check to see whether your opponent gets his natural at around 5:15 (You can hide your SCV nearby and then run it in around 5:30) to check for an expansion later if need be. If he has 2 gas and you don?t scout an expansion by 6:00, then be wary of an all-in. The common responses to standard Protoss plays are:
- Nexus First: Bunker rush with 4 Barracks instead of getting your 2nd CC OR Stop making marines at 3, get your 3rd CC and go straight into double upgrades to get a leg up in the macro game.
- Double Gas, No Expansion by 6:00: Get 3 bunkers (and a missile turret if you haven?t ruled out DTs). Pull SCVs to repair and provide a meat shield as necessary.
- 1 Gate Expand: Play normal.

Tips

- To confirm that your opponent is not allining you, have an SCV (or scan) go to his natural just before the 6 minute mark. A 4gate will hit before this timing, but 1 bunker and repair should be able to hold a 4gate easily enough; all other scary allins hit much later and this scout will give you enough time to prepare an appropriate defense.
- Unless you are expecting an allin of some sort, do not make marauders until you?ve started your starport. The 50 gas from making 2 marauders at a time will slow down the push by over a minute.
- Also related to this, you can push your medivac timing earlier by getting your factory before your barracks addons. Because you?re not making marauders just yet anyway, the only difference between getting the addons before factory vs getting them after is that you cut a couple of marines and get a faster medivac timing. Both versions are totally valid.
- Once you have your first marauder out, take your own watchtower by scaring away or killing his stalker ? up until you get a marauder out, you have to stay behind your bunker for defense.
- When you attack with your first 2 medivacs, be sure to scan your opponent?s natural in order to determine how much stuff/how many sentries he has waiting for you. If your opponent has too many units, then double drop the main instead of attacking directly into the natural.  Do NOT engage in chokes against sentries.

Transitions

As you?re pushing out, you will need to place down your 3rd CC, 2nd engibay and armory, 2 more rax, and a ghost academy or 2nd starport to counter your opponent?s HTs or collosi. If you?re feeling safe, then place down the 3rd CC and engibay first. If you?re worried about not having enough units, get the 2 more rax earlier, as well as possibly your ghost academy or 2nd starport before 3rd. Transition into 3 base bio with ghosts/vikings when you have the money.

Pros and Cons

This is probably the most standard 1rax FE. Compared to the other variants, it gives you reasonably timed infrastructure, a very safe opening against most 1 base and early 2 base Protoss all-ins, and of course the exact same economy as the other 1rax FEs.  However, early on you have no map control at all because of how well early stalkers can deal with naked marines in the open field; you don?t get up your 3rd CC extremely fast; and you don?t get up your 5 barracks up as quickly as Bomber?s build.
Other TvP builds, besides the 1rax FE variants, should also be considered. This build gives you a lot smaller army and much later upgrades than MKP?s 2rax early on, in exchange for a much stronger economy and a solid timing attack with Medivacs at around the 10 minute mark.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '3gate Proxy Oracle All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This micro-intensive build rushes for a proxy Stargate, and then pumps out Oracles to do damage to your opponents mineral line while simultaneously crushing through your opponents front with a strong Gateway+Mothership Core army.

Attack your opponents main mineral line with 1st Oracle as soon as it finishes (@6:15ish), and push at front with Zealot/Stalker/Mothership Core.

Scouting

This build is an all-in that makes a lot of units, so is safe in general vs an aggressive opponent  the only scouting you need to do is spot where your opponent has spawned and whether or not they have taken gas. If you are performing this build vs a gasless Terran, you can be much more aggressive with your initial 3 units and oracle. Versus a gassing Terran, you must be wary of Widow Mines, so be sure not to clump up your units when pushing up ramps or going into your opponents mineral line with your Oracles.

Transitions

This build is an all-in, so note that there is no clear transition out of it.  Continue making oracles (up to 3 or 4) and warping in Stalkers so that you can break the front. Note that if your opponent does eventually hold and you end up losing your entire army, then you are most likely behind both economically and in tech. Only expand and continue producing Probes once/if you break the front and you are just making sure that you have enough economy to follow up with a win.

Pros and Cons

This build hits very early with a proxied Oracle, taking advantage of the weakness of early game Marines without upgrades. This build is so strong because it gives you enough units to pressure both your opponents front and their mineral line simultaneously. It also then gives you the infrastructure needed to warp-in enough Gateway units to eventually bust down your opponents front.

However, this build is a very micro intensive build  you must be target firing with your Oracle in the main, while not losing any of the units in the front, usually for at least 3 minutes. It is also weak vs Widow Mines if you have poor control. Lastly, note that this build is in fact an all-in, so doing some damage but losing your entire army does put you behind by quite a bit.

Tips

- Chronoboost your initial Stalker so that you deny scouting from your opponent as soon as possible.
- Do not get your initial Probe trapped in your opponents base or killed, for that will force you to send another Probe to build the proxy Pylon and lose more mining time.
- You have to target fire individual SCVs for the Pulsar Beam to be most effective.
- One Oracle can take down 4 Marines if it has enough energy for Pulsar Beam the entire time.
- You can use the Oracles Envision spell for mobile detection in case your opponent has opened Widow Mine or Banshee.
- Be wary of Widow Mines both in the front or in the main mineral line and stay alert of the 40 second cooldown they have between shots.
- Dont forget to use the Mothership Cores Time Warp ability to help vs SCVs/marines in the attack at the front.
- Once/if you break the front, be sure to build an expansion and resume Probe production just in case your opponent does eventually hold.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Zealot,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Stargate,Gateway,Gateway,Oracle,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Oracle,Chronoboost,Pylon,Zealot,Zealot,Zealot,Oracle,Chronoboost,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,WarpInStalker,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:18:05 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '8-8-8 Proxy Reaper', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This all-in gets the fastest possible Reaper with which to do damage against your opponent. It then follows up with another Barracks so that you can make enough Reapers to overwhelm your opponent and outright win the game before it has even begun.

Scouting

You will be doing this build no matter what, so there is no SCV scouting.  The rest of your scouting will come from your Reapers seeing what your opponent has. However, an interesting SCV timing to note: you will reach a very nice proxy location with your SCV on most 2 person maps if you send it out exactly as you get 50 minerals for the first time at 8 supply.

Transitions

There is no defined transition from this build; it is basically all-in after all.  However, if your opponent goes for very quick roaches then you might want to add-on Tech labs and get Marauders. Besides that, you should have enough Reapers to evenly trade with anything your opponent can make, as long as you can stutter step appropriately.

Tips

- Do NOT lose any of your first 3 Reapers. They are the most important part of this build  applying the early pressure, forcing Drones to be pulled, and most importantly stopping Queens/Roaches from being made. If you lose them, you will most likely lose the game.
- Do not stop for Hatcheries or buildings of any kind. Go straight for the Drones and force some to be pulled off the worker line. If your opponent has their full economy up they will simply outproduce you.
- The only micro you have to do is stutter step against Zerglings/Drones, and pull back the weakest Reaper against Queens.
- 4 Reapers will kill a Queen without you losing a single one of them as long as you pull the targeted Reaper back in time.
- In order to hit the exact build order supplies above, you will have to cut some SCVs for several seconds. I highly recommend watching the tutorial replays (and using the Take Command button with a friend to see how you match up to it) until you get a hang of the build.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,GoOutScv,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,SCV,SCV,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,Reaper,Barracks,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Reaper,SCV,Reaper', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:18:07 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '7 Roach Rush', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This classic 7 Roach Rush all-in is a great build for newer players to learn one base macro with. It hits a very quick timing that can crush through inexperienced or unsuspecting opponents.

Scouting

This build can be performed against any opener Terran has. The only scouting you need to do is send your initial 2 Overlords to your opponent?s base in order to spot both where your opponent is spawned and whether or not they have a Bunker or Marauders that you will have to break down or fight.

Transitions

This 7 Roach Rush build is a strong 1 base attack that opens with a lot of units and few Drones, so your follow-up will be very slow. That being said, you should start to float some minerals as you are reaching your opponent?s base, so start a natural Hatchery, build a lot more Drones, and get Metabolic Boost as soon as possible. Going for a Lair and getting a Banelings Nest in order to start a Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk composition is a strong way to deal with Terran in the midgame.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong 1 base attack that can crush your opponent early before they have their midgame even established. However, this build can be held off if your opponent scouts it and prepares with a repaired Bunker or Marauders if they have opened with a 1 base play of their own. It also is much less economical than any Hatchery First openers.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Queen,Zergling,RoachWarren,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:18:07 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '15 gas FE into Mine Drop to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reactored Rax FE gives you enough Marines to stay safe against early Protoss pressure, while still getting a fast expansion. Then it transitions into a fast Marine/Widow Mine drop to hit your opponent with some pressure of your own. Interestingly, this build can also transition into standard Bio play or macro Mech play.

Scouting

This build is largely safe against any early pressure that Protoss can apply because it gives you a Reactored Barracks to pump out Marines two at a time. Also, if you are feeling unsafe, you have the minerals after your reactor finishes to place down a Bunker at your natural. Also, if your opponent is doing a 1 base all-in, then instead of being aggressive with your Marines/Widow Mines, you can keep them in your main and defend your Bunker/main. By simply constantly producing Widow Mines, Marines, and Medivacs to keep replenishing your defenses, you can remain safe against most all-ins. However seeing the all-ins coming is crucial. Scouting your opponents natural expansion timing with an SCV is huge (if your opponent does not have an expansion started by around 5:30, expect an all-in). Besides seeing an all-in coming, the rest of your midgame scouting will come from seeing how your opponent defends the Widow Mine drop.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because it gets a good economy, but also enough Marines to defend early game Protoss pokes. Then, the Marine/Widow Mine drop gives you complete map control AND keeps your opponent in the dark as to what followup you are doing (Mech/Bio/3CC). Not to mention that if your opponent is not careful, this build can get Widow Mines in your opponents mineral lines and land some huge hits on Probes, essentially winning the game instantly.

However, this build is more vulnerable to later all-ins such as Void ray or Blink+Mothership core all-ins than more standard bio play (because you will not have stim yet), so be sure to position your Widow Mines defensively and add on more bunkers against a Protoss that you have scouted isnt expanding. Also, with poor Medivac control, you can very easily lose your Medivac and all the Widow Mines if you are not careful. Lastly, this build is not quite as economical as a 1rax FE build, but it still gets a pretty reasonably fast expand, so its not too far behind a 1rax FE build in terms of economy at all.

Tips

- Early game Stalker/Mothership Core pressure may be hard to deal with, but position your Marines effectively and hold on until you get out a Widow Mine in order to defend your base.
- Once you have pinned your opponent on an aggressive build (for instance, by scouting a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), do NOT move out; instead, posture your Widow Mines and Marines in an appropriately defensive position.
- Oracles flat out destroy marines, so if you are fighting an opponent going for Stargate, position your Widow Mines by the mineral line and even consider getting out one turret per base.
- When committing to an attack, boost in and drop one Widow Mine at your opponents main-to-natural ramp in order to trap his army on one half of his base. Once you have his ramp locked down, you will have several seconds of complete control of the half of his base where his army is not located. Use these seconds to kill workers and/or position a mine in a crucial location.
- Above all else, the strength of this build is non-stop harass/pressure.

This 1rax FE build gives you a strong economy, while staying safe from early Protoss pressure. It then transitions into a strong 10 minute push with +1 attack, Stim, Combat Shields, Concussive shells, and 2 Medivacs.

Scouting

When you send your scouting SCVs, you want to look for gasses, nexus energy, and the units he is producing out of his gateway. If he only has 1 gas before his stalker pops, check to see whether your opponent gets his natural at around 5:15 (You can hide your SCV nearby and then run it in around 5:30) to check for an expansion later if need be. If he has 2 gas and you don?t scout an expansion by 6:00, then be wary of an all-in. The common responses to standard Protoss plays are:
- Nexus First: Bunker rush with 4 Barracks instead of getting your 2nd CC OR Stop making marines at 3, get your 3rd CC and go straight into double upgrades to get a leg up in the macro game.
- Double Gas, No Expansion by 6:00: Get 3 bunkers (and a missile turret if you haven?t ruled out DTs). Pull SCVs to repair and provide a meat shield as necessary.
- 1 Gate Expand: Play normal.

Tips

- To confirm that your opponent is not allining you, have an SCV (or scan) go to his natural just before the 6 minute mark. A 4gate will hit before this timing, but 1 bunker and repair should be able to hold a 4gate easily enough; all other scary allins hit much later and this scout will give you enough time to prepare an appropriate defense.
- Unless you are expecting an allin of some sort, do not make marauders until you?ve started your starport. The 50 gas from making 2 marauders at a time will slow down the push by over a minute.
- Also related to this, you can push your medivac timing earlier by getting your factory before your barracks addons. Because you?re not making marauders just yet anyway, the only difference between getting the addons before factory vs getting them after is that you cut a couple of marines and get a faster medivac timing. Both versions are totally valid.
- Once you have your first marauder out, take your own watchtower by scaring away or killing his stalker ? up until you get a marauder out, you have to stay behind your bunker for defense.
- When you attack with your first 2 medivacs, be sure to scan your opponent?s natural in order to determine how much stuff/how many sentries he has waiting for you. If your opponent has too many units, then double drop the main instead of attacking directly into the natural.  Do NOT engage in chokes against sentries.

Transitions

As you?re pushing out, you will need to place down your 3rd CC, 2nd engibay and armory, 2 more rax, and a ghost academy or 2nd starport to counter your opponent?s HTs or collosi. If you?re feeling safe, then place down the 3rd CC and engibay first. If you?re worried about not having enough units, get the 2 more rax earlier, as well as possibly your ghost academy or 2nd starport before 3rd. Transition into 3 base bio with ghosts/vikings when you have the money.

Pros and Cons

This is probably the most standard 1rax FE. Compared to the other variants, it gives you reasonably timed infrastructure, a very safe opening against most 1 base and early 2 base Protoss all-ins, and of course the exact same economy as the other 1rax FEs.  However, early on you have no map control at all because of how well early stalkers can deal with naked marines in the open field; you don?t get up your 3rd CC extremely fast; and you don?t get up your 5 barracks up as quickly as Bomber?s build.
Other TvP builds, besides the 1rax FE variants, should also be considered.

This 1rax FE build gives you a strong economy, while staying safe from early Protoss pressure. It then transitions into a strong 10 minute push with +1 attack, Stim, Combat Shields, Concussive shells, and 2 Medivacs.

Scouting

When you send your scouting SCVs, you want to look for gasses, nexus energy, and the units he is producing out of his gateway. If he only has 1 gas before his stalker pops, check to see whether your opponent gets his natural at around 5:15 (You can hide your SCV nearby and then run it in around 5:30) to check for an expansion later if need be. If he has 2 gas and you don?t scout an expansion by 6:00, then be wary of an all-in. The common responses to standard Protoss plays are:
- Nexus First: Bunker rush with 4 Barracks instead of getting your 2nd CC OR Stop making marines at 3, get your 3rd CC and go straight into double upgrades to get a leg up in the macro game.
- Double Gas, No Expansion by 6:00: Get 3 bunkers (and a missile turret if you haven?t ruled out DTs). Pull SCVs to repair and provide a meat shield as necessary.
- 1 Gate Expand: Play normal.

Tips

- To confirm that your opponent is not allining you, have an SCV (or scan) go to his natural just before the 6 minute mark. A 4gate will hit before this timing, but 1 bunker and repair should be able to hold a 4gate easily enough; all other scary allins hit much later and this scout will give you enough time to prepare an appropriate defense.
- Unless you are expecting an allin of some sort, do not make marauders until you?ve started your starport. The 50 gas from making 2 marauders at a time will slow down the push by over a minute.
- Also related to this, you can push your medivac timing earlier by getting your factory before your barracks addons. Because you?re not making marauders just yet anyway, the only difference between getting the addons before factory vs getting them after is that you cut a couple of marines and get a faster medivac timing. Both versions are totally valid.
- Once you have your first marauder out, take your own watchtower by scaring away or killing his stalker ? up until you get a marauder out, you have to stay behind your bunker for defense.
- When you attack with your first 2 medivacs, be sure to scan your opponent?s natural in order to determine how much stuff/how many sentries he has waiting for you. If your opponent has too many units, then double drop the main instead of attacking directly into the natural.  Do NOT engage in chokes against sentries.

Transitions

As you?re pushing out, you will need to place down your 3rd CC, 2nd engibay and armory, 2 more rax, and a ghost academy or 2nd starport to counter your opponent?s HTs or collosi. If you?re feeling safe, then place down the 3rd CC and engibay first. If you?re worried about not having enough units, get the 2 more rax earlier, as well as possibly your ghost academy or 2nd starport before 3rd. Transition into 3 base bio with ghosts/vikings when you have the money.

Pros and Cons

This is probably the most standard 1rax FE. Compared to the other variants, it gives you reasonably timed infrastructure, a very safe opening against most 1 base and early 2 base Protoss all-ins, and of course the exact same economy as the other 1rax FEs.  However, early on you have no map control at all because of how well early stalkers can deal with naked marines in the open field; you don?t get up your 3rd CC extremely fast; and you don?t get up your 5 barracks up as quickly as Bomber?s build.
Other TvP builds, besides the 1rax FE variants, should also be considered. This build gives you a lot smaller army and much later upgrades than MKP?s 2rax early on, in exchange for a much stronger economy and a solid timing attack with Medivacs at around the 10 minute mark. Also, it gives you more scans and SCVs to pull to deal with early DTs and/or pressure.

VortiX uses a gasless opening and transitions into a strong Roach Zergling timing, aiming to punish greedier Roach play or swift Mutalisk play.

Scouting

n the early stages of the game, all scouting comes from Overlord vision, so be sure that you send your initial 2 Overlords towards your opponent?s natural expansion. You can use your Overlord to compare his Hatchery?s HP to yours, to determine what kind of opener he used. If his hatchery is stronger than yours, he has gone hatchery first. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is the same HP as yours, he has VERY LIKELY done the same build as you. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is weaker to yours, he has gone for a gas and pool before hatchery in some order, meaning his speed is quicker than yours. Banelings before speed in this scenario is often advised, and likely make the Baneling nest in the main to not lose your Baneling tech to mass Zerglings with speed. An alternative is to not use your Gas, and get extra Queens and 2-3 Spine Crawlers. The main theme here is to not get Speed first, as his WILL be quicker. You need to find an edge that isn?t using Zergling Speed.
When playing versus any very early aggression (<10 pool), use your Drones to defend until you have your own Zerglings, a Queen, and potentially a Spine Crawler. Consider canceling the Hatchery for more minerals. Also use your initial overlord to scout when your opponent is taking their natural Hatchery. Feel free to apply some light pressure with your first Zerglings against a Hatch first build, but do not let it mess up your macro.
Make sure you have 2 to 4 Zerglings out on the map at all times. Send your initial 2 Zerglings to your opponent?s base to spot what they have at the front, and if possible get into the main with 1 Ling to see whether your hatching Drones or Zerglings from their eggs. Use the scouting intel that these pokes give you to determine whether you should get Banelings and extra Zerglings to defend yourself or pressure your opponent, or whether you should continue droning.
If your scout Zerglings see Drones hatching, and no wall at the front, you can choose to make Drones OR Zerglings to pressure. If you scout Zerglings, and no wall at the front, you should make the same amount of Zerglings. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings escape, send them back in to scout in 20~ seconds. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings die, remake the scout. Consider another 2 Zerglings for just-in-case Banelings. If you scout a wall, the Zerg is likely playing passive and you are likely safe.
As soon as you are sure you are safe, transition into your choice of tech.

Transitions

However, because you have not yet committed upgrades to either Ranged or Melee, you can choose between transitioning into Roach Hydra or Ling Ultra.
If you do choose to go for Roaches, immediately research Roach Speed and take your third, while droning as heavily as you can without endangering yourself. You can transition to a similar midgame to that of Vortix?s 3 Base Speed Roach, albeit without the fast upgrades.
It is not recommended you go for a Mutalisk transition.

Tips

Aim to focus down Queens with transfuse energy first, and use Roaches to tank any Baneling hits. Emphasize surrounds with your Speedlings and tank Banelings with your Roaches.

Pros and Cons

This build excels and punishing either greedier Roach players, and players rushing for Mutalisks. If it fails, you are behind as with any timing attack. You do not have any tech, you have no upgrades, and you will almost certainly be behind in drones. Additionally, because you are opening gasless, your defense is likely to be much more difficult. You will have no Banelings or Zergling speed, so your defense will revolve entirely around Spine Crawlers, Queens, and building placement.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Queen,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Drone,RoachWarren,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Extractor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,SpawnCreepTumor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,SpawnCreepTumor,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,SpawnCreepTumor', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:30:14 AM;

Feel free to apply some light pressure with your first Zerglings against a Hatch first build, but do not let it mess up your macro.
Make sure you have 2 to 4 Zerglings out on the map at all times. Send your initial 2 Zerglings to your opponent?s base to spot what they have at the front, and if possible get into the main with 1 Ling to see whether your hatching Drones or Zerglings from their eggs. Use the scouting intel that these pokes give you to determine whether you should get Banelings and extra Zerglings to defend yourself or pressure your opponent, or whether you should continue droning.
If your scout Zerglings see Drones hatching, and no wall at the front, you can choose to make Drones OR Zerglings to pressure. If you scout Zerglings, and no wall at the front, you should make the same amount of Zerglings. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings escape, send them back in to scout in 20~ seconds. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings die, remake the scout. Consider another 2 Zerglings for just-in-case Banelings. If you scout a wall, the Zerg is likely playing passive and you are likely safe.
As soon as you are sure you are safe, transition into your choice of tech.

Transitions

However, because you have not yet committed upgrades to either Ranged or Melee, you can choose between transitioning into Roach Hydra or Ling Ultra.
If you do choose to go for Roaches, immediately research Roach Speed and take your third, while droning as heavily as you can without endangering yourself. You can transition to a similar midgame to that of Vortix?s 3 Base Speed Roach, albeit without the fast upgrades.
It is not recommended you go for a Mutalisk transition.

Tips

Aim to focus down Queens with transfuse energy first, and use Roaches to tank any Baneling hits. Emphasize surrounds with your Speedlings and tank Banelings with your Roaches.

Pros and Cons

This build excels and punishing either greedier Roach players, and players rushing for Mutalisks. If it fails, you are behind as with any timing attack. You do not have any tech, you have no upgrades, and you will almost certainly be behind in drones. Additionally, because you are opening gasless, your defense is likely to be much more difficult. You will have no Banelings or Zergling speed, so your defense will revolve entirely around Spine Crawlers, Queens, and building placement.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Queen,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Drone,RoachWarren,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Extractor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,SpawnCreepTumor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,SpawnCreepTumor,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,SpawnCreepTumor', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:32:14 AM;

This build appears to be a standard Zerg opener to the untrained eye, but it actually can outright kill most unrefined Terran macro builds in the lower leagues.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. Do your best to stop your opponent from scouting how many Zerglings you are creating. The rest of your scouting will come from your Speedling timing attack. Check whether your opponent is going for a Bio, Mech, or 3CC play. You should at the least be able to force your opponent to lift off their natural unless they made a tight wall ? don?t commit your Speedlings into a meat grinder if your opponent has walled off successfully.

Transitions

As soon as you hit your attack, you need to be droning quite heavily to be able to stand any sort of chance going into the midgame. Only put Drones back in gas and re-begin teching up to Lair, Evolution Chambers, and Mutalisks once you are getting closer to 2 base Drone saturation.

Tips

- Be sure that you take map control with your initial Zerglings. Being able to deny your opponent vision of your building Zerglings will make this attack that much stronger.
- Do NOT attack into a Terran force behind a full wall-off. Force your opponent to abandon their natural and continue droning up.

Pros and Cons

This build looks like a standard ZvT build, but hits your opponent incredibly aggressively with a lot of early game Speedlings. This Speedling timing should either outright win the game or give you an effective economic advantage that will take you into the midgame. However, because you are cutting Drone production in order to support this swell of Zerglings, your economic situation will be much further behind than what you might be used to. If your opponent holds the attack without taking much damage at all, then it?s possible you will simply get rolled over by any sort of counterattack as you are attempting to make Drones.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Extractor,Drone,SpawningPool,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,StartIdle,StopIdleIn5Seconds,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Queen,MetabolicBoost,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:32:48 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '2 Rax Reaper FE to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with 2 Barracks to produce a lot of Reapers very quickly.  It is a great way to get complete map control with 4 Reapers, apply heavy pressure to an expanding opponent, and transition into standard Bio play.  This 2rax Reaper build also can instantly win against some Gas First or CC First builds.

Scouting

This build is a reasonably safe build against most things Terran can open with as long as you are smart with your initial four Reapers. Thus, SCV scouting early on is not required or even suggested. Use your Reapers to take map control and pick off Marines/scout the front. However, there may come a time when your opponent has a Bunker up and you can no longer poke the front. Then, while prioritizing keeping your Reapers alive over all else, jump into his base and pick off SCVs/continue to scout.

If you scout your opponent opening Banshee, then cease Reaper productioninstead, favor making Marines and getting an earlier Engineering Bay. If you scout a Widow Mine Drop, then be wary of your opponents Medivac, and hole up in your main base until you have enough units to stabilize. If you scout a Marine/Tank/Banshee all-in, then keep your 2nd Command Center in your main base and play defensive. If you scout a 1rax FE, then scout for the Bio or Mech follow-up, and apply pressure whenever possible.

Note: If you scout your opponent going Mech, then add a 2nd Tech lab instead of Reactor on your initial Barracks and build some marauders too.  You can still follow the same basic build order, but you will have a little less gas than normal, so you might need to get early gas geysers than what is written up above.

Transitions

This build commits too much into Infantry upgrades for you to transition into Mech. However, it transitions quite smoothly into Marine/Tank or pure Bio (vs Mech).

For a Marine/Tank transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory for Siege Tank production, take your third base, start your 4th-6th gas geysers, and start another Engineering Bay+Armory for more upgrades. With your midgame push, confirm what unit composition your opponent is going, and play aggressively/passively accordingly.

For a pure Bio transition (if your opponent is playing Mech), start another Engineering Bay and Armory to continue your upgrades as you take your 3rd Command Center and keep your opponent pinned back. Threaten boosted Medivac drops whenever possible, but do not over commit your army if your opponent has an adequate defense.

Pros and Cons

This build is a safe build that also opens aggressively. With this build, you can pick off Marines and SCV, while simultaneously getting a full scout of your opponents base and stressing their multitasking. This build also has a heavy Marine follow up, and can deal with Banshees or 1/1/1 all-ins rather well due to the Reactor/Tech lab first. This transitions into normal Bio play but gives you the advantage due to early harass and map control.

However, this build performs poorly against early Hellion openings. If you scout Reactored Hellions, cease Reaper production instantly and transition into faster Marine/Marauder production. Also, if your opponent holds the Reapers cost-effectively with a 1rax FE or CC First (either due to you mis-microing, or them having a solid defense), then you will be behind going into the midgame economically.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,Barracks,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Reaper,SCV,SCV,Reaper,Reaper,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Barracks,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,CallMule,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,Marine,CombatShield,SCV,Marine,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Refinery,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,Factory,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,EngineeringBay,StimPack,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SCV,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,CallMule,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marine,CallMule,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,LiftFactoryFromReactor,TechLabOnFactory,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:32:48 AM;

This mass Reaper build order gets 2 Reactored Barracks cranking out 4 Reapers at a time in order to overwhelm your opponent with purely mass Reaper.

Scouting

There is minimal SCV scouting with this build because you will open the same regardless of what your opponent is making. The majority of your scouting comes from your constant Reaper attacks.

Against anything but Banshees, constantly produce Reapers to overwhelm your opponent. Against Banshees, be sure to cancel your Reaper production and start producing 4 Marines at a time. If you have done significant economic damage, then getting an Engineering Bay for a Missile Turret is not a bad idea either.

Transitions

This build actually transitions pretty well into a decent midgame for being an all-in. However, you can only transition into Bio after opening with this build because it is hard to utilize your quick Reactors and two Barracks early on if you are trying to transition into Mech. When you feel like you cannot do any more damage with your Reapers, be sure to stop Reaper production and begin your Bio upgrades.

For a standard Bio follow-up, get your natural expansion, start Marine production, and get a 3rd Barracks with a Tech lab. This way you can start Stimpack, an Engineering Bay, Factory, and 3rd Refinery all at the same time just like as if you had opened with a normal 1rax FE into Medivacs.

For a fast upgrade transition, start your natural expansion, Marine production from the 2 Barracks, 2 Engineering Bays, and then +1/+1. As soon as you can, get one more Barracks with a Tech lab so that you can start researching Stimpack. Then, you can take your third Refinery and get a Factory to go into Reactored Medivacs and +2/+2.

For a follow-up timing attack, start your natural expansion, Marine production, and a Factory instantly.  Get a Tech lab on the Factory and start Siege Tank production in order to hit a very fast Marine/Tank push with your second Siege Tank. Behind this contain/attack, you can get your 3rd base, 3rd and 4th Refineries, double Engineering Bays, and 2 or 3 more Barracks (get Stimpack and Combat Shields).

Execution

As soon as your first Reapers pop, start being aggressive. Your number one goal is to deny your opponents Factory for as long as possible (Hellions or Widow Mines can be difficult to maneuver around), but in order to do this, you have to be in your opponents face with your Reapers as soon as they are built. Also, with your constant harass, be sure to dwindle your opponents Marine count without committing too hard and losing any Reapers.

Your Reaper count increases very quickly, and when you get around 6 to 8 Reapers, you can truly overwhelm most units your opponent can have.  Thus, focus on killing his army with your initial Reapersyou will be able to kill his SCVs once his army is dead.

In general, if your opponent sees what you are doing, you are in trouble.  Thus, it is suggested that at least one of your Barracks is build outside your base (even just at your natural will sometimes work fine). However, you can proxy both Barracks outside your main to make this build a little more all-in too. This also works for some mind games because if your opponent scouts you with a Refinery but no Barracks in your main, he will most likely try to defend proxy Marauders (a defense that is awful on most maps against mass Reaper).

Pros and Cons

This build is very aggressive and can catch many opponents off-guard.  With a hilarious amount of Reapers, you are usually able to overwhelm their army within the first 8 minutes. However, even if the all-in does fail, it can still transition into a 11-12 minute Bio+Stimpack/Medivac timing.

However, if you do not do much damage, you will be quite behind your opponent in tech (and possibly income). Also, this build can be easily scouted if an SCV sees both Reactors building before a single unit, so at least one of the Barracks must be proxied outside of your main.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Refinery,OrbitalCommand,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,DoubleReapers,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleReapers,SCV,DoubleReapers,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleReapers,DoubleReapers,CallMule,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:32:48 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '7 Roach Rush', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This classic 7 Roach Rush all-in is a great build for newer players to learn one base macro with. It hits a very quick timing that can crush through inexperienced or unsuspecting opponents.

Scouting

This build can be performed against any opener Terran has. The only scouting you need to do is send your initial 2 Overlords to your opponent?s base in order to spot both where your opponent is spawned and whether or not they have a Bunker or Marauders that you will have to break down or fight.

Transitions

This 7 Roach Rush build is a strong 1 base attack that opens with a lot of units and few Drones, so your follow-up will be very slow. That being said, you should start to float some minerals as you are reaching your opponent?s base, so start a natural Hatchery, build a lot more Drones, and get Metabolic Boost as soon as possible. Going for a Lair and getting a Banelings Nest in order to start a Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk composition is a strong way to deal with Terran in the midgame.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong 1 base attack that can crush your opponent early before they have their midgame even established. However, this build can be held off if your opponent scouts it and prepares with a repaired Bunker or Marauders if they have opened with a 1 base play of their own. It also is much less economical than any Hatchery First openers.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Queen,Zergling,RoachWarren,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:32:48 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '3gate Proxy Oracle All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This micro-intensive build rushes for a proxy Stargate, and then pumps out Oracles to do damage to your opponents mineral line while simultaneously crushing through your opponents front with a strong Gateway+Mothership Core army.

Attack your opponents main mineral line with 1st Oracle as soon as it finishes (@6:15ish), and push at front with Zealot/Stalker/Mothership Core.

Scouting

This build is an all-in that makes a lot of units, so is safe in general vs an aggressive opponent  the only scouting you need to do is spot where your opponent has spawned and whether or not they have taken gas. If you are performing this build vs a gasless Terran, you can be much more aggressive with your initial 3 units and oracle. Versus a gassing Terran, you must be wary of Widow Mines, so be sure not to clump up your units when pushing up ramps or going into your opponents mineral line with your Oracles.

Transitions

This build is an all-in, so note that there is no clear transition out of it.  Continue making oracles (up to 3 or 4) and warping in Stalkers so that you can break the front. Note that if your opponent does eventually hold and you end up losing your entire army, then you are most likely behind both economically and in tech. Only expand and continue producing Probes once/if you break the front and you are just making sure that you have enough economy to follow up with a win.

Pros and Cons

This build hits very early with a proxied Oracle, taking advantage of the weakness of early game Marines without upgrades. This build is so strong because it gives you enough units to pressure both your opponents front and their mineral line simultaneously. It also then gives you the infrastructure needed to warp-in enough Gateway units to eventually bust down your opponents front.

However, this build is a very micro intensive build  you must be target firing with your Oracle in the main, while not losing any of the units in the front, usually for at least 3 minutes. It is also weak vs Widow Mines if you have poor control. Lastly, note that this build is in fact an all-in, so doing some damage but losing your entire army does put you behind by quite a bit.

Tips

- Chronoboost your initial Stalker so that you deny scouting from your opponent as soon as possible.
- Do not get your initial Probe trapped in your opponents base or killed, for that will force you to send another Probe to build the proxy Pylon and lose more mining time.
- You have to target fire individual SCVs for the Pulsar Beam to be most effective.
- One Oracle can take down 4 Marines if it has enough energy for Pulsar Beam the entire time.
- You can use the Oracles Envision spell for mobile detection in case your opponent has opened Widow Mine or Banshee.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '8-8-8 Proxy Reaper', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This all-in gets the fastest possible Reaper with which to do damage against your opponent. It then follows up with another Barracks so that you can make enough Reapers to overwhelm your opponent and outright win the game before it has even begun.

Scouting

You will be doing this build no matter what, so there is no SCV scouting.  The rest of your scouting will come from your Reapers seeing what your opponent has. However, an interesting SCV timing to note: you will reach a very nice proxy location with your SCV on most 2 person maps if you send it out exactly as you get 50 minerals for the first time at 8 supply.

Transitions

There is no defined transition from this build; it is basically all-in after all.  However, if your opponent goes for very quick roaches then you might want to add-on Tech labs and get Marauders. Besides that, you should have enough Reapers to evenly trade with anything your opponent can make, as long as you can stutter step appropriately.

Tips

- Do NOT lose any of your first 3 Reapers. They are the most important part of this build  applying the early pressure, forcing Drones to be pulled, and most importantly stopping Queens/Roaches from being made. If you lose them, you will most likely lose the game.
- Do not stop for Hatcheries or buildings of any kind. Go straight for the Drones and force some to be pulled off the worker line. If your opponent has their full economy up they will simply outproduce you.
- The only micro you have to do is stutter step against Zerglings/Drones, and pull back the weakest Reaper against Queens.
- 4 Reapers will kill a Queen without you losing a single one of them as long as you pull the targeted Reaper back in time.
- In order to hit the exact build order supplies above, you will have to cut some SCVs for several seconds. I highly recommend watching the tutorial replays (and using the Take Command button with a friend to see how you match up to it) until you get a hang of the build.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,GoOutScv,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,SCV,SCV,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,Reaper,Barracks,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Reaper,SCV,Reaper', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:32:48 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '15 Gas Raven Expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This fast expansion build created by Maru uses a lot of scouting in order to stay safe against Reapers and Banshees, getting out enough Marines and the infrastructure needed to defend all sorts of aggression that early-game TvT can have.

Scouting

Figuring out your opponents opening so that you can react appropriately when you are performing this build is crucial. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that you SCV scout around 12 or 13 supply in order to see whether your opponent has opened gas first or not.

If your SCV gets into your opponents base and sees that your opponents Barracks is delayed compared to yours, you know that they are opening gas first  the most likely scenario being Polts Gas First Banshee Build.  However, there are some Gas First Hellion openers, so stick around until the first Marine pops so that you can see what add-ons your opponent is making. A fast Tech lab usually will be swapped off onto the Starport for a fast Banshee. A fast Reactor can be used to swap off and go for Hellions.  Against Hellion play, build your Command Center and keep your Marines on the high ground.

If you get into your opponents base and see that your opponent has mined more gas than you have, the most likely scenario is that they are opening with Reapers. Note that even if you do not get into your opponents base, you can still tell a Reaper is coming by leaving your scouting SCV next to your opponents Barracks to spot whether the first unit to pop out is a Marine or a Reaper. Against Reaper play, build your Command Center and position your Marines on the high ground. If your opponent commits to 2rax Reaper or Mass Reaper play, transitioning into Innovations Marine/Hellion Expand to stay safe (instead of taking a 2nd gas and instantly opening with a Starport) is a common reaction. With the Reactored Hellion follow-up you can seize map control and deal with Reapers quite easily.

If your opponent is opening with an expansion of their own or has mined the same amount of gas as you have, then consider cutting the Raven and going into delayed Cloaked Banshee OR Siege Tank production of your own. Whichever you choose is personal preference.

When your second Orbital Command finishes and you are still worried about a 1 base play, consider scanning your opponents main base.  Against 1 base non-Banshee play, starting Siege Tanks and using your Raven for Seeker Missile is an easy way to stay safe. Against 1 base Banshee play, position your Marines and Raven near your production or mineral line as you start a Viking or two for extra defense.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either Marine/Tank/Medivac or Mech play.

When transitioning into Marine/Tank play, against Mech and 3CC builds you can get away with starting your 3rd Command Center right away and following-up with 2 Barracks with Tech labs (to start Stimpack/Combat Shields), 3 Refineries, and 2 Engineering bays.

Against a player opening straight into Bio play, however, it is necessary to start a Tech lab on your initial Barracks as soon as possible for a quicker Stimpack. Then, after taking a 2nd Refinery, you can build a 2nd Barracks onto the naked Reactor and start Siege Tank production to take yourself into the midgame. This is followed up by a 3rd Command Center (between 8:00-8:30), 1 more Barracks, both Refineries at your natural expansion, and 2 Engineering Bays. Not having Stimpack completed in time for the inevitable 10ish minute drop play can be a game changer because with the new Medivacs boosting around your main and natural, it is very easy to get caught out of position and take a lot of damage for free.

Another possible follow-up is going for Mech play. By starting a 3rd Command Center instantly, getting all 4 Refineries, and making 2 more Factories and an Armory, youll instantly be at the midgame infrastructure you need. Be sure to make Vikings for drop defense and start your Siege Tank production instantly so that you have a healthy Siege Tank count to defend any early drops/pressure.

Tips

- Fully read the Scouting section of this build before performing it in a game.  The reactions to scouting information as presented in the Scouting section must be learned before this build is even worth performing in a real game.
- SCV scout with this build at 12 or 13 supply.
- If you are absolutely sure your opponent is not opening with Banshee play, then starting delayed Banshee production of your own instead of the Raven is a great way to get midgame map control and a lot more scouting information.
- Against the first Banshee, you might need to pull all of your Marines to your production or mineral line while you wait for the Raven to pop.  This is completely fine  try to minimize damage by pulling all of your SCVs to one location so that your Raven provides detection over all of your vulnerable spots once it is out.
- Anticipate how many Banshees your opponent is making and either continue to produce Vikings or stop after 1 or 2 for safety.
- Be sure to transition into your midgame infrastructure as soon as you have successfully defended the Banshees.

Pros and Cons

This build defends early pressure quite easily, while getting a quick expansion and going into the midgame. Also, this build is incredibly versatile when it comes to transitions, for opening with a 1/1/1 grants you the freedom to transition into nearly anything.

However, this build requires a lot of scouting in order to be performed effectively. The reactions and transitions you must perform depend entirely on your scouting information and interpretation of your opponents build order.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Factory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,Refinery,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Starport,DoubleMarines,SCV,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,LandStarportOnTechLab,Raven,WidowMine,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,ScannerSweep,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,LiftStarportFromTechLab,LandFactoryOnTechLab,SiegeTank,SupplyDepot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:32:48 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '15 gas FE into Mine Drop to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reactored Rax FE gives you enough Marines to stay safe against early Protoss pressure, while still getting a fast expansion. Then it transitions into a fast Marine/Widow Mine drop to hit your opponent with some pressure of your own. Interestingly, this build can also transition into standard Bio play or macro Mech play.

Scouting

This build is largely safe against any early pressure that Protoss can apply because it gives you a Reactored Barracks to pump out Marines two at a time. Also, if you are feeling unsafe, you have the minerals after your reactor finishes to place down a Bunker at your natural. Also, if your opponent is doing a 1 base all-in, then instead of being aggressive with your Marines/Widow Mines, you can keep them in your main and defend your Bunker/main. By simply constantly producing Widow Mines, Marines, and Medivacs to keep replenishing your defenses, you can remain safe against most all-ins. However seeing the all-ins coming is crucial. Scouting your opponents natural expansion timing with an SCV is huge (if your opponent does not have an expansion started by around 5:30, expect an all-in). Besides seeing an all-in coming, the rest of your midgame scouting will come from seeing how your opponent defends the Widow Mine drop.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because it gets a good economy, but also enough Marines to defend early game Protoss pokes. Then, the Marine/Widow Mine drop gives you complete map control AND keeps your opponent in the dark as to what followup you are doing (Mech/Bio/3CC). Not to mention that if your opponent is not careful, this build can get Widow Mines in your opponents mineral lines and land some huge hits on Probes, essentially winning the game instantly.

However, this build is more vulnerable to later all-ins such as Void ray or Blink+Mothership core all-ins than more standard bio play (because you will not have stim yet), so be sure to position your Widow Mines defensively and add on more bunkers against a Protoss that you have scouted isnt expanding. Also, with poor Medivac control, you can very easily lose your Medivac and all the Widow Mines if you are not careful. Lastly, this build is not quite as economical as a 1rax FE build, but it still gets a pretty reasonably fast expand, so its not too far behind a 1rax FE build in terms of economy at all.

Tips

- Early game Stalker/Mothership Core pressure may be hard to deal with, but position your Marines effectively and hold on until you get out a Widow Mine in order to defend your base.
- Once you have pinned your opponent on an aggressive build (for instance, by scouting a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), do NOT move out; instead, posture your Widow Mines and Marines in an appropriately defensive position.
- Oracles flat out destroy marines, so if you are fighting an opponent going for Stargate, position your Widow Mines by the mineral line and even consider getting out one turret per base.
- When committing to an attack, boost in and drop one Widow Mine at your opponents main-to-natural ramp in order to trap his army on one half of his base. Once you have his ramp locked down, you will have several seconds of complete control of the half of his base where his army is not located. Use these seconds to kill workers and/or position a mine in a crucial location.
- Above all else, the strength of this build is non-stop harass/pressure.  Do NOT lose your Medivac or your entire map control will disappear.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SupplyDepot,SCV,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Factory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,Bunker,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SCV,Starport,WidowMine,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,WidowMine,SupplyDepot,Medivac,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Refinery,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,EngineeringBay,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,TechLabOnFactory,ReactorOnStarport,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,Refinery,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,CallMule,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,LandRaxOnTechLab,StimPack,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,LandRaxOnTechLab,SupplyDepot,DoubleMedivacs,Refinery,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMedivacs,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CombatShield,CallMule,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMedivacs,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,SupplyDepot,InfantryArmorLevel1', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:32:48 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '15 Gas Marine-Hellion Expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This fast expansion build created by Innovation uses Hellions to stay safe against Reapers, Banshees, and Hellbatsall while taking map control.

Scouting

Scouting with this build until you get your first Hellions out is not necessary.  However if you want to SCV scout, checking your opponents gas timing clues you in on what they could possibly be doing.

If your SCV sees that your opponent has mined more gas than you have, the most likely are opening with Reapers. However, even if you do not get into your opponents base, you can still tell a Reaper is coming by leaving your scout next to your opponents Barracks to spot whether it dies to a Marine or a Reaper. Your first 2 Marines positioned in your main at a Reaper jump-up spot, followed up by the Reactor for extra Marine production should crush any aggressive Reaper play if you react with and position your initial Marines well. With the Reactored Hellion follow-up you can seize map control and spot if there are any other pushes coming.

When your second Orbital Command finishes and you are still worried about a 1 base play, consider scanning your opponents main base.  Against 1 base play, be sure to have good vision around your base to prevent elevators and to defend your front with a Bunker. Also, a Missile Turret per mineral line with one Viking will shut down any Widow Mine Drops into Cloak Banshee openers. Lastly, if your opponent is going for Hellbat drops, then producing more than 6 Hellions and starting a Viking can be really helpful for your defensenormal Hellions do quite well against Hellbats, and Vikings do quite well at deterring Medivacs.

Execution

If your opponent invested more than 2 Reapers before expanding into bio play, then this is your cue to do heavy damage. If he played greedy and didnt build a bunker at his natural, you can go in with your 4 Hellions, 6 Marines and your first Medivac and kill his un-upgraded Marines. If there is a Bunker at the natural, then simply elevator your Marines and then Hellions into your opponents main and kill as many units as you can.

Against Mech play you might have to play a bit more conservative with your aggression because in Hellion vs Hellion fights, the player who was positioned correctly before the fight usually has the advantage. Instead of committing to an attack or elevator, pulling your army back and placing down a quick 3rd Command Center is a safer way to play.

Against standard Bio play, you can attempt to hit a Marine/Hellion timing at his front with your first 4 Hellions, 6 Marines, and a Medivac. Or, if your opponent is too well defended at the front, perform a 4 Hellion drop and harass his SCVs instead. Getting your 2nd Barracks and starting Stimpack before taking your 3rd Command Center is crucial to staying safe against 10 minute Bio timings and drop play. Alternatively, going Mech and producing Widow Mines/Siege Tanks as you take your third base is a strong way to stay safe as well.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into anything: Marine/Tank or Mech play. Note that as stated in the Execution section above, the follow-up you can do after you get your initial Marine/Hellion/Medivac army is completely dependent on your own preference and the play style of your opponent.

When transitioning into Bio play, against Mech and 3CC builds you can get away with starting your 3rd CC right away and following-up with 2 Barracks with Tech labs (to start Stimpack/Combat Shields), 3 Refineries, and 2 Engineering bays. Against more traditional Bio play it is necessary to start a Tech lab on your initial Barracks for a quicker Stimpack. Then, after taking a 2nd Refinery, you can build a 2nd Barracks onto the naked Reactor and start Siege Tank production to take yourself into the midgame. This is followed up by a 3rd Command Center (between 8:00-8:30), 1 more Barracks, both Refineries at your natural expansion, and 2 Engineering bays. Not having Stimpack completed in time for the inevitable 10ish minute drop play can be a game changer because with the new Medivacs boosting around your main and natural, it is very easy to get caught out of position and take a lot of damage for free.

ForGG does an interesting follow-up where he simply constantly produces Hellions  sometimes going up to 20+ Hellions  and overwhelms his opponents before they have Stimpack or enough Siege Tanks to deal with this attack. Mass Hellions are surprisingly good against opponents who make Hellbats or try drop play without a perfect follow-up.

Another possible follow-up is going for Mech play. This is easily achieved by keeping the Factory onto the Reactor for more Hellions, getting all 4 Refineries while starting more Factories, and starting your 3rd Command Center very quickly. Building some Vikings for drop defense will definitely come in handy as well.

Pros and Cons

This build defends early pressure quite easily, while getting a quick expansion and going into the midgame. Also, once your first Medivac is out, you hit your opponent with lots of pressure early on to kick start an aggressive game. Finally, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for opening with a 1/1/1 grants you the freedom to go into nearly anything.

However, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades. Also, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Factory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,Starport,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SCV,OrbitalCommand,SCV,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,Medivac', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:32:48 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Alicia 12-12 Colossus All-In', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build utilizes an unconventional Gateway and gas timing to produce a fast Mothership Core for scouting before smoothly transitioning into a 2 Colossus All-in.

Attack your opponent when your 2nd Colossus finishes (@9:30ish) with 2 Colossi, 3 Stalkers, 3 Sentries, and a Mothership Core with about 45 Probes at home.

Scouting

Do not Probe scout with this build. Because you are using a 12/12 opening, you will have an extremely early Mothership Core for immediate scouting. Your Mothership Core should be directly rallied to the enemy base upon completion.

The early Mothership Core allows you to see exactly what a Terran is aiming for. If they are aiming for Factory aggression with a Starport simply chronoboost out 2 Observers, placing one in each base. Position your 3 Stalkers in the main to catch a drop. Bring your Mothership Core home and use it to defend the natural with Photon Overcharge. This defensive setup should allow you to defend any multi-pronged aggression from the Terran.

If it is merely a 2 base, 3 Barracks opener, then proceed as normal.

Transitions

As this is an all-in, the transitions for this build are heavily dependent on the damage you deal. If you kill a significant amount of workers but find yourself unable to finish your opponent off, transition into normal Blink/Colossus play. If you do not kill many workers and lose your army, then you most likely will lose to a follow-up counterattack. If you trade armies but do eventually lose your own, you are free to instantly transition into anything you wantBlink/Colossus, Chargelot/Archon, or Storm play are all equally viable. Remember to start 2 Forges and chronoboost your upgrades to catch up in the upgrade war.

Produce a third Colossus and leave it at home along with your Mothership Core. This allows you to effectively defend counter aggression with 2 Photon Overcharges. You have enough punch in your frontal push with Forcefield and Guardian Shield not to require Time Warp.

Only chronoboost your 10th and 13th Probe before the completion of your Cybernetics Core. You need to bank energy to allow you to simultaneously chronoboost your Mothership Core and first Stalker. Otherwise your scouting information is delayed and a Reaper can play havoc with your main.

Once you have completed your Mothership Core and initial Stalker, return to chronoboosting Probes until the completion of your Robotics Bay. At this point exclusively chronoboost Colossi. If you find you have spare Nexus energy chronoboost Thermal Lance but prioritize accelerating your Colossus count  your push begins once both Colossi have been completed.

Pros and Cons

This all-in is one of the most difficult to scout builds currently available to Protoss. To most Terran players it will look like standard macro play and may even prompt incorrect reactions such as earlier Medivac aggression or a fast 3rd Command Center. Also, because of the fast Mothership Core scout, you will almost always be able to identify Terrans early game build structure (3rax, 1/1/1, etc).

However, because your Mothership Core stays at home for defense and you have no upgrades to fall back on, your attack is fully all-inthere is no way to retreat your Colossus safely if your attack fails and you are certain to fall behind in upgrades as the game stretches on.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Stalker,Chronoboost,WarpgateUpgrade,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Assimilator,Stalker,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,Nexus,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Chronoboost,Stalker,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Observer,RoboticsBay,Assimilator,Assimilator,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,WarpInSentry,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Pylon,Probe,Probe,ExtendedThermalLance,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:32:48 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Bomber Reaper FE to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE, optimized by Startale Bomber, gets out exactly one Reaper for scouting as well and a ridiculously fast Command Center. Then it follows up with a Bio army with just as much strength as a gasless 1rax FE can provide.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they get an expansion (or note if they do not expand by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Also, if you do not know whether your opponent has a Stargate or not, it is a safe plan to build one Missile Turret per mineral line to defend any Oracle shenanigans.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and Medivacs. After this build, get a 3rd Command Center, 3 more Barracks (for a total of 8), and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to head into a strong, late game army.

Note: It is completely viable to replace the 4th and 5th Barracks in this build with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost, most Terrans (including Startale Bomber) have been getting lots of Barracks early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having those extra reinforcements.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important  be sure to mine exactly 100 Gas so that you have enough for the Reaper and Reactor and no more.  Getting your natural Command Center up before the 2nd Supply Depot is a strength of this build.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add a 2nd Bunker at the front, and consider getting a Missile Turret in each mineral line.
- Oracles, even with an expansion, massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you have to instantly get out one Missile Turret per mineral line.
- The gas timings of this build are somewhat more delayed than what you might be used to if you usually play with a gasless 1rax FE.  Therefore, be sure to cut all Marauder production until after your Starport has completed.
- When you move out with your Medivacs, be sure to boost in and out of where your opponent is expecting.  Forcing out the Mothership Cores energy can be the difference between an quick win and a potential loss.

Pros and Cons

This build is good because it gives you the economy and infrastructure on par with a Wings of Liberty style 1rax FE. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Getting such a fast Reactor gives you enough marines to defend early game Stalker + Mothership Core harass.  Finally, this build takes no detours and goes directly into Bio+Medivac play, so your Stim+Medivac aggression happens much sooner than if you go for an early Widow Mine Drop.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes, especially if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that with such a low Marine count in the early game, fast Oracles can do a lot of damage if your scouting/turret timing is not perfect.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Barracks,Bunker,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,StimPack,Marine,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,Factory,EngineeringBay,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,Marine,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Marine,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Starport,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnFactory,ScannerSweep,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,CombatShield,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,SCV,DoubleMedivacs,Marauder,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Barracks,Barracks,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,InfantryArmorLevel1,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,DoubleMedivacs,SCV,SCV,Barracks,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:32:49 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Bomber 2 Base 5 Rax Push', @SC2VersionID = '2.0.5', @Description = 'General Overview

This variant on the standard 1rax FE build gets the midgame infrastructure up much earlier for a lot of midgame aggression, while sacrificing early safety against one and early two base Protoss attacks.

Scouting

When you send your scouting SCV, look for the number of gasses your opponent has, their Nexus energy, and also the units they are producing out of the Gateway. If he only has 1 gas before his stalker pops, check to see whether your opponent gets his natural at around 5:15 (You can hide your SCV nearby and then run it in around 5:30 to check for an expansion later if need be). If he has 2 gas or is not spending his chronoboost, then be wary of any sort of early attack.

Tips

- To confirm that your opponent is not all-inning you, have an SCV (or scan) go to his natural just before the 6 minute mark.  A 4gate will hit before this timing, but 2 bunkers and repair should be able to hold a 4gate easily enough; all other all-ins hit much later and this scout will give you enough time to mount an appropriate defense.
- You cannot afford Marauders with this build until you start the Starport. The 100 extra minerals and 50 gas from making 2 Marauders at a time will slow down the push by over a minute.
- Take map control when you initially poke out with your first two Medivacs. Do NOT engage Protoss yet though. This build sets up your infrastructure for a lot of reinforcements, but does not increase your army size until those reinforcements have actually arrived.
- Once the first or second wave of units from all 5 Barracks have popped (you should be making 3 Marauders and 4 marines at a time), straight up fight Protoss? army. Spread your army, kite Zealots, pick up units trapped between forcefields and zealots with Medivacs, and dodge storms as best you can. However, do not forget to build reinforcing units, and do not stop the aggression unless you are forced to. During this aggression, you also get to see what army composition your opponent has.  Get a 4th Refinery.  Then react appropriately to Colossus by making Vikings (and possibly a 2nd Starport) and to High Templar by making Ghosts.

Transitions

During the fighting, place down your 3rd CC, 2nd Engineering Bay and Armory, and Ghost academy or 2nd Starport to counter your opponent?s HTs or Colossi. Fighting your opponent across the map forces them to reveal which tech path they?ve gone down and safely give you the time you need to counter it before it comes to your base.

Pros and Cons

This 1rax FE variant cuts many early-game corners compared to other 1rax FEs.  Delaying the 2nd Refinery means that you cannot afford any Marauders at all until after your Starport has been started. Thus, in case your opponent does an early-game attack, you have to rely on Bunkers and SCVs to repair and tank damage much more than you would in other builds. However, what this build lacks in the early game it more than makes up for in the mid game. Getting five Barracks up that fast means that you can apply a lot of midgame aggression against your opponent.

Simple, economical, and deceptively dangerous, Bomber takes us back to 2012 with an incredibly early 16 Marine Combat Shield Push that simultaneously takes a 6:00 3rd. An excellent low APM alternative for players who dislike Reapers and Hellions.

Scouting

Because you are not opening Reapers, you are in danger of unexpected Roach or Speedling attacks. And because you are not making Hellions, you will have difficulty confirming the existence of a Zerg third base if Speedlings are on the map, as well as being vulnerable to unscouted Baneling Busts. As such, your only SCV scout is crucial in determining if your Zerg opponent has opened with gas or not.

If your opponent has opened gasless, keep your scouting SCV alive and hidden as long as possible to confirm the existence of a third base by 6:30. If no third is taken by 6:30, it is worth scanning, as many dangerous builds, such as Soulkeys 1-1 Roach Timing, start gasless off of two bases.

If your opponent has opened gas but stopped mining at 100 gas, assume that Speedlings are on the way. As such, depending on how quickly your opponent chose to take his gas, a wall off is necessary before six minutes. It is fine to use your 3rd CC as part of your natural wall off on certain maps, such as Frost, Yeonsu, and Polar Night. However, if your opponent went for much faster Speedlings (Gas -> Pool -> Hatch), then it is advisable to wall off ASAP using Depots and bunkers, and delaying your 3rd CC. Additionally, consider not performing your Marine timing if the speedling count is abnormally high (30 or above).

If your opponent has opened gas but has continued mining past 100, it is necessary to check whether or not Metabolic Boost is researching with your scouting SCV. Beyond that, scan to see what is coming your way and build extra bunkers if necessary. You are specifically looking for a combination of the following: obvious tech cues (baneling nest, roach warren, fast lair), lack of Queens/Creep Spread (if there are only two injecting, then something is wrong), lack of Evolution Chambers, lack of a timely third base, and a flood of overlords.

It is highly reommended you do not perform your timing unless it is obvious your opponent is opening nonthreatening gas tech, such as Overlord Speed or very fast upgrades. And finally, depending on what you scout, if it becomes very obvious that no timing will occur, consider getting Stimpack instead of Combat Shields, as well as producing Marauders from your tech labbed Barracks.

Transitions

Because you have already invested so much infrastructure into Barracks and infantry upgrades, your only transition from this build is a bio based composition. However, because you have invested no money whatsoever into Factory tech, you can transition smoothly into Biomine, Biobat, Biobat with Thors, Marine Tank, or even Pure Bio.

Additionally, the Factory and Engineering Bay ordering is entirely up to the users discretion. If you feel you are in danger of a counter all in, or want faster Medivacs for aggression, then start the Factory first. If you feel that you do not want to fall behind in upgrades, start two Engineering bays first.

Tips

Your first priority with this build is accurately assessing whether or not you can do damage with a timing push.

If you feel you can do damage with the timing, do your best to ensure your opponent has as little idea of it as possible. Have lone marines ready at your base to deny Overlord scouting, and hide the bulk of your marines on the main ramp connecting to the natural base. Keep your Barracks away from the edges of your base; especially the one with a researching Tech Lab. If there is a way to construct a third base that an Overlord can obviously see it (such as by the natural choke at Polar Night, where there is almost always an overlord), then that would be best. Most Zergs upon seeing such an early third will let their guard down and drone heavily.

As youre moving out with the Marine squad at 7:00, have at least two scans saved and do your best to avoid obvious overlord positions, and either clear the towers beforehand (impossible vs Speedlings) or avoid them altogether if possible. The best possible scenario is you catch your opponent completely off guard with no Larva banked in the middle of a huge cycle of drones, with 16 marines at his third base.

Use your banked scans as best you can to clear huge swatches of creep, with priority on active tumors. If you do kill the third, use your discretion to decide whether or not attacking further into the natural (emphasis now on the Evolution Chambers or Nat Hatch) or retreating with your marines is the better choice.

DO NOT REINFORCE THIS PUSH. It relies heavily on the element of surprise. Once Zerg reacts and begins to produce cycles of defending units, your reinforcements (3 marines every 25 seconds) will be easily overwhelmed without force multipliers such as Widow Mines, Medivacs, or Battlecruisers.

During the actual engagements, stutter stepping and positioning are critical. Wedging all your marines into the mineral line of his third and using his hatchery as a choke seems to be the optimal engagement zone. If slow banes are involved, split as best you can without stim or target fire them down.

On the other hand, if you feel you cannot do damage with your timing, theres no problem whatsoever. Stay behind your walloff, make bunkers if necessary, and wait for Factory Tech and Medivacs to perform a standard creep clearing push. You are already ahead with your 6:00 3rd and triple MULE income.

Pros and Cons

This build is one of the most economical builds available while still having a surprising amount of potential to outright win a game. It also deflects non baneling based aggression excellently, such as Roach Ling timings. Additionally, the build has a surprising amount of creep clearing potential, as few Zergs will stand toe to toe with 16 Combat Shield Marines this early in the game; most Zergs will surrender their creep without a fight.

The weaknesses of this build, however, are equally apparent.If scouted, the push has a high chance of outright failing. In addition, because your infrastructure is so limited during and following the attack (3 mostly naked Barracks), you are extremely susceptible to counter all ins and heavy Baneling based counter attacks, especially after you kill their third but lose all 16 marines in the process.

And finally, because you have not opened Reapers or hellions, your information is extremely limited, and confirming the existence of a third base can be very difficult if you lose your scouting SCV too early on.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,OrbitalCommand,Marine,CommandCenter,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,Marine,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,OrbitalCommand,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Marine,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,CombatShield,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,CommandCenter,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Marine,Refinery,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,Marine,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,CallMule,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,EngineeringBay,EngineeringBay,ReactorOnBarracks,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,StimPack,OrbitalCommand,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,InfantryArmorLevel1,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Factory,Refinery,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marauder,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SCV,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Marauder,Armory,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,CallMule,TechLabOnFactory,Factory,SCV,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DrillingClaws,Barracks,Barracks,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,ConcussiveShells,InfantryWeaponsLevel2,InfantryArmorLevel2,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,ReactorOnFactory,CommandCenter,Marauder,DoubleMedivacs', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:32:49 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Dear 3gate Blink', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a 3 Gateways and Blink, using a Hallucinated Phoenix to scout for potential Dark Shrine or Stargate shenanigans. It produces a healthy Stalker count to apply pressure to your opponent or safely secure your expansion against any all-in.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker(s) back to the protection of your Sentry quickly if you have to defend an early attack.
The majority of your scouting comes from your Hallucinated Phoenix. Your phoenix should be able to get into your opponent?s main base and determine what tech route you see your opponent going.
- If your opponent is expanding quickly, then consider warping in Stalkers non-stop from a proxy Pylon as you all-in your opponent with a Blink all-in. Should you choose to expand instead, you will be slightly behind economically ? but with Blink.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then be sure that you do NOT over produce Stalkers.  Instead, expand and fall back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.
- If your opponent has a Stargate, then be sure to not take damage against early Phoenix or Oracles by initially positioning your Stalkers defensively. You can expand quite easily behind your Blink play and go into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame or all-in your opponent if you spot them taking a fast expansion behind the Stargate.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then consider getting a Robotics Facility instantly in order to make one Observer for detection against DTs. If you are sure your opponent is also opening with Blink, then constantly produce Immortals and defend a natural expansion OR skip the Robotics Facility entirely and try to win the Blink Stalker vs Blink Stalker micro war.

Transitions

This build is a very safe opener that allows you either to all-in your opponent with Blink Stalkers or transitions into a macro game quite easily. However, the actual steps you take to transition into it often depend completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with. This is why scouting with the Hallucinated Phoenix and generally being active on the map with your Blink Stalkers is crucial.
If you choose to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly produce Stalkers 3 at a time from your proxy Pylons and attack as soon as Blink Research is finished (@7:40ish). Bait out a Planetary Nexus and/or kill the Mothership Core and as many Sentries as possible before fully committing to an attack. If your opponent is on one base, you can still expand at home ? using your Sentry to force field the ramp to stop his army from coming down and engaging you with his entire army.
In Twilight vs Stargate macro games, abuse your mobility to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you have a strong midgame Chargelot/Immortal/Archon army ready. In Twilight vs Robotics macro games, again abuse your mobility to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you get a healthy Chargelot/Archon count up.  Keep tabs on your opponent?s tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Twilight vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponent?s potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by getting a Robotics Facility and producing Observers/Immortals or by winning the Blink Stalker vs Blink Stalker position battles in the open field.
The most common way to start the transition into Chargelot/Immortal/Archon is by starting a 2nd Nexus, a Robotics Facility and 2 more Assimilators, a Forge for +1 Ground Weapons, and Zealot Charge research in that order. Add on the Templar Archives and Archons when you can afford it.

Tips

- Once you start your Mothership Core, save your chronoboost so that you can dump it all into Blink Research. Only 1 or 2 chronoboosts should be spent on Warpgate (unless you spot your opponent going for very early aggression).
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial Stalkers to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap?s 3gate All-in).
- Against Stargate play, be sure to position your units to defend your mineral line from potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- If you choose to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly chronoboost Blink and then later your Gateways to get the maximal amount of units out with Blink as soon as possible. Bait out a Planetary Nexus and/or kill the Mothership Core and as many Sentries as possible before fully committing to an attack. If your opponent is on one base, you can still expand at home ? using your Sentry to force field the ramp to stop his army from coming down and engaging you with his entire army.
- If you choose to expand behind this build, do not produce more than 8 Stalkers which you should use to take map control and poke your opponent?s front. Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases. Transitioning into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon unit composition is very strong.

Pros and Cons

This build is a versatile, aggressive build that can pressure your opponent or defend basically any all-in with Blink Stalkers. It gets a fast Hallucinated Phoenix scout your opponent?s main base and let you know if you need detection, should reposition your army, or all-in your opponent.
However, this build requires a lot of scouting information to be executed effectively, so getting a Hallucination into your opponent?s base is crucial.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'DeMusliM Reaper FE', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This HotS Reaper FE, optimized by Flash and DeMusliM, gets out exactly one Reaper for scouting and a ridiculously fast Engineering Bay for an early +1 Infantry Attack in order to hit a 10 minute timing with +1/+1, Stimpack, and Medivacs.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (opening with a Reaper FE means that you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they expand (or note if they do not get a fast expansion by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Also, if you do not know whether or not your opponent has built a Stargate, taking advantage of your ridiculously fast Engineering Bay to build a Missile Turret is not a bad idea too.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and Medivacs.  After this build, secure your 3rd Command Center, continue your upgrades with +2 Infantry Attack, build 6 more Barracks (for a total of 8), and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to go into a strong, late game army. Your fast third Command Center and early upgrades means that your late game army will be much stronger than your opponents assuming that you are able to deny their third base with your initial Medivac poke.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important  be sure to mine exactly 100 Gas so that you have enough for the Reaper and Reactor and no more.  Getting your natural Command Center up before the 2nd Supply Depot is a major strength of this build.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add a 2nd Bunker at the front, and consider getting a Missile Turret in each mineral line. 
- Oracles, even with an expansion, massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you have to instantly get out one Missile Turret per mineral line.
- The gas timings of this build are somewhat more delayed than what you might be used to if you usually play with a gasless 1rax FE.  Therefore, be sure to cut all Marauder production until after your Starport has completed.
- Try not to take any huge engages against your Protoss opponent with your initial Medivacs unless you are sure you can do damage.  With only 2 Barracks producing units, and such a fast 3rd Command Center, your army is not designed to outright win the game  rather to further your economic and upgrade advantage in order to win the game at a later point.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because it gives you the economy and infrastructure on par with a Wings of Liberty style 1rax FE. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Not to mention the fact that you also get a ridiculously early Engineering Bay in order to kick start your Bio upgrades very early. This build also takes no detours and goes directly into Bio+Medivac play, so your Stim+Medivac aggression happens much sooner than if you go for early Widow Mines.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes, especially if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that with such a low Marine count in the early game, fast Oracles can do a lot of damage if your scouting/Missile Turret timing is not perfect.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Bunker,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,EngineeringBay,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SCV,OrbitalCommand,Barracks,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,Factory,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Refinery,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,StimPack,SCV,SCV,Starport,DoubleMarines,Marine,ReactorOnFactory,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,ScannerSweep,Marauder,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,InfantryArmorLevel1,CallMule,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marauder,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Armory,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,CommandCenter,CallMule,SCV,SCV,DoubleMedivacs,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CombatShield', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:32:49 AM;

This build opens with a Stargate for Phoenix and some early ground units to provide the infrastructure necessary to react to every build an opposing Protoss might throw at you.

Benchmark: When your Nexus finishes (@6:45ish), you should have 3 Phoenix, 1 Sentry, 1 Stalker, a Mothership Core, and around 23 Probes.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker back to the protection of your Sentry quickly if you have to defend an early attack.

The majority of your scouting comes from your Phoenix. Your Phoenix should be able to get into your opponents main base and determine what tech route you see your opponent going.

- If your opponent is expanding quickly, then feel safe while applying some light harass with your Phoenix. You can dictate the pace of the game by committing to a lot of Phoenix or starting a Twilight Council or Robotics Facility and defaulting back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then be sure that deal some economic damage with your initial Phoenix. Either commit to Phoenix and Void Rays or default back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.
- If your opponent has a Stargate, then be sure to not take damage against early Phoenix or Oracles by initially positioning your units defensively.  Getting a healthy Phoenix lead against your opponent will most likely be enough for you to end the game.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then consider getting a Robotics Facility instantly in order to make one Observer for detection against DTs.  Alternatively, you can position your units with an Oracle at your main ramp and defend for a while. Regardless, do not make more Phoenix and instead transition into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame with your economic advantage.

Transitions

This build is a very safe opener that gives you the scouting capabilities and infrastructure to react to any build your opponent can perform. However, the actual steps you take to transition into a stable midgame often depend completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with. This is why scouting with your Phoenix and generally being active on the map (perhaps with a delayed scouting Probe) is crucial.

In Stargate vs Twilight macro games, harass your opponent with your Phoenix, but transition out of Stargate units into an economic Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame as soon as possible. In Stargate vs Robotics macro games, again harass your opponent to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you get a healthy Chargelot/Archon count up. Keep tabs on your opponents tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Stargate vs Stargate macro games, position your Phoenix more defensively while you chronoboost your Phoenix non-stop.

The most common way to start the transition into Chargelot/Immortal/Archon is by starting a Robotics Facility and 2 more Assimilators, followed by a Twilight Council and Forge for +1 Ground Weapons and Zealot Charge. Add on the Templar Archives and Archons when you can afford it.

Tips

- Once you start your Mothership Core, save your chronoboost so that you can dump it all into Phoenix. There is no need to chronoboost Warpgate (unless you spot your opponent going for very early aggression).
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial few Gateway units to stop a Probe from setting up a proxy Pylon and allowing for a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Traps 3gate All-in).
- Against Stargate play, position your Stargate units defensively around your mineral lines to defend potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- Otherwise, always be active with your Phoenixes. The main priority for the Phoenix is to get scouting information, for only when you have a full read on your opponents build can you can start chronoboosting probes and enter the midgame.
- Even though you open with a Stargate, transitioning into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon unit composition in the midgame can be very strong.
- When entering the late game, however, be sure to produce Tempest from your inactive Stargateespecially against a Colossus-based opponent.

Pros and Cons

This build is a versatile, economic build that can harass your opponent and provide the scouting information necessary to defend a fast expansion.  Also, your Phoenix can do terrible, terrible damage to Robo-based build such as duckdeoks 3Gate Robo, and even perform well in a macro game against greedy builds such as NaNiwas Safe Expand.

However, this build requires a lot of scouting information to be executed effectively. It also is quite difficult to defend early attacks if you do not kill your opponents proxy Pylon.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'FanTaSy Mine Drop into Banshee', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This aggressive build hits your opponent with relentless harassment, either outright winning the game or giving you a considerable economic advantage before even entering the midgame. Also, with Widow Mine and Banshee play, this build force a lot of scans  giving you another sort of economic advantage going into the midgame.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your 1st Refinery so as to check whether your opponent is opening Reapers or not. Against a Reaper player, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe and try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or an expansion at your natural with your first Marines.

Your next scout will come with your Widow Mine Drop. With this drop you can check what your opponents opener is. Against a Banshee player, you can following through with the build and trying to out-micro him in Banshee vs Banshee harass, or you can cancel your banshee and start a Viking and Engineering Bay for a Turret to play safe. Against a Hellbat Dropping player, make a few more Widow Mines to position them defensively against any incoming drop as you use your Widow Mine Drop and incoming Banshee to out-harass him. Against a player going for a similar Widow Mine Drop, you can either pull back and try to defend or attempt to do more SCV damage with your drop than he does with his.

Finally, when your first Banshee starts its harass, you will get a good look at everything else your opponent is doing when trying to transition into the midgame. Keep an eye out for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either Marine/Tank or Mech play quite easily.

When transitioning into Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production early in order to have a safe defense and later strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use.
- Keep your eyes peeled for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop a drop or Banshee. Do NOT drop on top of an active Widow Mine.
- With your initial Widow Mine drop, avoid Turrets at all costs. The main purpose of the drop is to force multiple scans, with a side goal of dealing crippling economic damage.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that were already weakened by the initial drop before attacking any of the full health SCVs.
- If your opponent has a Missile Turret already set up in his mineral line, then do not worry. Instead, camping a Terrans production with a Widow Mine and several Marines can be just as effectiveespecially with the Banshee follow-up that hits soon after.
- Always favor keeping your Medivac and Banshee alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural. You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very strong, aggressive play style that opens up with unrelenting harassment before even entering the midgame. With a Widow Mine drop and Banshee follow-up, you can kill many SCVs and also force your opponent to scan often  giving you another type of economic advantage. Finally, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for opening with a 1/1/1 grants you the freedom to go into nearly anything.

However, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades. Also, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,Factory,Refinery,CallMule,SCV,Marine,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,Starport,WidowMine,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,WidowMine,Medivac,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnStarport,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,Banshee,CloakingField,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,Banshee,TechLabOnFactory,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:32:49 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Dear Phoenix into Colossus', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Forge Fast Expand and then gets several Phoenix for map control and scouting. While you are using the scouting Phoenix, you transition into Colossus play in order to secure your third base and set up a stable midgame OR all-in your opponent with a Stalker/Colossus/Phoenix army.

Scouting

After any early game shenanigans are ruled out, as you have spotted your opponent?s third Hatchery going down, the rest of your scouting will come from your Phoenix.

Use your Phoenix to first pick off every Overlord on the map that is undefended by creep/Queens. Then use them to poke around your opponent?s base ? picking up units not protected by Spore Crawlers/Queens. Be sure to focus on what tech structures you see your opponent making. If you spot a swell of Roaches, stay on 2 bases and consider extra Immortals. If you spot a Hydralisk Den, be sure your Robotics Bay is constantly producing Colossus. If you spot a Spire, instantly get a Twilight Council and go for Blink/+2 Ground Weapons while you resume Phoenix production from your Stargate. You might have to cancel your Colossus production.

Transitions

This build can either all-in off of 2 bases or safely secure a third base to comfortably play a macro game.

If you are choosing to all-in with this build, be sure to go up to 8 Gateways and 3 Colossus with Extended Thermal Lance before moving out. Constantly reinforce with Stalkers as you use your +1/+1, 3-Colossus, 5-Phoenix, 8 Gateway all-in to crush through a Roach/Hydra based army. Watch out for Viper play, though!

If you are choosing to play the macro game, timing your third base is tricky. Dear warps in a lot of Zealots from his 4 Gateways before securing his third if he sees any amount of units on the map with his constant Phoenix scouting. If Dear doesn?t see any Roach/Ling force out on the map (as in game 3 of Dear vs Soulkey), then he will take it even before his first Colossus is started. As you take your third base, set up a Cannon defense surrounded by Pylons/Gateways to help with Zergling runbys as you tech up into the late game. Getting a Twilight Council to continue +2 Ground Weapons and Blink is a solid way to both deal with tech switches and set you up for a 3 base attack. Be sure to spend your excess minerals on proxy Pylons and Zealot runbys to keep your opponent?s base count in check.

Tips

- Spend all of your early game chronoboost on your two Nexus to maximize Probe production.
- The exact FFE build order you use is up to your personal preference. Dear has performed this build after a Forge First FFE, Nexus First FFE, and a failed attempted Cannon Rush.
- If possible, hide the Stargate somewhere in your base that is less likely to be scouted by an Overlord.
- Chronoboost your Stargate to get out those Phoenix as quickly as possible to deny any Overlord scouting of your follow-up Robotics transition.
A main strength of this build is its versatility, but you can only be versatile if you have the necessary scouting information. Scouting your opponent?s tech path and army production with your Phoenix is crucial.
- If you spot your opponent playing very greedy, you can choose to warp-in all of your Zealots from your 4 Gateways aggressively and hit a +1 Zealot/Phoenix timing while continuing the build at home.
- Chronoboost your Robotics Facility to get out your Colossus as quickly as possible and set up a solid midgame army.

Pros and Cons

This build is an incredibly versatile build that can be used as a macro opener or a 2 base all-in. It gets out early Phoenix for scouting and map control while transitioning into a solid ground based Colossus midgame.

However, this build requires a lot of APM and focus in order to execute.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Duckdeok 3gate Robo', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a 3 Stalker Rush to take map control, and follows up with a 1base 3gate Robo in order to pressure you opponent, get detection, and play safe against Blink/Stargate builds. This pressure build produces somewhat stable macro games if you react appropriately to your scouting information.

Scouting

For all early game scouting, please refer to the Scouting section of the 3 Stalker Rush build.

After your initial units have scouted around your side of the map, the majority of your scouting will come from your 3gate pressure at your opponents base.

- If your opponent is fast expanding, then attempt to cancel the Nexus before it finishes. Warp in more units at your proxy Pylon for extra pressure.
- If your opponent has just as many (or almost as many) Gateway units as you, immediately fall back and begin Immortal production. Against either Gateway attacks or Blink All-ins, you need a high Immortal count in order to defend.
- If your opponent does not have as many Gateway units as you, then push up the ramp and attempt to kill his army. Do NOT over-commit once your opponent has activated Photon Overcharge. If you cannot push up his ramp, then warp-in a Sentry or two at his natural and set up a contain while you expand back at home. If during the contain a Stargate unit flies into your base, be sure to activate your Photon Overcharge in order to keep your Probes alive.

Transitions

Once you have set up or a contain or you are forced to retreat back home, be sure to setup your natural expansion. Going into the macro game, however, the actual unit composition of your army very often depends completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with.  If your opponent stays on one base for too long, then throw down more Gateways, constantly make units, and prepare to defend your natural with Stalkers, Immortals, and your Planetary Nexus. In Robotics vs Stargate macro games, quickly switch into Blink or double Stargate play of your own so as to not lose against any Void Ray based armies. In Robotics vs Robotics macro games, Immortal count and/or Colossus count are the most important things. Keep tabs on your opponents tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Robotics vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponents potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by producing Immortals+Gateway units or Colossus for defense.

Tips

- Split your initial chronoboost on Probes and Warpgate Research in the early game so that you are not economically behind but still have a quick Warpgate attack.
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial 3 Stalkers to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Traps 3gate All-in).
- Against fast tech plays, your initial 3gate pressure should give you information on both the type and timing of your opponents attack. Be sure not to over-commit your Stalkers here, however, for Blink or Immortal all-ins will be able to hold your attack and counter-attack with a lot of force if you are careless with your initial units.
- Against Blink play (or your opponent has a lot of Stalkers when you pressure), be sure to pull back immediately and start Immortal production.
- Against Stargate play, use your Photon Overcharge to push back any Oracles or Phoenix if your Stalker army is out of position.
- Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very versatile, safe build that takes advantage of early Gateway units to apply pressure as well as defend every sort of all-in that can hit you. It also gets detection and Immortals for defense against ground-based all-ins, so very often you have a more stable opening than most other PvP builds.

However, this build forces you to be active on the map with your initial units.

This 1gate FE follows up with a 6gate, 2 base Blink Stalker attack, using the Mothership Core for high ground vision and Time Warp.

Benchmark: When Blink finishes (@7:40ish), you should have with 6 Stalkers and 36 Probes at home.

Attack your opponents natural/main with your first full warp-in from all 6 Gateways (@8:30ish) with 12 Blink Stalkers and constant Stalker reinforcements.

Scouting

This build is an aggressive opener that makes a lot of units, so you will not have to worry about Probe scouting. Against Reaper play, keep your first Stalker on a common hop-up ledge in order to deny your opponent scouting the Twilight Council. Against other defensive play, poke out to your opponents front with your first Stalker and check to see whether your opponent is going for Widow Mines or a quick CC into Bio so you know how to micro when you Blink into his main base with all of your units.

Transitions

This build is a strong 2 base Blink Timing that commits a lots of resources to Stalkers and no resources to upgrades or tech, so your follow-up will be quite slow. If your attack does damage and you keep most of your units alive, then you can start 2 more Assimilators, 2 Forges, and a Templar Archives, in order to transition into a Chargelot/Storm unit composition with Blink Stalkers to help deal with drops. However, if you do not deal some damage with your initial Stalkers, then you will be behind both economically and in tech against an opponent who will have Stimpack and Medivacs soon to follow.

Tips

- Do not bother Probe scouting early on because you can do this build against nearly everything your opponent chooses to open with.
- With your initial Stalkers, either protect your main base from a Reaper scouting your Twilight Council or move out and poke up at your opponents base for some early scouting intel.
- The limiting factor with this build is Blink Researchs build time and finishing your 6 Gateways, so be sure to Chronoboost Blink Research constantly in order to attack as soon as possible.
- Keep your Mothership Core out of harms way.  Use its 14 sight range for high ground vision, but do not commit the Mothership Core in the attack because without high ground vision, your attack will most likely fail.
- Do not forget to use your Mothership Cores Time Warp ability to help pick off SCVs or Bio units that are out of position.
- Do NOT over-commit your Stalkers in a risky blink. Only aggressively blink to get up to a high ground or to pick off a Siege Tank/Widow Mine before it activates.
- Constantly warping-in more Stalkers to reinforce your army and add strength to the attack is key to crushing through your opponents defenses.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong build because of how quickly you get both high ground vision with your Mothership Core and enough Blink Stalkers to do real damage  after opening with a 1gate FE. While your opponent might have Stimpack done in time for the attack, you can still beat your opponent in the open field if you use Time Warp and Blink appropriately.

However, this build commits a lot of resources to the attack, so transitioning into standard play will be much further behind if you had just rushed for High Templars and upgrades.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'HuK 5gate Warp Prism Attack', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with 2 Stalkers and a Mothership Core to take map control, and then follows up with a Warp Prism and 5 Gateways to drop the main of your opponent and force field him out of his own base.

Benchmark: When your Warp Prism finishes (@7:05ish), you should have around 32 Probes, 2 Stalkers, 4 Sentries, 1 Warp Prism, and a Mothership Core.

Scouting

This build is most effective against gasless openers from Terran, and quite ineffective against 1 base plays. Thus, be sure that you confirm your opponent doing a Reaper FE, CC First, or 1rax FE build with either your Probe scout at 13 supply or with your initial Stalker poke. If your opponent has not opened with an expansion, then abandon the Warp Prism and go instead for 2 more Assimilators, a Robotics Bay, double Forge, and standard macro PvT play. If your opponent has opened with an expansion, then proceed with this build and be sure to force field your opponent out of his main base.

Transitions

This build is a strong, 5 gate attack off of 2 bases with only 2 Assimilators.  Thus, you have to damage with this attack if you want to go into the midgame with an advantage. Assuming you do no damage and you lose the Warp Prism, you will have a very hard time coming back in the game, and should play stupidly greedy if you want a chance to come back. If you do some damage with this build but eventually lose everything, then you might still be in the game; transition by getting both Assimilators at your natural and go into a standard Colossi/Forge midgame. If you do a lot of damage and save some of your army with the Warp Prism, then you can feel free to take a greedy third base instantly while transitioning directly into Colossi+upgrades off of double Forge.

Tips

- Use your initial Stalkers and Mothership Core for map control and early game scouting. Only build the Warp Prism if you are playing against an expanding Terran. Get your naturals Assimilators and go into Colossi if you see your opponent staying on one base.
- Against Reaper play, keep at least one Stalker at home in order to defend your Probes and/or stop him from seeing your Warp Prism.
- When you finish your Warp Prism, load up your 4 Sentries instantly and head directly for your opponents main base.
- Poke your opponents front with your Stalkers before you go into the main with your Warp Prism to make sure that your opponent has all his units at his natural.
- Drop your Sentries on the high ground near your opponents ramp to instantly force field him out.
- Transform your Warp Prism into Phasing Mode and constantly warp-in 5 units at a time, favoring Zealots and Sentries.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with your Stalkers/Mothership Core to easily defend Reapers as well as take map control. Then, with the scouting intel that your Probe and Stalker poke give you, you follow up with a very early Warp Prism and 5 gate attack in order to drop in your opponents main while you force field him out. Against a non-expand build, you have the Robotics Facility and can get Observers or Immortals to play safe.

However, opening with this build delays your midgame tech by a lot. By only staying on 2 Assimilators, you do not have the gas income to go into Colossi instantly, and thus have to rely on your Warp Prism doing damage to get a leg up on your opponent. Also, this build relies a lot on early game scouting in order to ensure that your opponent is going for a standard expansion into Bio play.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,MothershipCore,Stalker,Chronoboost,Probe,Nexus,Probe,RoboticsFacility,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Chronoboost,WarpPrism,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpInSentry,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInSentry,WarpInSentry,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:32:50 AM;

This build opens with a Gateway Expand and then transitions into light Gateway pressure in order to start the macro game with an economic advantage. Also, this build gets both a Stargate and a third base quite quickly for a Chargelot/Void Ray or pure Sky-toss unit composition in the late game.

Scouting

After the early game, be sure to scout for early Roaches from your opponent. If your opponent is performing an early 2 base all-in, then warp-in Sentries and make Void Rays from your Stargate instead of being aggressive with your initial 6 units. If your opponent has taken a third base or shows NO signs of aggression, then be sure to set up your proxy Pylon as soon as you can for the attack to hit before Zergling Speed can finish.

When you are attacking with your initial 6 units (2 Stalkers, 3 Zealots, and Mothership Core), your opponent must defend with whatever units he has. With this extra scouting information, be sure to react appropriately. If your opponent has opened with Roaches, then be sure to start Void Ray production earlier. If your opponent has opened without Zergling speed, then be sure to continue the 3gate attack, reinforcing with Zealots and Stargate units when you can. If your opponent has opened with Zergling speed, then be sure not to over-commit to the attack; rather, pull back and start your Stargate production appropriately. Also note that if you kill a Queen or two, you should reinforce with an Oracle first due to your opponent?s lack of anti-air.

Depending on how your attack has gone (especially if your opponent defended with opening fast Roaches), then you might not feel safe to take such a quick third Nexus. Instead, start a Forge and a few Cannons at your natural in order to play safe.

Transitions

This build is a macro build, so don?t commit multiple warp-ins to the initial 3gate attack unless you are confident in its success. Following up with the appropriate Stargate units and taking your 3rd Nexus/extra Assimilators is much more important than dealing a killing blow with these units.

HerO follows up this attack with a Forge and several Cannons at both his natural expansion and 3rd Nexus. He then starts 2 more Stargates and both Assimilators at his 3rd Nexus in order to make a mass Void Ray army. With his economic advantage, he ensures that no standard Roach/Hydra timing attacks can kill his Sky-toss army until it is already too powerful.

However, it is also possible to play with an sOs style transition, favoring mass Chargelot and only several Void Rays in order to make a beefier ground army.  Again, start a Forge (or two) for Cannons at the natural expansion and 3rd Nexus as well as for Ground Upgrades. Then start at least 4 Gateways for a healthy Gateway count and a Twilight Council to begin Zealot Charge before taking your 5th and 6th Assimilators at your 3rd Nexus.  Add in High Templar/Archons instead of more Void Rays as your gas count allows it.

Tips

- Because this is a macro build with only light pressure, commit almost all of your chronoboost on both your Nexus throughout the build.
- With your initial Stalkers, be sure to clear any stray Zerglings around your base that might scout your build. Then defend the building proxy Pylon until your first warp-in.
- As soon as you start your Stargate, you need to send out a Probe in order to set up an aggressive proxy Pylon
- During your 3gate attack, use your Stalkers to target-fire any Queens your opponent might use to defend with. If you can kill a Queen or two, then follow-up with an Oracle to deal a lot of damage. Also, be sure to use Time Warp on any Queens or Roaches so as to minimize your opponent?s mobility in the fight.
- Do NOT over-commit multiple warp-ins to the 3gate attack unless you are confident that you can do damage. Each warp-in that you use slows down your 3rd Nexus timing by at least 20 seconds.
- If your opponent defends with fast Roaches, then consider starting a Forge and several Cannons at your natural expansion before you take the 3rd Nexus.

Pros and Cons

This macro build is strong because it opens with some light aggression for harassment and scouting, while taking a rather quick 3rd Nexus behind it. Also, it is a safe Gateway Expand build because your 3gates and Stargate together are enough to defend most early Zerg all-ins. Finally, this build uses a Stargate for some decent harassment, a deterrent for Mutalisks, and an opening for a strong unit-composition in the midgame.

However, this build requires solid macro while simultaneously performing a timing attack, so may be quite hard for newer players. Also, this build is somewhat weak against a Zerg who takes minimal losses during the 3gate attack and is able to follow-up with a +1/+1 mass Speedling attack to kill your 3rd Nexus.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Nexus,MothershipCore,WarpgateUpgrade,Pylon,Stalker,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Stalker,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Stargate,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Phoenix,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,VoidRay,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Nexus', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:32:50 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Hwangsin Stargate Expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with 5 Stalkers to apply pressure to your opponent and scout for what theyre opening.  It then follows up with a Stargate Expand, allowing you to reactively counter your opponents opening tech.

Benchmark: When you Stargate finishes (@6:30ish), you should have 24 Probes, 5 Stalkers, and a Mothership Core.

Scouting

Because of how low on minerals you are, you cannot afford to Probe scout.Thus, all of your scouting comes from your Stalkers.

Being active with your initial 3 Stalkers around your natural, third, and watchtower will prevent your opponent from sneaking proxy Pylons past you and hitting you with a very fast Gateway unit attack. Also, with your mobile army, you can head directly at your opponent in order to scout what units they have made and even attack them if they are attempting to expand quickly.  Your 5 Stalkers (with high ground vision from your Mothership Core) must scout what your opponent is doing, so that you can react accordingly with your Stargate in the midgame.

- If your opponent is fast expanding, then produce an Oracle from your Stargate and attempt to pressure the front with your Stalkers as your Oracle does damage in the main.
- If your opponent has multiple Sentries out, then attempt to bust up the ramp with your Stalkers to force him to use Force Fields to defend his ramp. The most likely scenario is that your opponent is making a Robotics Facility behind their Sentry count. However, it is also possible that your opponent is making a Stargate instead.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then make an Oracle or two and keep them in their base by threatening to kill multiple workers if they leave.
- If your opponent has a Stargate of their own, make constant Phoenix and position your units very defensively to deal with early Oracles.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then make one Oracle to stay defensive with in case of DTs. Afterwards, you can make up to 3-4 Phoenix for map control and harass potential, but quickly transition into Void Ray/Immortal to stay safe against Blink play.

Transitions

This build transitions into a macro game very easily. However, the actual unit composition of that macro game very often depends completely on what build your opponent has chosen to open with. If your opponent stays on one base for too long, then throw down more Gateways, constantly make units, and prepare to defend your natural with Void Rays, Stalkers, (possibly Immortals), and your Planetary Nexus. In Stargate vs Stargate macro games, quickly go up to 2 Stargates constantly making Phoenix and get a Fleet Beacon for the Phoenix Range upgrade. In Stargate vs Robotics macro games, use your Phoenix or Oracles to get an economic advantage, while transitioning into Sky-toss or a Phoenix/Blink all-in. In Stargate vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponents potential Blink or Dark Templar harass, as you transition to Void Ray/Immortal for defense or pure Sky-toss.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very safe build that gets quick map control with 5 Stalkers early on for safety, aggression, and scouting. With accurate scouting information, it then transitions into Stargate play and expands so that you can play a reactive macro game with a strong economy.

When you are out on the map with your first Stalkers, however, your opponent might sneak an Oracle into your main base. Be careful that you are only aggressive when you can be aggressive and only use your Stalkers for scouting when you cannot be aggressive. Finally, this build requires a LOT of scouting information to be executed well.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,GasProbe,GasProbe,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Pylon,Stalker,Stalker,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,Probe,Stalker,Probe,Stargate,Probe,Pylon,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon,Probe,Oracle,Probe', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:32:50 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Harstem 1 gate FE to Blink-Colossus', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a 1gate FE, and transitions directly into both Blink and Colossi. With these two tools you can safely secure your main and natural from both frontal pushes and backdoor drops.

Benchmark: When your first Colossus finishes (@9:00ish), you should have 1 Colossus, 3 Stalkers, a Sentry, a Mothership Core, 2 Observers, and around 50 Probes.

Scouting

This build is a safe build that gets detection and a lot of early game Stalkers, so Probe scouting is unnecessary. Use your initial Stalkers to ward off any of your opponents Reaper(s) or scout the front of your opponents base if they are opening with a Command Center First.

Most of your scouting will come from your 2 Observers. Send the first directly to your opponents main in order to spot what infrastructure is being built. Send the second to a common attack or drop path so that you have vision of when your opponent is moving out.

Against early Widow Mine drops, position your units defensively and consider delaying Colossus production in favor of more Observers.

Transitions

With Blink, Colossus, and Observers, you should be able to safely secure your main and natural expansions. Against bio play, consider getting 4 or 5 more Gateways while continuing your upgrades and taking your 3rd base as soon as you are safe to.

Alternatively, you are also able to go for a 2 Base, +2 Blink Stalker/Colossus all-in with this build.  Simply get your Ground Weapons upgrades instead of Ground Armor, and throw down 7 more Gateways after you start your Colossus production in order to break your opponent with simply Stalkers and Colossi.

Tips

- Chronoboost your Nexii constantly in order to get an economic advantage.
- Use your initial Stalker(s) to ward off any opposing Reapers and/or take a XelNaga Watchtower to see a push coming.
- Position your Robotics Facility, Forge, and Twilight Council in a central location to prevent them from being killed during a drop.
- Your Observers are the main way you can position your army to adequately defend multi-pronged aggression  replace them if they are scanned and lost.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with both Blink Stalkers and Colossi, rushing for all the tools you need to defend Terran aggression.  With strong upgrades and a mobile unit composition, this build allows you to enter the midgame ridiculously quickly.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Goswer 2 Base Roach-Ling All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This 2 base, Hatchery-tech Roach-Speedling all-in crushes through Void Ray-less Stargate or heavy Gateway Protoss openers, both out of a Gateway Expand or Forge Fast Expand.

Scouting

Send your first Overlord to scout your opponent?s natural wall to spot for a Forge Fast Expand or Gateway Expand, and then send it to a safe area for a later 7:00 scout.  Consider using your 2nd Overlord to guard your natural expansion against Cannon Rushes. Your next Overlords can be placed around your opponent?s main or natural base as backup scouts or for vision of their 3rd base.
Use your initial Zerglings to scout around the map for Probes and proxy Pylons. Keep a Zergling outside his front to scout for any early pokes, and avoid any Stalkers or the Mothership Core whenever possible.
The majority of your scouting will come from the Roach/Ling all-in. Note whether or not your opponent has opened with a Stargate, Robotics Facility, or Gateway-heavy army, and react accordingly.

Transitions

This build is a 2 base Roach/Ling all-in off of only 27 Drones, so there is no well defined transition. That being said, if the attack is not going well, be sure to pull back and keep your units alive, instantly resume Droning, and attempt to secure a third base and 3rd Queen.  Going for Lair and Roach Speed or Hydralisks is probably your best way to defend the inevitable counter-attack, but you might be too far behind (based entirely on how much damage your all-in did) for it to be enough.

Tips

- Be active on the map with your initial few Zerglings in order to deny vision of the fact that you do not have a 3rd Hatchery (and especially that you have mined more than 100 gas just for Metabolic Boost).
- Roaches take up a lot of supply, so be sure to start several Overlords BEFORE you need to make the 8 Roaches.
- During the all-in, keeping up on your injects so that you have enough Speedling reinforcements could be the difference between a close game and an easy slaughter.

Pros and Cons

This is a very strong 2 base all-in that uses Roach/Ling to crush your opponent before the midgame has even started. It also requires little scouting and little APM to perform well, so it is a great build for newer players to perform as well.
However, if your opponent spots your lack of third base early on, they should have enough time to wall off their natural with Photon Cannons if they opened with a FFE or get out enough Sentries if they opened with a Gateway Expand.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'HyuN 12 Roach Opener', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This 12 Roach Rush is a timing attack designed to cripple a Terran economy, transitioning into a further all-in or macro play as needed.

Scouting

There is only minor scouting necessary with this build before you hit your opponent with your 12 Roaches. Simply ensure that your opponent is not cheesing you with an 8-8-8 opener or proxy 11/11 Rax.
Once you are committed in the attack, be on the look-out for signs that your opponent is going for a full-on macro play (3 Command Centers), some sort of Hellbat aggression (Armory), some sort of Banshee play (Techlabbed Starport), or normal Bio play (multiple Barracks). Your upcoming transition requires you to both do some damage and later handle any counter attack potential from your opponent without losing much yourself.

Transitions

Depending on what you are most comfortable with and what you scout your opponent doing, you can transition into a later all-in or macro play yourself. Note that regardless of whichever path you follow, you will have to do some amount of damage with your attack or you will be behind both in terms of economy and tech.
If you are transitioning into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk play, stop all Roach production, and get a Lair, Metabolic Boost, and 2 Evolution Chambers as soon as possible. Getting Mutalisks out to defend 3 bases from drops as you tech towards +2/+2 Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk with all the necessary upgrades is how you?ll get ahead in the midgame.
If you are transitioning into a Roach based midgame, try to avoid making many more Roaches after your initial 12 roach opener. Instead, focus on securing 3 Hatcheries, 2 Evolution Chambers, and teching for a Speed Roach/Speed Hydra midgame (with potentially Swarm Host/Viper lategame).
If you are transitioning into another all-in, your best best is some sort of Roach based army with splash damage (such as a Roach/Bane all-in). Do note that any follow-up all-in will be particularly weak against Banshee or Widow Mine defenses.

Tips

- As you get to your first 100 Gas, if there is still a scout in your main base, consider fake researching Metabolic Boost. Be sure to cancel if before you get to 28 supply and need to start your Roach Warren.
- Don?t over-commit to making Roaches. Only make 12 and then be sure you are getting the necessary 2 base economy, Overlord count, and creep spread back at home while your attack is commencing.
- The point of the attack is to cripple your opponent, but if the attack does not go too well, there is no retreat; your follow-up depends largely on your ability to scout what your opponent has opened with and react/defend accordingly.

Pros and Cons

This aggressive build can outright defeat opponents that are macroing too hard or do not scout and react adequately. Opening with 12 Roaches gives your early game a muscle that not many other ZvT builds give you, giving you great denial of any Reaper/Hellion openers as well.
However, this build does put you behind both in terms of economy and tech if your attack does not do damage. In order to equalize the game, you must do some sort of damage as well as drone up back at home to crush your opponent later in the game.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,RoachWarren,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:32:50 AM;

This macro build order opens with a quick 3 Hatchery opening to get a strong economy and then transitions into a Tech-heavy army in order to stay safe against early attacks and lay on the aggression to Protoss before the late game starts. This build maxes out on Roach/Hydra/Viper in order to crush your opponent?s army or deny their 3rd/4th base.

Scouting

Scout with either Overlords, Zerglings, Overseer, or Changelings when your Hydralisk Den goes down. Send them into either the main base or the 3rd base in order to see if Protoss is going for a tech-heavy composition (Colossus/Void Ray/etc) or a Chargelot-heavy composition. If they are going for a Chargelot heavy composition, instantly throw down a Banelings Nest, start Baneling Speed, and max out with around 16 Banelings in your unit composition.
Besides this, all mid and late game scouting comes from the Roach/Hydra/Viper pokes or attacks that you will perform. React appropriately by either re-maxing with Ultras or Swarm Hosts. You will need a 5th base to fully support any Hive-tech re-maxes.

Transitions

There is no ?transition? per se. If you can win the game with this push, then be sure to attack in an open position, use Blinding Cloud or Abduct appropriately, and take the game quickly. If you cannot win the game outright, then fall back on your 4/5 base economy and tech switch to whatever best counters your opponent?s army. Note that you should get a lot of static defense in order to stay safe during your super late game tech switches between Mutalisks, Swarm Hosts, and Ultralisks.

Tips

- If your first Overlord scouts your opponent going for a Gateway expand, then you should abandon getting the third base, instead getting an Extractor and starting Metabolic Boost before taking your 3rd.
- If your natural gets Pylon blocked, then you can make an early Overlord at 15 supply instead of the Hatchery in order to buy some time against it. If your opponent lets the Pylon finish, then simply making 4-6 Zerglings to take the Pylon down should be enough of a commitment before returning back to the build.
- Being thorough about checking for early proxy Pylons across the map with your early game Zerglings is crucial against early Protoss timings. Being able to spot aggression and stop it before it can even begin is the easiest way to avoid quick losses.
- Be sure you send in an Overlord scout at 7:00. Spotting your opponent?s midgame tech informs your next step with this build(whether it be more Drones, a Hydralisk Den, or Spore Crawlers).
- Vipers will be usable (Consume finishes) 3:30 after your Infestation Pit starts.
- Scouting for a heavy Chargelot composition before you max can be quite important. Throwing down a Banelings Nest and maxing with several Banelings can be the difference between a quick loss and a sure win.
- Once you have re-maxed on Ultras, starting a Spire and tech-switching between Mutalisks and Swarm Hosts/Ultras is a strong way to win in the very late game. Also note that you should get a lot of static defense when performing these late game tech switches.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a hugely economic opening while still being safe. It then transitions into a Viper-based defense in order to secure your 4th base and quickly max out on Roach/Hydra/Viper.
This build however requires constant scouting in order to be safe. Also, it is not great against Skytoss unless you scout it early because you might over-produce Roaches (which obviously cannot shoot up) when gearing up for a normal attack.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Queen,Zergling,Drone,Drone,Queen,Hatchery,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Queen,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Overlord,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,RoachWarren,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Overlord,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,EvolutionChamber,Extractor,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Lair,Overlord,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Hatchery,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,MissleAttacksLevel1,MetabolicBoost,Extractor,Extractor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Overlord,InfestationPit,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Queen,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Hatchery,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Hive,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GlialReconstitution,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,HydraliskDen,MissleAttacksLevel2,Extractor,Extractor,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,MuscularAugments,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Viper,Viper,Viper,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,BanelingNest,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:32:50 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'INnoVation 2 Base SCV Pull', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

Designed specifically to kill most Protoss players during the mid game Templar transition, INnoVations SCV pull hits at around 14 minutes with MMM, Vikings, SCVs, and 2/1 upgrades.

Scouting

The first ten minutes of the game is a standard TvP Reaper FE, so scouting and reactions proceed as normal.

First, SCV scout, 15 supply at the latest, to see if you are being 10 gate Zealot rushed. Then follow up with your Reaper scout, checking pylon count, assimilator count, gas mined, and MSC/Stalker/Nexus timing.

Your early Engineering Bay allows for equally early Missile Turrets, so you should be able to build a turret in your main base and position marines in your natural mineral line in the event of an Oracle attack.

Against a delayed Protoss expansion (4:10+, no Nexus), always build a bunker.

Against a fast expanding Protoss, poke with your first Marauder and 8-10 Marines to force overcharge and to gauge his army size.

This initial poke will reveal the following possibilities:

- Little to no Gateway units: Possible double forge (proceed as normal) or Dark Templars (build turrets and bank one scan minimum).
- No obvious Observers: Confirm Twilight tech. If your opponent is going for Templar instead of Colossus, immediately abandon the build and do a biomine parade style using a reactored Factory and five barracks before your third Command Center. SCV pulls are a poor choice against Pisonic Storm.
- More Stalkers then usual: Possible Blink Stalker aggression. React accordingly with bunkers and mines. Consider hiding your small poke squad at his third or fourth, and counter attacking when he moves all his stalkers and his MSC to your side of the map.
- Phoenixes: Phoenix Colossus is by far the most likely choice, but constantly scout to see if the Colossus count is rising. If it remains at one or two for very long, be cognizant of the possibility of a feint into Templars.
- Healthy Gateway unit count: Proceed as normal.

These above are only a few examples, but the most common. Against most styles that involve Colossus (single forge, double forge, blink colossus, phoenix colossus, etc) you will be able to simply play as normal and execute the all in without any problems.

For lower level players, please be advised all scouting reactions as written above are general assumptions made against players attempting optimal strategies. You will be blindsided by sub optimal and often illogical strategies quite often, but you should be able to compensate with superior macro and mechanics.

Transitions

As with any all-in, there is no transition unless you have done a significant amount of damage.

If your attack fails, there is no transition; you will die almost immediately to any counter attack, or you will be contained to two bases and slowly starve to death.

If your attack succeeds in mostly destroying Protosss army, but you cannot finish off your opponent, retreat and rally defensively. Continue your upgrades, maintain consistent worker production, and add a third command center and a Ghost Academy, if necessary.

Tips

The main objective of this push is to successfully engage and destroy his army decisively. Your SCVS are there to absorb just enough Colossus volleys to allow your Vikings to destroy all the AOE and your MMM to shoot through the Gateway buffer.

Again, to emphasize, your objective is to destroy his army decisively, not to destroy his third, or his natural, or snipe any tech. You are to take one crushing victory with your army before beginning to do any eco or tech damage.

During the actual engagement, be sure to have your SCVs in front of your main army. Attack in as wide of a concave as you can form, and make sure that your Vikings are shift A-clicked across his Colossus.

Do not attempt any drops or secondary attacks. Your attack needs to be as strong as possible along a single front for the highest chance of success.

Pros and Cons

The first ten minutes of this build, as mentioned above, are identical to a standard Reaper FE, making this a particularly tricky all in to scout. Additionally, this build has the benefit of blind countering some two base Colossus all-ins because it gets Vikings so quickly, and in such high numbers.

That being said, just as with any all-in, if scouted and identified, this build loses a lot of its potency. A faster than normal Templar transition and increased Sentries for force fields are both popular and effective responses against scouted SCV pulls.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,EngineeringBay,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,SCV,Barracks,SCV,DoubleMarines,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SCV,CallMule,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,TechLabOnBarracks,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,StimPack,Marauder,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,Factory,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marauder,CallMule,SCV,SCV,InfantryArmorLevel1,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Starport,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnFactory,DoubleMarines,Marauder,SCV,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SupplyDepot,Refinery,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,CombatShield,SupplyDepot,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMarines,CallMule,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,Armory,CallMule,Barracks,Barracks,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,ConcussiveShells,SCV,SCV,CallMule,TechLabOnBarracks,ReactorOnBarracks,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,InfantryWeaponsLevel2,SupplyDepot,CallMule,Marauder,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleVikings,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,Marauder,Starport,CallMule,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleVikings,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,CallMule,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Viking,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleVikings,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,CallMule,Marauder,Marauder,Viking,DoubleVikings', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:09 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'INnoVation Reactor Hellion 3CC', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This CC First build gets a ridiculously fast 3rd Command Center, taking your economy immediately into the midgame. Using Reactor Hellions for map control and scouting information, this build is also reasonably safe; your Hellions let you quickly react to any Zerg all-in and Widow Mines + 3 Orbitals provides a reasonable defense.

Scouting

Instead of worrying about early game Zerglings, Innovation just builds his Command Center on the high ground, and finishes a wall-off with the initial Barracks. Thus, Innovation does not scout at all until his first Hellions pop.  With these Reactor Hellions he takes map control, clears out any Zerglings at watchtowers, and pokes Zergs front to spot the Zergs third base, any buildings at the front, and any units that Zerg is making.

- If you see a ton of Speedlings, then make sure your Hellion micro is on point. Feel free to pull back behind your natural wall in order to more effectively deal with Speedlings.
- If you see Roaches, then immediately cut Reactor Hellion production and start making Widow Mines two at a time. Make a Marauder, and consider cutting SCVs in order to complete a wall-off at your natural and prevent your opponent from running past your Bunker/Widow Mines.
- If you see two Evolution Chambers, then assume your opponent is playing a macro game.
- Alternatively, if you see a third base, then you can also assume your opponent is playing a macro game.

After any early pressure is spotted or not spotted, lift off your third Command Center and take your third. Use your Hellions and Marines (now with Stim) to secure it. All mid-game scouting will come from your incoming push with your first Medivacs.

Transitions

This build transitions well into both Marine/Tank or Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine because it sets up the basic infrastructure needed for either of those and gets Stim, +1/+1, and Combat Shields. Its infeasible to transition into Mech because of how much infrastructure and time you have already committed to into Bio upgrades.

For either transition, secure your third base, take both Refineries at your third, start +2/+2, and produce a lot of Marines. When transitioning into Marine/Tank, start a Tech lab on your Factory as well as a second Factory to kick start your Siege Tank count. When transitioning into Bio/Widow Mine, produce a Reactor on your Factory and start cranking out Widow Mines as you abuse your mobile Marine/Medivac force to apply pressure to your opponent. A +2/+2 timing attack with several Siege Tanks or several Widow Mines, and a lot of Marines is a very strong timing to hit.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a ridiculously economic opener  CC First into 3 CC.  However, this build gets Reactored Hellions quite quickly in order to take map control as well as stay safe against early Speedling timings. Also, your Hellions are quite useful in terms of the scouting information they give you.

However, this build is somewhat weak to early Roaches. Also, you can only apply very light pressure to your opponent with your initial 6 Hellions  all other harass will have to come later once Medivacs are out.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Bunker,Marine,CallMule,SCV,Factory,CallMule,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,SCV,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,SCV,StimPack,Marine,CallMule,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SCV,EngineeringBay,EngineeringBay,DoubleHellions,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,SCV,SCV,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,InfantryArmorLevel1,Marine,LiftFactoryFromReactor,ReactorOnFactory,Barracks,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SupplyDepot,CallMule,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,LandRaxOnReactor,DoubleMarines,SCV,LandRaxOnReactor,DoubleMarines,Marine,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Armory,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marine,CombatShield,CallMule,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SCV,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marine,ReactorOnFactory,ReactorOnBarracks,TechLabOnBarracks,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SCV', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:09 AM;

Then it follows up with a quick 3rd Command Center to get a leg up against a macro-oriented Protoss opponent.

Scouting

This macro build is a greedy build, so scouting for all-ins is important.  However, you cannot afford to (nor have any need to) scout with an SCV before 17 supply. When you get to your opponents base, check whether they have a natural expansion started at or before the 5 minute mark. If your opponent has not started a Nexus by around the 5 minute mark, and they have both gas geysers, then you can assume they are performing an all-in with either a Twilight Council or Stargate. Be prepared to delay your 3rd Command Center in favor of 2 more Bunkers at the front (or main if your opponent appears to be doing a Blink all-in) and/or a Turret per mineral line to deal with Oracles.

All of the midgame scouting will come from you pushing out and taking the middle watchtowers, attacking the front, and dropping the main once you have Medivacs out. Simply noticing what units and unit composition your opponent is using to defend should give you enough information about their midgame plans to make informed counters.

Transitions

Because of how much infrastructure and time has been spent on Bio play in this build, the only possible follow up is going for more Bio play and adding in Vikings+Ghosts (and Hellbats or Widow Mines for the late game) as you take more bases.

To transition into standard Bio play, get another Engineering Bay and an Armory to continue double upgrades, add-on a Reactor and Tech lab onto your 4th/5th Barracks, get all of your third bases Refineries, and throw down either a Ghost Academy or a 2nd Starport depending on whether your opponent is going for Colossi or High Templar.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong build because of the powerful economy you kick start with your initial CC First and quick third. Also, by avoiding early Widow Mine drops or harassing units and focusing completely on getting upgrades and Bio, your army is considerably stronger at the 10 minute mark than most other TvP builds. Finally, this build is strong because you get a fast Engineering Bay and excess minerals, and thus have the opportunity to throw down Bunkers/Turrets to deal with any sort of 1 base aggression that a Protoss player can throw at you.

However, this build is only safe if your scouting is effective. Misjudging that your opponent is going for a macro game instead of an all-in can cost you the game instantly. Also, there is no opportunity with this build to apply pressure before you finish Stim and Medivacs at the 10 minute mark because it is focused on economy instead of pressure.

Tips

- The main strength of this build is the economic advantage. Do NOT miss SCVs as you are taking bases and macroing up.
- You cannot afford to scout before 17 supply in order to afford the CC and Barracks on time, but scouting what your opponent is doing in the early game is crucial, so be sure to send an SCV to scout soon after you reach 17 supply.
- Build another Bunker or two at the front if a scan or your SCV scout finds that your opponent has not started an expansion around the 5 minute mark.
- If you are playing completely blind, build a Missile Turret in each mineral line to defend against the possibility of Oracles before they could possibly arrive.
- Once you have Stimpack and Medivacs, push out instantly to try and deny a third base from your opponent and/or get scouting information about what midgame tech choice your opponent is committing to. However, keep in mind that you are on 3 Orbitals, and so remember that your economy is far ahead, but your army supply is not.

This all-in hits your opponent?s main with a lot of speed Roaches. However, Jaedong puts his own clever flair on this traditional ZvT All-in by using an Overlord Roach Drop to guarantee his Nydus follow-up is successful.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of very early force, position your Queens to defend your natural and consider getting a Spine Crawler. Banshee play may be an issue with only 2 Queens, but such a fast Lair means you will have a very quick Overseer.
The next scout will be with your initial Roach Warren attack. Terran will be forced to defend his main with all his units, so you?ll see either Bio or Mech units to defend. These Roaches should be able to scout and do some serious economic damage ? hopefully enough to end the game with constant reinforcements from the Nydus Network.

Transitions

This build is a 2 base all-in that gets a lot of attacking units and very few Drones as well as upgrades that do not lend themselves towards the mid or late game. Therefore, there is no well-defined follow-up for the build, should your attack fail. However, if you do a lot of damage with the attack but lose your Nydus Network, be sure to follow-up with a 3rd Hatchery, a lot more Drones, and 2 Evolution Chambers to try to transition into normal play.

Tips

- Against a Reaper/Hellion player, save your Queen energy after you start 2 or 3 Creep Tumors. Having energy for Transfuse lets you push back any early attacks without revealing your Roaches.
- Hide your Roaches for as long as possible before you move out. The less time you give your opponent to react to your build, the better your chance at crushing through their front.
- Make 2 Overlords per inject cycle ? 8 Roaches takes up 16 supply.
- Bring an Overseer or two with your Roach attack so that you have detection against Widow Mines. Remember to split your Roaches to avoid splash damage from either Widow Mines or Siege Tanks.
- This attack is an all-in, so you have to kill your opponent with this attack. Don?t let your Roaches mess around attacking buildings or SCVs ? kill your opponent?s army as soon as possible.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any player going for a fast 3 Command Center build (the current metagame) because of how late their upgrades and army will be. Also, any build that gets both Roach drops AND Nydus Networks is a very fun all-in to play with.
However, this is an all-in, so if you cannot do game-ending damage with the Roach attack, you will be economically behind the Terran opponent.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,MetabolicBoost,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Overlord,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Lair,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,RoachWarren,Drone,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,VentralSacs,Overlord,Overlord,GlialReconstitution,PneumatizedCarapace,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,NydusNetwork,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,NydusWorm', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:09 AM;

Invented by Flash but refined and popularized by INnoVation, this Reaper/Hellion 3CC variant is by far the most popular on ladder and is considered by the majority of Terran players to be the most standard of macro builds. Its versatility has stood the test of time, and the current version below will be continually updated as INnoVation continues to optimize it again and again.

Scouting

You can open with this build regardless of what your opponent is doing, so SCV scouting is unnecessary. You only need to SCV scout if you want to confirm that your opponent is opening Hatchery First and want to start a Bunker at their natural in order to begin Reaper/Bunker pressure.

The rest of your scouting will come from your Reapers and then later Reaper+Hellions poking the front and forcing your opponent to reveal what units they have in order to defend your attacks. Note: Ling Speed will finish around 3 minutes after your opponent takes an Extractor. Thus, if your initial SCV/Reapers see your opponent taking gas, be sure to send your Reapers back just before those 3 minutes are up and wait for some Hellions before attempting to engage Speedlings in the open field.

In case your Reapers or Hellions spot your opponent making Roaches or going for a Roach Warren, immediately cancel your next pair of Hellions and begin making Widow Mines and Marauders. Having your Widow Mines positioned effectively, and using SCVs to tank damage or repair your Bunker will be all you need to stay alive.

Be prepared to throw the timings of the second half of this build out assuming any serious aggression, such as a Roach Bane all-in.

Transitions

This build transitions well into both Marine/Tank or Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine because it sets up the basic infrastructure needed for either of those and gets Stimpack.

The above transition involving double barracks after hellions followed by double ebay is the standard transition. In the event of an extreme all in, such as Roach bane, immediately begin marauder, mine, and bunker production. Against a strong Roach timing it is advised to begin tank production while slightly delaying either your Starport or Engineering Bays; this is most demonstrated notably in INnoVations series against Hyun in the WCS 2014 Global Finals.

Another great transition if you have done some damage with your Reapers or Hellions is going for a Hellbat/Marauder follow-up attack. How Dragon does this is throw down an Armory as soon as you start your 3rd Command Center, and then make Hellbats constantly as soon as the Armory finishes.  Starting two Engineering Bays and going for a +1/+1 Marauder/Hellbat push is a great way to keep up the aggression against your Zerg opponent. Keep in mind that this sort of 3CC Hellbat aggression is far weaker than a two base committed Hellbat push.

Pros and Cons

This build was originally intended as an aggressive opener backed by strong macro. In modern TvZ, however, any competent Zerg player will easily deflect Reaper Hellion pressure with minimal losses, and gasless three hatches are becoming increasingly rare due to the benefits provided by opening either Speedlings or Roach aggression. As such, the major pro of this build should now be listed as the amount of information that the Reaper can provide; because Zerg cannot proxy any tech, you should be aware of what Zerg is doing most of the time. In this way, opening Reaper/Hellion is inordinately safer than simply opening Hellions, if only because of the information difference.

The weakness of this build traditionally had been hyper aggressive openers, such as fast Speedling rushes (which can be deterred by bunkers between your 2nd CC and your main ramp), Roach/Bane busts (which can be held with bunkers, repair, and either mines or hellions with Marauders), or even fast Muta play (which INnoVation countered by simply pushing at his normal time with three missile turrets at home).

The new biggest threat against this build, however, is Roach timings. Simply put, this build focuses very heavily on Hellion production, and delays all other AOE quite significantly (usually up until around 11+ minutes). As such, 1-1 Roach Busts, or fast 2-2 Roach Hydra max out attacks, or even Roach Hydra into Brood Lords are all excellent examples of builds in which players should quickly identify, cut Hellions, and immediately begin adapting their builds for the situation.

Learning this Build and the Difficulty Curve

This build is undoubtedly one of the hardest macro builds to learn in the game. Besides its extreme adherence to timings and linear sequences, it is also extremely punishing in every aspect; INnoVation has refined this build to the point of impracticability; over queueing means delaying Hellions; delaying Hellions delays your Barracks, delaying your Barracks delays your starport, and delaying your starport delays your entire 1-1 push. In short, a single mistake has many more long lasting impacts as opposed to a standard Terran build.

To go about learning this build, it is important to work on only one section at a time and to not try to do everything at once when you first start off, else you will immediately fail.

In the order of things to focus on (#1 being top priority, and #8 being the lowest priority)

1. Worker Production
2. Not getting supply blocked, not over queueing, and proper rallies for all structures
3. The build itself (for example, starting Hellions before 5:30, or double E-bay and 2nd gas geyser at 7:40) and its relevant timings
4. Taking your Third base on time
5. Scouting
6. Keeping your Reaper Hellion alive
7. Harassing
8. Micro (Sniping the first creep tumor, catching the transfer of drones to the third base, weakening Queens to force transfuses and decrease tumors, sniping active tumors, runbys, etc.)

In short, always defer to the priorities, and only move down the line as you can accomplish the others. Even if you kill 32 Zerglings with your Hellions, it is irrelevant if you Medivacs finish at 12 minutes instead of 10:20. Even if you land your third base at 8:30, it is irrelevant if you only have 26 SCVs at the time instead of 40-50 that INnoVation might have. And even if you plant every structure down perfectly at the allotted times, supply blocks, over queueing, poor rallies, and suboptimal worker distribution also grind this entire build to a screeching halt.

Focus on one step at a time, and continually re watch INnoVations replays of this build from his view to fully internalize the mechanics and decisions that make this build brilliant.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,Reaper,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,CommandCenter,GasScv,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Factory,SCV,SCV,CallMule,CommandCenter,SCV,LiftRaxFromReactor,OrbitalCommand,LandFactoryOnReactor,Marine,SCV,DoubleHellions,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleHellions,StimPack,Marine,SCV,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,DoubleHellions,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnFactory,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,EngineeringBay,EngineeringBay,Refinery,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Marine,SCV,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,InfantryArmorLevel1,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,SCV,SCV,SCV,LandRaxOnReactor,LandRaxOnReactor,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Refinery,Refinery,ReactorOnFactory,Starport,SCV,SCV,SCV,CallMule,CallMule,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,ConcussiveShells,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,Armory,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Refinery', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:09 AM;

This build opens with a 9 Pool in order to apply a lot of early pressure to your opponent and keep them on one base, and then transitions into more macro oriented play with a Speedling follow-up.

Scouting

All of your scouting comes from your initial Overlords and your 10 Zerglings.  First scout where your opponent has spawned by sending your Overlord directly to one of the possible bases. Then use your first 6 Zerglings (with more rallied) to poke/prod your opponent?s base.
If you see your opponent?s natural Hatchery nearly done, then they have performed a Hatchery First opener and you can choose either to ignore the natural and attack their workers in the main or to focus exclusively on the natural and plan to bring it down. Note that you MUST do economic damage one way or another with your 10 Zerglings or you will fall behind economically.
If your opponent?s natural Hatchery is only just started, then they have performed a Pool First opener. Focus on canceling the natural Hatchery ? you won?t be able to do much damage in the main before their Spawning Pool finishes.
If your opponent does not have a natural, then go up into the main and check their gas count. Prepare against 1 base play of either Banelings or Roaches by focusing much more on Speedlings and potentially getting a Spine Crawler.

Transitions

You can use this opener to transition into any form of Zerg play. If you want to end the game immediately, you can put Drones back on gas and go for a 1 base Ling/Bane all-in.
More standard play ensues by starting your natural expansion as soon as possible and making only as many Speedlings as needed to be safe and have map control. For a Roach midgame, start a Roach Warren and Lair after your first 100 gas. Then, on 3 gasses, you can start Roach Speed and +1 Attack. For a Mutalisk midgame, get a Lair with your first 100 gas and saturate your 2 bases and 4 gasses as soon as possible. Start your Spire as soon as your Lair finishes.

Tips

- Attack his Drones in his main if he has performed a Hatchery First opener
- Attack his natural expansion if he has gone for a Pool First opener
- Scout his main if he has gone for a 1 base build
- Do NOT make too many Zerglings. It may seem tempting to try and kill your opponent with constant reinforcements, but slow Zerglings lose their effectiveness very quickly. Drones are much more important.
- Be sure to pull off of gas once you have mined 100 for Metabolic Boost. You need all of your Drones mining minerals in order to boost your economy into the midgame.

Pros and Cons

This build opens up with a 9 Pool in order to situate aggressively in a matchup known for its early game volatility. It also gets Metabolic Boost at a standard time, while still allowing for both macro or all-in transitions.
However, this build is obviously a lot less economical than most other ZvZ builds, so you must do some sort of economic damage with your initial 10 Zerglings or risk falling behind.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,CancelExtractor,Drone,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Queen,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,MetabolicBoost,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Overlord,InjectLarva', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:09 AM;

This build opens with fast upgrades and mass Speedlings to crush any midgame attacks. It then transitions into a strong 3 base Ultralisk timing to either cripple the Protoss opponent or outright win the game.

Scouting

Scout first with your 2 initial Zerglings, use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of the Protoss base depending on the map.   Check to see whether your opponent is Gateway expanding or Forge expanding. Be wary of early pressure if your opponent is Gateway expanding.
With your 7:00 overlord scout, consider adding a Baneling Nest if you are up against a Gateway timing. Make mass Speedlings to defend any 2 base ground plays or ramp up Queen production early to defend any 2 base air plays.
Against a 2 base Colossus push, consider adding a Spire for Corruptors if you need more defense. Also, regardless of whether or not you need to make Corruptors for defense, you should start Air upgrades in case of a Mutalisk switch after you have maxed out with your Ultralisk army.
Ideally, your Ultras should be out with +5/+3 around 15:50. Commit to an attack as soon as possible when these upgrades finish.  If you have yet to take a 4th base and Spire or Hydralisk Den by this stage in the game, get them now.

Transitions

There is no ?transition? per se.  If you can win the game with this push, then be sure to attack in an open position and take the game quickly. If you cannot win the game outright, then fall back on your 4 base economy and tech switch to whatever best counters your opponent?s army.

Tips

Against Pylon blocks

- If you want to try and guarantee the Hatchery being placed, send a Drone to your natural around 11/12 supply and hide it there. This might trick Protoss into thinking that you are going Pool first.  Note that this will not work every time, and it also will not stop a Protoss dedicated to Pylon blocking you.
- A 15 Pool/15 Hatch/15 Gas opener (or at worst ? if they fail to cancel the Pylon ? a 15 Pool/15 Gas/and Hatchery as soon as you can) will be fine in this case. The most important thing is starting your Extractor on time, not the natural Hatchery.
- Be sure to make 4-6 Zerglings to take the pylon down if you need to, and go up to 3 Queens as soon as you can ? just like normal.
- Once you place your Extractor, the first 100 gas goes to Metabolic Boost, and place your Evolution Chambers when you get to 175 gas like normal to transition back into the build.

The Engagement

- Bring your Queens to transfuse, and any optional Infestors or Banelings you made to force good engagements.
- Do NOT engage into a Protoss wall. You want to engage in as open an area as you possibly can for your melee army to do maximum damage.
- Do NOT engage without your queens in transfuse range unless you are sure you can take a strong fight. Strong creep spread with all of your Queens helps tremendously.
- Try to avoid Archons with your Zerglings; use the Ultralisks to tank those. Similarly, focus your Zerglings on Stalkers and Immortals; keep your Ultralisks away from those.
- If you use Ultralisks to crush any forcefields, Zerglings can actually deal with Colossi quite easily as they take minimal damage whilst underneath the Colossi.

Pros and Cons

This build is very strong against a ?standard? Protoss army of Gateway units, Colossi and some Stargate or Templar units. Also, this timing attack has the strong potential to end the game.
However, this build is somewhat simple for Protoss to scout and is vulnerable to timing attacks and all-ins when you only have upgraded Speedlings to defend. Also, if your Protoss opponent is positioned in a well defended location, the engage can be quite difficult to perform well.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Extractor,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Zergling,MetabolicBoost,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Queen,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,EvolutionChamber,EvolutionChamber,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,MeleeAttacksLevel1,GroundCarapaceLevel1,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,Lair,Overlord,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Overlord,Queen,InjectLarva,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,Extractor,Extractor,Queen,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Queen,Hatchery,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,MeleeAtacksLevel2,GroundCarapaceLevel2,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,Overlord,InfestationPit,SpawnCreepTumor,Queen,Queen,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Queen,Queen,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Hive,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Queen,Queen,Overlord,Overlord,Extractor,Extractor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Infestor,Infestor,Infestor,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,AdrenalineGlands,UltraliskCavern,MeleeAttacksLevel3,GroundCarapaceLevel3,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Hatchery,ChitinousPlating,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:09 AM;

This build opens up with a quick 3 base economy to stay safe against any early Terran shenanigans as well as give you enough power to hit a strong Zergling/Baneling timing before your Terran opponent can get their 3 base economy rolling. One main strength of this build is that the timing push is not all-in, but rather a tool to get you safely to the familiar position of Mutalisks and 4 bases without having to deal with unrelenting Terran pressure.

Scouting

Note the 7:00 Overlord scout to check whether your opponent is going for Bio or Mech. Do not continue with this build order if your Overlord scout spots your opponent going for Mech.
If you scout a Reaper/Hellion/Banshee opener, keeping your Queens alive without Metabolic Boost is quite difficult. Instead of blindly rushing into this build, get a few Spine Crawlers and 1 Spore Crawler per mineral line with an extra Spore or two between the natural and 3rd Hatchery.  It is fine to commit a lot to defense in this situation as going Reaper/Hellion/Banshee slows down any Bio/Mine pushes considerably.
By the time you attack just after 11 minutes, you must know how Terran is going to defend. Run a Zergling or two at Terran?s wall where you want to bust through to spot what army composition is waiting.
- If you scout Bio/Mine, continue as normal with the initial bust.
- If you scout Marine/Tank, consider continuing the bust. However, if you see more than one Siege Tank, be sure to retreat and build your Spire/Creep/Hive!
- If you scout Mech this late, you have most likely already lost. Transitioning into Mutalisks or Swarm Hosts instantly may be enough to keep you alive, but know that you have committed a lot of resources to a bust that cannot succeed.

Transitions

Once you perform the bust, you will either outright win the game, do a little bit of economic damage and trade armies, or completely fail without doing any serious damage. In either of the first two cases, continue to deny the most recent Terran base (either an undefended 3rd, or a future 4th if their 3rd is well established), and continue to play the macro game. If your bust has completely failed, then you can attempt to play the macro game with your 5 Hatcheries already done, but note that you have committed and subsequently a lost of resources going into the macro game.
In a macro game, go up to Hive tech when you most prefer. Some Zergs delay it, some get it faster. Life is known for getting it for +3/+3 and faster Ultralisks. Eventually transitioning into Ultralisk/Queen/Infestor is a solid end-game unit composition ? just be sure that you have enough static defense to deny doom drops and stop Terran from spreading you too thin as you attempt to create this scary army.

Tips

- Against any early pressure, your Queens and a Spine Crawler are all the defense you will need.  With a later Metabolic Boost, you cannot rely on Speedlings to help defend any 1 base all-ins.
- Do your best to clear the map of any of your opponent?s Hellions BEFORE you are ready to bust. Being able to spawn your Banelings close to your opponent as opposed to back at your base makes this bust a lot more effective.
- Get an Overseer before the initial bust to help clear any Widow Mines. However, this build hits early enough that there should not be too many Widow Mines up just yet for you to worry about.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any player going for a Tank-less 3 Command Center build (the current metagame). Also, because you saturate your third base before moving out, it is quite easy to stop Zergling/Baneling production and transition into a macro game with a strong economic advantage.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'MacSed 5gate', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build is a fast expand build that opens with a Mothership Core for defense, and then follows-up with a very quick 5gate timing with Zealots and Sentries to crush your opponent before they can even enter their midgame tech.

Scouting

After the early game, scouting is much more minimal than you might expect. As long as you can confirm your opponent is getting a third Hatchery (and sometimes even if they are not getting one), you should be able to go through with this build.

With your attack, you will be able to scout what units he is using to defend. If you are fighting mass Speedling, then constantly warp-in Zealots and Sentries.  If you are fighting Roaches, then constantly warp-in Stalkers. Your opponent should not be able to get out either Hydras or Mutalisks in time to defend this attack.

Transitions

If it appears that your opponent has way over-committed to defending your attack with units or Spine Crawlers, you can always retreat and go for the macro game. Either force field your opponent back and walk home or mass recall your army to your natural Nexus. A common follow-up to this build is starting a Robotics Facility and going for Colossi to deal with your opponent?s Roaches. Alternatively, you can go for a Stargate and make Phoenix in order to prepare for your opponent?s Mutalisks. Be sure to use Hallucinations often to check-up on what midgame tech your opponent is going for. Take a third base when you feel safe.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a Gateway expand, so your 5gate attack will hit very soon (before 7 minutes). This build usually hits your opponent before they have any midgame tech.

However, this build relies on you deflecting your opponent?s scouting information in order for it to be maximally effective. If your opponent sees your Gateway count before you move out, then it is unlikely you will be able to out-produce a mass Roach defense.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Nexus,MothershipCore,WarpgateUpgrade,Chronoboost,Probe,Sentry,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Sentry,Zealot,Sentry,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,WarpInSentry,WarpInSentry,WarpInZealot,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:18 AM;

This build opens with a fast expansion in order to get an economic advantage, using an Oracle for harass potential and defense until you can setup a Phoenix/Colossus midgame unit composition.

Benchmark: When your Robotics Facility finishes (@7:00ish), you should have 1 Oracle, 1 Stalker, 1 Sentry, a Mothership Core, and around 37 Probes.

Benchmark: When your 2nd Colossus finishes (@10:00ish), you should have 2 Colossi, 3 Phoenix, 1 Stalker, 3 Zealots, 2 Sentries, and a Mothership Core with over 50 Probes.

Scouting

Feel free to Probe scout after you build your Gateway in order to determine what your opponent is building. The majority of information about what Terran is doing however will come from what your opponent hits you with.  If you spot a Reaper coming into your base, then try and stop it from seeing your building Stargate with your Stalker and Mothership Core (do not worry too much if it is spotted however, for your Stargate is only initially being used for one Oracle). If you do not spot a Reaper, then send your Mothership Core and use its huge sight range to spot what buildings your opponent has inside of his base before returning home.

The majority of your midgame scouting will come from your Oracle. Use it to spot whether your opponent is opening with Bio, going for fast upgrades, fast triple Command Center, or strong 2 base timing. If you see an opening, then the Oracle can be used to harass your opponents SCVs, but the true purpose of the Oracle is constant scouting through the midgame. Your opponents 3rd base timing is especially useful as a good benchmark for when you should try and take your 3rd base.

Transitions

The build transitions into a Phoenix/Colossus midgame, with a standard Colossus/High Templar/Archon late game. As soon as you spot your opponent taking his 3rd base, secure a third of your own, then start 2 Forges and several more Gateways. Keep producing Phoenix and Colossus until you have around 7 of each (7 is a LOT for a normal game, but the heavily delayed High Templar tech means that you have a stronger army in the midgame), supplementing your army with Zealots when you have extra minerals. Finally, when your +1/+1 is halfway done, be sure to start a Twilight Council for +2/+2, Zealot Charge, and Templar Archives in order to reach your lategame army.

Tips

- In the early game, you are attempting to get your economy up enough to support Phoenix/Colossus on 2 bases.  Be sure to chronoboost your Probes constantly until you need to divert chronoboost to your Robotics Facility/Stargate.
- Against Reaper play, position your initial Stalker and Mothership Core defensively.  Try to deny it scouting your Stargate, but dont worry if it is scoutedthe Stargate is only initially used for one Oracle.
- The main purpose of your initial Oracle is for scouting. While it is true that you can kill several SCVs if your opponents Marines are out of position, do NOT sacrifice your Oracle for a few extra kills. The constant threat of harass and ability to scout for the first 10 minutes of the game is a lot more important than an extra SCV kill or two.
- Position your Phoenix defensively outside your main (to absolutely shut down any midgame drops) up until you are ready to take your third.  If/when your Oracle dies, use your flock of Phoenix to take map control and kill several SCVs with any extra APM you have.
- Take your third base and start 2 Forges as soon as you spot your opponent taking his 3rd base.
- Build more Colossus (up to 7) than you normally would (around 4). With the extra air support tanking and killing Vikings, your Colossus count must be quite large in order to take out your opponents Bio army.

Pros and Cons

This build gets out an early Oracle for harass potential and constant scouting. It also gets a strong economy and uses a midgame Phoenix/Colossus unit composition to defend drops and bio pushes with ease. This midgame composition is quite robust in terms of defending your third as well as stopping constant Medivac harass.

However, this build is short on Gateway units for the early stages of the game. Thus, any early drops are quite hard to stop unless you are able to scout them beforehand and prepare appropriately. Also, you do not start your Forges until you start your third base, so you will often be behind in upgrades against a macro-Terran.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,MothershipCore,Nexus,GasProbe,GasProbe,WarpgateUpgrade,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,Probe,Stargate,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Probe,Oracle,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Observer,RoboticsBay,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Observer,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,ExtendedThermalLance,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Phoenix,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Phoenix,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Phoenix,Chronoboost', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:14 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Maru 14 CC to MMMH Timing', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This CC First build takes your economy immediately into the midgame and then transitions into a 9 minute, 2 base Marine/Hellion/Medivac timing with Stimpack.

Scouting

Build the Command Center on the high ground and then wall-off with your initial Barracks. This way, you will not have to worry about early Zerglings because you will have a full wall. Thus, SCV scouting is no longer necessary.

Your first scouting comes from the first Hellions you make. With these Reactor Hellions, you can take map control, clears out any Zerglings at watchtowers, and pokes Zergs front to spot the Zergs third base, any buildings at the front, and any units that Zerg is making.

If you see a ton of Speedlings, then make sure your Hellion micro is on point. Feel free to pull back behind your natural wall in order to more effectively deal with Speedlings.

If you see Roaches, then immediately cut Reactor Hellion production and start making Widow Mines two at a time. Delay your Starport for a little while in order to afford Marauders, and consider cutting SCVs in order to complete a wall-off at your natural and prevent your opponent from running past your Bunker/Widow Mines.

If you see two Evolution Chambers, then assume your opponent is playing a macro game.

Alternatively, if you see a third base, then you can also assume your opponent is playing a macro game.

Transitions

This build transitions pretty normally into standard Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine play as well as Marine/Tank/Medivac play in a pretty common manner. However, because of the resources and time you have devoted to Bio units and upgrades, this build cannot transition into Mech.

For either the Bio/Mine or Marine/Tank transition, as you are pushing out, instantly start your 3rd Command Center, Combat Shields, and 2 Engineering Bays. It is also strongly suggested that you continue Medivac and Marine production before adding on more Barracks so that you can continue unrelenting drop play and keep your opponent on their half of the map while you are attempting to take your own third and get into your comfortable late-game infrastructure. When your Engineering Bays finish, be sure to start your Infantry upgrades, all of your Refineries, and throw down up to 5 more Barracks to be able to pump out your 3 base army.

If you are going for Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine play, be sure to start a Reactor on your naked Factory and start Widow Mine production (adding a 2nd Factory with a Tech lab for the Widow Mine upgrade once you have later secured your third).

If you are going for a Marine/Tank/Medivac play, be sure to start a Tech lab on your naked Factory and start Siege Tank production (adding a 2nd Factory with a Tech lab once you have later secured your third).

Tips

- Do NOT over commit with your initial Hellions. Use them exclusively for scouting purposes in the early game; their true purpose is to bolster your ground army in the actual Marine/Hellion/Medivac timing attack.
- Against any all-ins with this build, you must rely on your Bunker placement, SCV control, and scouting it coming. Be active on the map with your first Hellions so that you know what is coming your way before it gets to your doorstep.
- Feel free to push out with your Bio army even before Stimpack/Medivacs are even done. As long as you have Hellions scouting in front to ensure you are not being all-inned, your Bio army can be walking across the map while your Medivacs boost in behind them so that you hit your opponent the second Stimpack finishes.
- Do NOT clump up against Banelings. Your opponent should not be able to have that many Banelings by the 9 minute attack, but be sure to spread your army and micro appropriately if you see Banelings on the field.
- Remember to pick up your Marines into the Medivacs and boost away as soon as your army is finally overtaken. Keeping your opponent on their side of the map while you set up your own third base is crucial.
- Save at least one scan to kill creep. As a Zerg, losing your initial midgame creep and a Queen or two spreading it can be devastating for the later stages of the game.

Pros and Cons

This build opens quite economically, and then transitions into making a strong army and hitting your opponent with a lot of units at the 9 minute mark before they can even stabilize their third base economy. It is a very strong build for punishing greedy Zergs.

However, while it is a CC First opener that is not at all all-in, it is definitely not nearly as macro-oriented as the standard Reactor Hellion 3CC build or other 3CC builds such as Polts Map Control Build. Also, if your opponent can see it coming and overproduces units to defend, you will have to pick up and rely on drop play instead of a large frontal assault to get an advantage.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Bunker,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SCV,CallMule,Factory,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,SCV,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Refinery,TechLabOnBarracks,CallMule,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,StimPack,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marauder,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Starport,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleHellions,SCV,Marauder,SCV,CallMule,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,Marauder,DoubleMedivacs,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnFactory,Marauder,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:18 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Maru Reaper FE to Hellbat-Banshee Push', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE transitions into a fast 2 base Hellbat Banshee timing in order to crush your opponent early regardless of whether or not they open with Roaches.

Scouting

Use your Reaper to poke around your opponents natural and ascertain whether or not they are performing an early all-in. Later, when you have Hellions out, poke the front to ensure that your opponent is taking a 3rd base and not performing some delayed 2 base all-in. Favor keeping your Hellions alive over getting more scouting information/killing Drones because you will need every Hellion later for the Hellbat Banshee timing.

During your actual attack, be sure to note whether your opponent is defending with Roaches (which means a potential Roach/Hydra midgame, or at the very least delayed Mutalisks) or with Ling/Bane (which means a probable Ling/Bane/Muta midgame, and a more standard Mutalisk timing).

Transitions

This build opens with a 1/1/1 and therefore does not yet commit to a Bio or Mech midgame. It can in fact transition into either quite easily.

For a Bio (+Hellbat or Widow Mine) transition, start your 3rd Command Center as you swap off your Barracks onto the Starports Tech lab in order to start Stimpack research, 2 Engineering Bays, and 4 more Barracks. Use non-Stimpack Medivac drops to delay your opponent while you get up the necessary midgame infrastructure.

For a Mech transition, start your 3rd Command Center, 2 Factories, and 2 more Refineries. Continue Banshee production to deal with a Roach counter-attack as well as take advantage of the delayed Mutalisk tech.

Tips

- Use your initial Marine to try and pick off an early scouting Overlord as well as deny early Drone scouts.
- Your Reaper is not meant to deal damage, but rather give you some basic scouting and map control.
- Do NOT over-commit your Hellions while scouting around your opponents base; you will need all of them for the followup Hellbat Banshee timing to be effective.
- Try and position a Marine or two inside your base to shoot down any scouting Overlords.
- During the actual Hellbat Banshee attack, be sure to stutter step into Roaches and Queens, and spread/kite Zerglings and Banelings.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong 2 base all-in that can outright kill an unsuspecting Zerg opponent, and at the very least forces a huge response in order to defend. By forcing your opponent to make an army, you keep both of your economies low and extend the midgame (where Terran is arguably best in TvZ). Also, this build is better than an exclusively Hellbat attack because of Banshees effectiveness against Roaches.

However this attack requires a lot of micro in order to keep up with a rally of Hellions and Banshees. Also, it is a 2 base build, so has a much smaller economy than standard macro play.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Reaper,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,Factory,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,LiftRaxFromReactor,ReactorOnBarracks,CallMule,SCV,Starport,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SCV,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,DoubleHellions,Refinery,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnStarport,SCV,SCV,CallMule,CallMule,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleHellions,SCV,SCV,CloakingField,Banshee,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Armory,SCV,SCV,DoubleHellions,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,Banshee,CallMule,DoubleHellions', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:23 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'MC Oracle Expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This PvT opener opens with early Oracles to smash through un-upgraded marines and harass your opponents mineral line, all while taking an expansion back at home and transitioning into the midgame.

Scouting

This build opens aggressively with lots of units, so there is no need to be worried about early pressure. However, in order for you to control your Oracles well and attack in the correct places, it is necessary to know what your opponent is building. Thus, use your early game map control with your Stalkers and Mothership Core to poke in and see whether your opponent is going for Widow Mines/where they are building Turrets/how they have positioned their Marines so that you will know when and how to attack with your oracles.

Transitions

This build transitions into any normal midgame that you would like. At around the 8 minute mark, plant down either a Robotics Facility or Twilight Council to start your teching into Colossus or High Templars+Storm. Then, after your Oracle harass has finished, you will already be halfway to your desired tech. Getting more gateways down and the upgrades (+1 Ground Armor and Charge/Storm) started while you are harassing your opponent is very important.

Alternatively, you can go for a Phoenix/Colossus midgame army. Plant down a Robotics Facility at around the 8 minute mark and tech straight for Colossi on 4 Assimilators. When your Robotics Bay finishes, start 2 more Gateways, start your first Colossus, and begin producing Phoenix in order to re-converge to a play style akin to Jims Phoenix/Colossus Build.

Tips

- Use your first Stalker to deny an SCV/Reaper scout and keep your opponent in the dark as to what build you are going.
- Rally your Oracles to an airspace near your opponents base so that your push happens as soon as you are ready.
- The Mothership Core can poke in and around your opponents main base to see what tech buildings they have and/or what units they are building.
- Go in with your first Oracle if they opened with gas to start applying pressure soon. If you wait for 3 or 4 Oracles, a Widow Mine drop might be already on the way and you would not be able to defend it.
- Wait for more Oracles if they opened gasless 1rax FE and your stalkers have not been able to do any damage. If you go in too soon, then theyll just build a reactive missile turret and shut down your later Oracles.
- Remember: Oracles scale REALLY well. 3 Oracles can take down up to 10 marines without losing a single Oracle.  Be aggressive vs marines, and super defensive vs turrets/widow mines.
- Do not forget to include the Mothership Core in the fight  its DPS and Time Warp spell are very useful when taking out marines/units.
- Start that midgame transition BEFORE you focus on the harass in your opponents base so that after the Oracle harass has finished, you will already be halfway to your desired midgame tech.

Pros and Cons

This build gives you map control and hits your opponents with a lot of early game Oracles to destroy a mineral line. It is strong because Oracles absolutely destroy un-upgraded marines, and are maneuverable enough that they can track down and run after SCVs.

However, opening with this build delays your expand a lot more than if you had opened straight 1gate FE. Because you have less economy, the midgame Terran timing attacks with medivacs are even scarier than normal (unless you do damage with your Oracles), so you actually have to do damage to attempt to transition into the midgame. Remember that Oracles have very little health, so you have to babysit your units if you have any hope of not losing them instantly to a well placed Missile Turret/Widow Mine.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,MothershipCore,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Stargate,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Oracle,Probe,Nexus,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Chronoboost,Oracle,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Oracle,Probe,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:23 AM;

This is a highly aggressive, 1 base 1/1/1 all-in which focuses on early harass to damage your opponent while simultaneously building up army for a follow-up all-in. While this build has the potential to fall back into a macro game, transitioning into the midgame is difficult if early damage is not inflicted on the opponent.

Scouting

This build gives you several opportunities for scouting. Your first bit of information comes from getting your scouting SCV into his base between 12 and 16 food. If you manage to get your SCV into your opponents base, check for how many Refineries your opponent has. If your opponent does not have gas, they will most likely be doing a 1rax FE build. This presents one of the better scenarios for your early game Hellion drop to workespecially if your opponent does not anticipate the Hellion drop. If your opponent has one Refinery, it likely means that your opponent will be going for Reapers, have a Marine/Hellion defense, or have a Marine/Widow Mine defense. With your Hellions drop, do not over commit, simply keep your opponent busy. If your opponent attempts to Hellion expand, he will pull ahead economically assuming his defense prevents your hellions from inflicting any damage. You will most likely not see a second gas geyser with your SCV scout.

Once you have your first Hellions out, you should have full map control by clearing any XelNaga Towers and poking the front. Running in to spot your opponents natural is also a smart move, but be sure to pull back if there are any units defending. Your Hellions are there to increase the effectiveness of your later all-in, not to end the game early on.

Lastly, when you Hellion drop in his main, you should finally be able to see everything your opponent has gone for. If your opponent has gone for Cloaked Banshees, it will not instantly be a threat because he will need to keep the Banshee in his base to defend his workers. Later, once you have a Raven, Banshees will no longer be an issue. If your opponent has gone for Hellions of his own, be careful when out on the map, and always favor retreating if your Hellions are in danger. If your opponent has gone for Widow Mines, be sure to avoid obvious spots where he could have placed them.

Ideal Game

Your Hellion drop should inflict some kind of damage to your opponent and keep him occupied with defensive measures. However, even while doing damage with them, it is important to keep them alive. With ideal Hellion harass, your later all-in will overwhelm your opponent or trade in your favor.

If your opponent is prepared for the all-in engagement, he will most likely have either a Bunker, Siege Tanks, or both to defend. Your Hellions from earlier can help clear SCVs repairing the Bunker. Assuming you need to siege and push slowly because he has Tanks, consider dropping your Hellions again to divert some forces and his attention. However, remember that every unit is precious, so do not over commit with this drop.

Transitioning

In the situation where you cannot straight up win the game with your all-in but still have him contained, consider expanding and transitioning into Marine/Tank play or Mech. Simply throw down an expansion, take more gas, and ramp up your production from there.

If the all-in fails and your opponent is ahead economically, then you will have most likely lost the game. However, expanding and defending this base with Siege Tanks can still be a last-ditch option.

Tips

- With your first two Hellions, clear the XelNaga Watchtowers and take map control.
- During your Hellion drop, be sure to constantly pump Marines from your Reactored Barracks and produce Siege Tanks.  The strength of this build is the follow-up all-in, not the initial Hellion drop.
- Do NOT lose your Hellions when dropping them.  Use the Medivac boost to get your Hellions out of there if they are ever in danger.
- When moving out, be sure to bring 2 SCVs to repair.
- Slowly siege your opponent unless you are sure you can crush through the front.
- Remember to use Seeker Missile or Auto Turrets from your Raven to push the fight in your favor.

Pros and Cons

This build is a 1-2 punch of sortsfirst hitting with a Hellion drop and then following up with a Marine/Tank all-in. It is often too much for expanding opponents to handle and quickly ends the game. The Hellion drop can also be deadly harass if your opponent does not scout it or defend appropriately.

However, because this build was created by MarineKing himself, it is quite micro intensive, and thus is hard to pull off as a lower league player.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker back to the protection of your Sentries/Force fields and warp-in units quickly if you have to defend an early attack.

The majority of your scouting comes from your Hallucinated Phoenix. Your phoenix should be able to get into your opponents main base and determine what tech route you see your opponent going.

- If your opponent is expanding quickly, then feel safe. Consider going for a midgame Immortal+Gateway bust.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then be sure that you do not fall behind in the Immortal/Colossus count going into the midgame. Do NOT over produce Stalkers.
- If your opponent has a Stargate, then be sure to not take damage against early Phoenix or Oracles. Produce several Stalkers to initially protect your mineral lines, but consider getting a Stargate of your own or going for a quick Blink timing in order to truly stay safe against your opponent. Keep a tabs on when they take their natural expansion  a 3gate Stargate attack can be deadly if you are skipping too many warp-ins or teching too aggressively.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then make one Observer for detection against DTs and constantly produce Immortals. Also be sure to position your army/Mothership Core defensively in order to safely defend any Blink attacks.

Transitions

This build is a very strong macro opener that transitions into a macro game quite easily. However, the actual unit composition of that macro game very often depends completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with. If your opponent stays on one base for too long, then throw down more Gateways, constantly make units, and prepare to defend your natural with Stalkers, Immortals, and your Planetary Nexus. In Robotics vs Stargate macro games, quickly switch into Blink or Stargate play of your own so as to not lose against any Void Ray based armies. In Robotics vs Robotics macro games, Immortal count and/or Colossus count are the most important things.  Keep tabs on your opponents tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Robotics vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponents potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by producing Immortals+Gateway units or Colossus for defense.

Tips

- Use all your initial chronoboost on Probes so as to establish your economic advantage going into the midgame.
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial Stalker to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Traps 3gate All-in).
- Against all 1 base attacks, you must defend using your Planetary Nexus. To maximize your protection, save your Mothership Core energy as long as possible  only calling in your Planetary Nexus once your opponent has committed to attacks. Be sure to constantly chronoboost Immortals out for maximum DPS against ground-based armies.
- Against Blink play, be sure to position some of your army and an Immortal or two in your main base to destroy any Stalkers that blink up outside the range of your Planetary Nexus.
- Against Stargate play, be sure to warp-in some initial Stalkers and position your units to defend both mineral lines from potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very versatile, macro build that takes advantage of the power and range of your Planetary Nexus in order to stay safe against early attacks. It also gets detection and Immortals for defense, so very often you have a more stable opening than most other PvP builds.

However, defending early Stargate play can be quite tricky as your Robotics Facility does not help at all in producing anti-air units.

This build opens with a 1gate FE and then transitions into a strong timing attack with +2/+2 Chargelots and Archons.

Push out when your 3rd Archon finishes (@11:00ish) with 3 Sentries, 3 Archons, 1 Stalker, and around 12 Zealots, with +2/+2 about to finish.

Scouting

In the early game, Probe scout after your Gateway in order to spot whether your opponent is opening with a Reaper or Widow Mine drop. Against Reaper play you have to position your initial few units very defensively in order to avoid losing any Probes. Against a Widow Mine drop, be sure to build those Photon Cannons in your mineral lines as soon as your Forges finish. After the early game, scouting is much more minimal than you might expect. As long as you can confirm your opponent is not 1 base all-inning you (Hallucinations can give you a lot of information), you can perform this build.

Transitions

This build is a strong two base timing attack, so be sure to commit all your energy into non-stop warping in from a proxy Pylon in order to bust through your opponents front. In most situations, you will simply be able to walk through your opponents front and win the game.

However, if your opponent has a strong defense at his natural (Supply Depots and multiple Bunkers), you do already have plenty of Probes back at home, so you can simply start a 3rd Nexus, resume Probe Production, continue upgrades by getting +3/+3, and transition into Storm play. If you are going for this macro play, then be sure to get out several Colossus before you max out for a stronger 200 supply army.

Tips

- You are only able to afford so many units because of how many Probes you have. Be sure to Chronoboost your Nexii as often as possible in the early game to get up a strong 2 base economy.
- The limiting factor in this build is the Forge upgrades.  After the early game, Chronoboost your Forges as often as you can so that your 11 minute attack hits with +2/+2.
- Hallucinate Phoenix to get scouting information on your opponents opening build order.
- Against Reaper play, position your initial units defensively.
- Against Widow Mine play, be sure to get out those Photon Cannons in each mineral line on time. Using your Photon Overcharge and target firing an early Medivac can be a game changer in defending early pressure.
- Set up multiple proxy Pylons before you are ready to move out so that even if your opponent kills one or two of them, you will be able to reinforce your attack.
- During the attack, be sure that your army does not waste time attacking buildings.  Focus fire and reposition your army so that everything is always fighting your opponents army.
- If your opponent has a solid wall at his natural, then do not commit to a doomed attack. Simply playing the macro game with your upgrade advantage is a much stronger option.

Pros and Cons

This is a strong attack that destroys Bio players who do not have good building placement or who are playing too greedy. Also, your strong attack has +2/+2 and 60 Probes  so even if it fails, you have a strong economy and upgrade lead going into the late game.

This build is not great against early Widow Mine drops because your only detection is the Photon Cannons in your mineral lines. However if you defend a Widow Mine drop without losing too much, your follow-up attack will destroy your opponent unless they are very well prepared.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Nexus,MothershipCore,WarpgateUpgrade,Pylon,Stalker,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Forge,Forge,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,GroundWeaponsLevel1,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,GroundArmorLevel1,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,WarpInSentry,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,TwilightCouncil,Probe,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,Charge,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,GroundWeaponsLevel2,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,GroundArmorLevel2,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,TemplarArchives,Probe,Probe,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,WarpInHighTemplar,WarpInHighTemplar,WarpInHighTemplar,Pylon,Pylon,Pylon,WarpInHighTemplar,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInHighTemplar,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInZealot,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,WarpInHighTemplar,ArchonFromTwoHT,ArchonFromTwoHT,ArchonFromTwoHT,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:23 AM;

This build opens with a Gateway Expand and then transitions into a very quick all-in with 2 Immortals, a Warp Prism, and a lot of +1 Zealots.

Scouting

After the early game, scouting is much more minimal than you might expect. As long as you can confirm your opponent is getting a third Hatchery, you should be able to go through with this build.

However, if your opponent scouts your Robotics Facility early on, then you can send your Warp Prism directly towards your opponent?s base in order to both fake pressure and see what units/buildings they have made.  This Warp Prism poke provides a bit of scouting that may help you deduce what unit composition your opponent will try to defend your all-in with.

Transitions

This build is a 2base all-in, so there is no standard way to follow-up this build should the attack not outright win the game. If your opponent holds off your all-in without taking too much damage, then you will most likely lose the game soon after. That being said, starting more Assimilators and teching to either Colossi or Blink Stalkers (depending on what unit composition your opponent used to defend your all-in) for a second desperation all-in might just be enough to win the game.

Tips

- The limiting factor in this build is the Robotics Facility time. Be sure to chronoboost your Robotics Facility to get out the Warp Prism and Immortals in time for such a fast attack.
- Send your Warp Prism to your opponent?s base as soon as it completes for both fake pressure and potential scouting information.
- When you move out for the attack, be sure to fully wall-off your natural expansion (and even potentially build some cannons) to stop your opponent from running around your army and going for a base trade.
- The most important part of the army are your Robotics units. Keep your Zealots all in front of your Immortals/Warp Prism so that they tank all (or most) incoming damage. Using the Warp Prism, pick up Immortals that are being targeted down to move them further back behind your Zealot meat shield. If your Warp Prism is being targeted down, bring it out of the fight and retreat a bit before warping in more Zealots.
- If your opponent is trying to defend with Roaches or Mutalisks and you have a little extra gas, then mix in some Stalkers into the mix for some extra DPS.

Pros and Cons

This is a strong all-in that hits before your opponent can have much tech out in order to end the game quickly. With +1 Zealots dealing lots of damage to Zerglings, and Immortals shredding up Roaches, this build walks through most Zerg defenses with ease.

However, none of your units are anti-air. Thus, if your opponent gets out Mutalisks before your attack has dealt lots of damage, then you will be in a lot of trouble. Also, losing a single Immortal or the Warp Prism due to poor micro can almost instantly lose you the game.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Nexus,MothershipCore,WarpgateUpgrade,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Probe,Forge,Gateway,Probe,Zealot,Probe,Probe,WarpPrism,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Immortal,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Immortal,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,Pylon,Observer,Chronoboost,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:23 AM;

Because this build opens with as many different map control units as Terran has, there is no need for super early SCV scouting. Your initial scout comes from your Reaper(s) poking into your opponents base. Check for a lack of a natural, early gas, or any quick tech buildings. Consider cutting Hellions and getting Widow Mines instead if your opponent is going for a very early all-in.

The next scout comes from your Reapers and Hellions poking the front.  You should be able to spot a 3rd base and your opponents Queen count.  If you see a lack of Queens and no 3rd base, then be prepared for a 2 base all-in of sorts. Extra bunkers, a full wall-off, and Marauders/Siege Tanks are the best ways to defend most Roach or Baneling based all-ins.

Finally, your last scout comes from a Medivac drop and your Viking. Use your Viking to kill Overlords blocking your 3rd base or scouting around the map. You can also use the Viking to keep tabs on your opponents base count up until they have any anti-air (usually Mutalisks). Be sure not to lose the Viking to Queens, however, so stay off creep. Also, use your Medivac drop for map control at the front. Scan, kill creep, and pick up and leave with your 8 units up everywhere your opponent is spreading creep until your opponent has Mutalisks.

This build gets you map control in every way: initial ground control comes from your Reapers; follow-up ground control comes from your Reaper/Hellion pokes; follow-up air control comes from your Viking on Overlord-killing duty; and follow-up creep control comes from a squadron of Marine/Marauder in your Medivac. Be sure to use all of these to their fullest in order to have maximum scouting information.

Transitions

This build transitions well into both Marine/Tank or Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine. It can also transition into Mech, but anyone who watches Polt as a player knows that he never goes Mech in basically any matchup, so I have opted not to write-up the Mech transition.

For either transition, start Stimpack research and 2 Engineering Bays so that your midgame army will have some staying power on the field. Once you have minerals, throw down up to 7 Barracks and an extra Factory to reach the 3 base infrastructure that you need to out-produce your Zerg opponent. Start producing Siege Tanks or Widow Mines from your initial Factory to get a healthy unit count while you are building up your Bio army.

Lift up your third base and take your third once you feel safe, starting an Armory so as to continue your upgrades. Remember to stay on top of your huge mineral count. Because this build only stays on 3 buildings for unit production for quite some time, but gets you a similar income, your mineral income will seem much larger than you think. Start those Engineering Bays and Barracks as soon as you can afford them for a strong midgame army.

Tips

- Do NOT over commit your initial Reapers by trying to kill Drones. Use them more for scouting and prioritize keeping them alive so as to keep your opponents early game units back at home.
- Do NOT over commit your initial Reaper/Hellion poke by trying to kill Drones. Again, use them more for scouting and prioritize keeping them alive unless you see a huge opening that you can punish (such as spotting your opponents Queens off creep and knowing that your opponent does not have Zergling Speed).
- If you spot your opponent going all-in, then be sure to stop map-control-unit production and instantly begin Widow Mines and Marauders. Adding an extra Bunker and/or completing your wall-off at your natural will help provide buffers against any incoming attacks as well.
- When your Viking pops, be sure to shoot down as many Overlords as you can. Simply shift-queue up an attack route around all of your side of the map in order to kill any Overlords your opponent has that are off creep.
Use your initial Medivac and several Marines/Marauders for creep-killing duty. Scan, kill creep, and pick up and leave with your 8 units up everywhere your opponent is spreading creep until your opponent has Mutalisks. Try and pick off a Queen if you can.
- Once you throw down your 3rd Command Center, you are going to have A LOT of minerals. Be sure to transition quickly by starting the Engineering Bays, Barracks, and Refineries as soon as you can afford them.

Pros and Cons

This build is quite strong because of its ability to scout and harass early on.  With Reapers, Hellions, Vikings, and Medivacs all being used to take map control, and a 1/1/1 at home with the versatility to react to whatever units your opponent seems to be making, this build is also quite safe against any early all-ins that your opponent might try to do. Finally, if your opponent ever slips up and does not adequately prepare for your continuous production of map control units, you can quickly kill many Drones and take a huge economic advantage as what happens in game 5 of Polt vs HyuN.

However, this build is not quite as economical as a 3CC build such as Innovations Reactor/Hellion 3CC build. It also requires a lot of APM in order to micromanage all of your early game harassing/map control units while keeping up your macro at home. Finally, it delays Stimpack by several minutes when compared to most other builds, so all of your early aggression must come from Stimpack-less Bio units and your map control units.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Reaper,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Factory,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Starport,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleHellions,SCV,Marine,Viking,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,Marine,SCV,DoubleWidowMines,SCV,SCV,Marine,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Marine,CommandCenter,Medivac,SCV', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:23 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'PartinG 3 Base 7 Gate', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Nexus First and only enough units to secure a ridiculously fast 3rd base. With a 3 base economy, it then hits a 9 minute 7 gate attack comprised of mainly Stalkers and Sentries.

Scouting

This build opens incredibly greedily, so be sure that your opponent is expanding and droning with an initial Probe scout. Besides any initial Probe(s), however, this build does not give you any tools with which to scout your opponent. The majority of your scouting will come with the actual attack at 9 minutes.

Transitions

This build can either all-in or transition comfortably into a macro game.

If you are choosing to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly warp-in and chronoboost your Gateways, set up several proxy Pylons around your opponent?s third base, and stop all Probe production.

If you are choosing to play the macro game, then only use the attack to hopefully deal a bit of damage while you continue producing Probes and teching at home. Getting a Twilight Council, all of your gasses, and going for a +2 Blink Stalker army is a good choice.  Alternatively, you can start a Robotics Facility, all of your gasses, and go straight for Colossi.

Tips

- Spend all of your early game chronoboost on your two Nexus to maximize Probe production.
- Keep your Mothership Core out in front of your natural to help ward off any scouting Zerglings.
- Until you are ready to attack, position your Sentries and Zealot very defensively. Staying against buildings or walls will increase the effectiveness of defensive force fields dramatically.
- Use 2 of your Gateways to wall-in a Photon Cannon while your third base is being set up. A Cannon that cannot be targeted by Zerglings is incredibly effective at stopping runbys.
- Be sure to start moving out before +1 actually finishes in order to hit your opponent as early as possible.
- Constantly warp-in Stalkers with the attack, using your initial 8 Sentries to keep back enemy Roach/Ling armies.
- Don?t forget to mass recall your army back home if you end up getting surrounded.

Pros and Cons

This build is an incredibly greedy build that initially powers economy hard and then transitions into a powerful 7 Gate attack. You have both a strong army and a strong economy.

However, this build does not get much tech before the attack. Therefore, transitioning out of your attack into a more standard unit composition takes more time than more standard PvZ builds.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Nexus,Gateway,Pylon,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Zealot,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,MothershipCore,Sentry,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Forge,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,GroundWeaponsLevel1,Sentry,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Nexus,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,PhotonCanon,PhotonCanon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,WarpInSentry,WarpInSentry,WarpInSentry,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,WarpInSentry,WarpInSentry,WarpInStalker,Probe,Probe', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:23 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'PartinG Proxy Stalker Rush', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This cheese proxies your initial Pylon at your opponent?s natural and makes Stalkers 2 at a time from 2 proxied Gateways. This proxy Stalker Rush is a very effective cheese that focuses on early game micro to destroy your opponent before the midgame.

Scouting

This build skips all scouting, for you are placing your first Pylon proxied at your opponent?s natural expansion regardless of what your opponent is doing. All of your scouting will come from your initial attack with your first Gateway units. The build itself will not change regardless of what you scout ? only your unit positioning and micro.

Transitions

This proxy Stalker Rush is an all-in in every respect: proxying the initial Pylon at your opponent?s natural, cutting Probe production at 12, non-stop chronoboosting your Gateways, and skipping Warpgate Research. Thus, there is no well-defined transition. If you are late in your execution and do not outright kill your opponent (or at least take out their army and 10+ Probes), then you will most likely lose the game to any sort of Gateway attack follow-up.

Tips

- ALL OF YOUR CHRONOBOOST MUST BE DUMPED INTO YOUR GATEWAYS. The limiting factor on this build is how fast you can pump out units from your Gateways. Be sure to non-stop chronoboost your Gateways as they are producing the Zealot and later Stalkers so as to attack as early as possible.
- Poke in with your first Zealot and Probe and force your opponent to lose mining time. However, be wary of a Probe surround. Favor keeping the Zealot alive over killing enemy Probes.
- Once your first 2 Stalkers finish, you must commit to the attack as quickly as possible and never stop Stalker production until either you have won the game or you have lost all of your units. The strength of this all-in is how quickly and ferociously it attacks, but if you are not constantly attacking then your opponent?s economic advantage can destroy you.
- If your opponent pulls a lot of Probes to defend, be sure to back off and fight near the main ramp. Use your 18 Pylon to buffer damage and provide high ground vision for your Stalkers to shoot up the cliff.

Pros and Cons

This proxy Stalker Rush is a hyper-aggressive all-in that is able to get 2 Stalkers and 1 Zealot at your opponent?s base at 4:00. Because of how quickly this build attacks, it can punish most greedy PvP builds or players with poor micro with ease.
Unfortunately, this all-in can be scouted because your initial buildings must all be built in your opponent?s natural.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Polt Gas First Banshee', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This gas first Banshee opener used by Polt and many other top level Korean Terrans opens with the fastest Cloaked Banshees possible. The Banshee(s) are used to stay safe against early attacks as well as harass your opponent, in order to get an economic advantage going into the midgame.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your Orbital Command to check whether or not your opponent is opening with Reapers. Against an opponent opening Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe; thus, you should try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or expanded at your natural with your first few Marines.

Your next scout will come with your Banshee. With this Banshee, you can check what your opponents opener is. Against another Banshee player, follow-up your first Banshee with a Raven (and then potentially Viking if extra anti-air is needed). Against a Hellbat dropping player, make a few Widow Mines to burrow defensively against any incoming drop, as you use several Banshees to out-harass him. Against a player going for a Widow Mine Drop, position your Marines defensively at home and be sure to have enough scans to deal with his Widow Mines. Building a Raven might be useful, but not until after you have 2 Banshees with which to harass your opponent.

Finally, be sure to keep an eye out on what midgame transition your opponent is doing. Look for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either all-in, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play quite easily.

For an all-in transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory and start Siege Tank production instantly. When you hit 2 or 3 Siege Tanks, grab all of your Marines (>20), your Banshees/Vikings, and attempt to break your opponents front with a slow siege push.

It is possible to go into Marine/Tank or Mech after a 3 Command Center follow-up if you are sure your opponent will not be going for any more early game pressure. Start a Raven in order to save enough minerals to afford 2 Command Centers and then transition into either Marine/Tank or Mech just as below.

When transitioning into macro Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production after you start a 2nd Command Center. That way you have enough defense early and later can have a strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use. Against 2rax Reaper, you should delay your Tech lab until your Factory has completed at least one Hellion. Otherwise you might straight up die before you even start your first Banshee.
- Watch for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop your Banshee as you enter your opponents base.  Cloak your Banshee as soon as you see any potential for burrowed Widow Mines.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that are undefended by a Turret. If you are transitioning to a 1/1/1 all-in, then be sure to target-fire Marines as well, for this directly strengthens your attack.
- Always favor keeping your Banshee(s) alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two. You can also repair a weakened Banshee at home with SCVs if you can keep it alive.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural.  You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This gas first Banshee build is an aggressive opener in TvT. Also, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for you are able to transition into an all-in, 3 Command Center play, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play. Also, this build requires a lot less APM than other TvT builds, so it can be very useful for lower league players.

However, this build is extraordinarily weak against early Reaper builds because you open with so few Marines. Also, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind your opponent in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades, especially if they open with a fast expansion. Finally, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,SCV,Factory,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,Refinery,SCV,Marine,Starport,TechLabOnFactory,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,LandStarportOnTechLab,Banshee,CloakingField,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,CallMule,WidowMine,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Banshee,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:24 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Polt Reaper FE into 3 Rax', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE gets out a lot of units quickly in order to defend any Oracle or Blink Stalker attacks, while transitioning directly into completely standard 2 Base bio infrastructure. The versatility of this build sets it apart from the other TvP openers: Polts build lets you defend, attack, or play off any shenanigans your opponent may through at you.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they get an expansion (or note if they do not expand by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Extra Bunkers and/or an Engineering Bay for defense may be a smart investment.

If your opponent is going for a 2 Base Blink Stalker attack, then slow down your tech and gas income in favor of more units and more Bunkers. Start 2 Bunkers at the front and be ready to repair them with SCVs while you buy time for Combat Shields, more Marauders, and eventual Medivacs to pop.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and a large Bio army.  As you are taking map control with your initial Medivacs, be sure to add a 3rd Command Center, 2 more Barracks, and finish getting Concussive Shells and Combat Shields. Add on another Engineering Bay and an Armory to continue your upgrades as soon as you can afford it.

Note that you can switch the order of the 4th and 5th Barracks with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost and the scary late game Protoss army, most Terrans have been getting their infrastructure up early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having extra reinforcements.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important; if you keep all of your SCVs in gas, then you will not have the minerals to get your Command Center or extra Barracks at the correct time.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper.  Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add up to 2 Bunkers at the front, and start that Marauder production as soon as possible.
- Oracles massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you should consider skipping Marauders for more Marines or even start an emergency Engineering Bay for one turret per mineral line.
- Polt sometimes goes for an optional poke with his initial Marauder and several Marines if he has confirmed his opponent is not going for a Stargate. Be sure to keep these units alive  their only purpose is to take up a central XelNaga Watch tower
- When transitioning into the midgame, setting up your infrastructure while being aggressive with your first few Medivacs can outright win you the game.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because of the versatility inherent in its play. It makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game, gets up enough infrastructure to deal with all early and midgame attacks such as Oracle all-ins or Blink Stalker Timings, and then transitions into a completely standard bio midgame. It truly is an effective build to learn if you want to play safe and standard in TvP.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that it requires good scouting in order to take advantage of the versatility inherent in the build.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GoOutScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,MineralScv,CallMule,SCV,CommandCenter,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,Marine,StimPack,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,DoubleMarines,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,Factory,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,ScannerSweep,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,CallMule,Refinery,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,EngineeringBay,Marine,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,DoubleMarines,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,CombatShield,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,SCV,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMedivacs,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,ConcussiveShells,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:27 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Rain 1 gate FE to Colossus', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This safe fast expand build opens with a 1gate FE and then transitions into Colossi and double upgrades as fast as possible in order to go into the late game with an upgrade and tech advantage over a Terran opponent.

Benchmark: @100% +1/+1 (@10:30ish), you should have around 55 Probes, 1 Sentry, and 2 Colossi.

Scouting

This is a very safe macro build, getting you enough units in the early game for scouting or defensive purposes, so Probe scouting is usually unnecessary.  If your opponent sends a Reaper at your base, then be defensive with your initial Zealot/Stalker, and use only your Mothership Core to scout around.  If your opponent does NOT send a Reaper at your base, then poke out with your initial Zealot/Stalker and later Mothership Core to poke at your opponents front and glean some information about their build.

While your early game is completely safe, therefore making Probe scouting irrelevant, the early midgame is not, and thus scouting is crucial. If you know that your opponent is going for a Widow Mine drop, then get out Observers and several more Stalkers and place them defensively in each mineral line. Be prepared to use the Mothership Cores Photon Overcharge on whichever Nexus your opponent chooses to drop. Delay Colossus tech in order to favor more units to deal with the harass. This same reaction works against all early drop-based or Banshee play. Against any early frontal assaults, simply Planetary Nexus your natural expansion and warp-in several more units.

Transitions

This build is quite macro-oriented, so playing for the long-game is crucial.  Against standard Bio play, Bio/Mine play, or Bio/Hellbat play, take your third base after your 3rd Colossus and transition into Chargelots, Archons, and Storm. Add more Gateways as your minerals permit. Also, Blink is a good upgrade to prioritize against heavy drop play on maps with a large distance between your main and third bases.

Against Mech play, take your third base and begin heavy Immortal production.  Make Immortals, Archons, and High Templar while on 3 bases, and focus on hitting a +3/+3 timing attack before your opponent is maxed.  Add more Robotics Facilities as your gas permits.

Pros and Cons

This build stays safe against early shenanigans as you macro up and tech straight for Colossus and +1/+1. It also gives you the infrastructure necessary to defend early drops or harassment common in this matchup.  With your upgrade lead and tech advantage, you can safely transition into the lategame by safely taking another base and going for Storm.

Tips

- Chronoboost your initial Nexus to get out as many probes as early as possible to kick start your economy.
- Use your initial units defensively if you spot a Reaper, or aggressively to scout your opponents base if no Reaper appears at your door by the time your Stalker has popped.
- Send your first Observer directly to your opponents base in order to see if hes opening with fast Widow Mines/harassing units, or teching up to a normal Bio timing. Only warp-in units before you get your first Colossus out if you scout your opponent playing aggressively. Delay your Colossus tech and production if you spot your opponent going for a quick drop or early attack play. Instead, focus on making Gateway units and Observers and placing them defensively to maintain your economic advantage. However, if your opponent is NOT attacking early, always prioritize economy and teching up over making Gateway units
- Never underestimate the power of making your Nexus a Planetary Nexus.  At the very least, it is a way to scare off a drop from doing economic damage if your army is out of position.
- Against early drops, target firing the Medivac with your Stalkers and Planetary Nexus can mean the difference between letting your opponent escape and crushing a poorly planned drop.
- Dont forget to use your Mothership Cores Time Warp spell against any 2 base Bio timings in order to keep your Colossus safe.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Zealot,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,Chronoboost,WarpgateUpgrade,Probe,Probe,Probe,Nexus,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Pylon,Probe,RoboticsFacility,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Observer,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Observer,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,RoboticsBay,Probe,Chronoboost,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Forge,Forge,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,GroundWeaponsLevel1,GroundArmorLevel1,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,ExtendedThermalLance,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,TwilightCouncil,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:27 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Reaper FE with mine drop to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE gets out a fast Factory so that you can defend any early Protoss pressure with Widow Mines and Bunkers. It then transitions into standard Bio play for a 10 minute Medivac attack.

Scouting

The very beginning of this build is somewhat fragile (opening with a Reaper FE means that you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper.  Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they expand (or note if they do not get a fast expansion by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play as you sacrifice your Reaper into your opponents base. If you are playing against a 1 basing Protoss, then constantly produce Widow Mines  do not just stop at 1. Also, if you do not know whether or not your opponent has built a Stargate, building a Bunker in your main mineral line for 4 Marines to sit in and shoot any early game Oracles is not a bad idea too.

Push out when your first set of Medivacs finish (@10:10ish) with 3 Medivacs, around 6 Marauders and 26 Marines, and 53 SCVs at home

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and Medivacs. After this build, get Concussive Shells, take a 3rd Command Center, continue your upgrades by getting and Armory and another Engineering Bay, build 2 more Barracks, and react to whatever midgame splash damage your opponent is getting. Against Colossi, get a 2nd Starport; against Storm, get a Ghost Academy.

Tips

- If you are not comfortable with pulling SCVs in and out of gas, then simply ignore the two notes telling you to pull an SCV out of and then later put one more into gas (at 15 and 22 supply).
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper.  Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), then continue making Widow Mines.  Also, consider moving your natural to your main base and defending on one base.
- Oracles massacre un-upgraded Marines, so position your Widow Mines effectively.  Also consider adding a Bunker in your mineral line if your opponent has a Stargate to further defend Oracle pressure.
- If your opponent is not playing aggressively, then drop your Widow Mine(s) and Marines at your opponents base.  Do not over commit if your opponent already has a detection/Cannons ready for you.
- This build gives you enough gas to start Marauder production much earlier than most other builds.  Be sure to ramp up your Marauder production early in order to make a beefier army than your opponent.
- Move out as soon as your Medivacs pop.  Stimpack, while not yet done, should finish by the time you get to your opponents base.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because it gives you the economy and infrastructure on par with a Wings of Liberty style 1rax FE. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Not to mention the fact that you start Widow Mine production very early in order to stay safe against any potential Protoss aggression.

However, this build is somewhat vulnerable to early Protoss pokes, especially if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that you start Stimpack a little later than other builds that go directly for Stimpack research, but you will still have Stimpack done for the 10 minute Medivac timing.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Bunker,SCV,DoubleMarines,GasScv,Factory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,Starport,WidowMine,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Medivac,CallMule,DoubleMarines,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Refinery,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnStarport,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,EngineeringBay,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,ScannerSweep,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,LiftStarportFromTechLab,LandRaxOnTechLab,LandRaxOnTechLab,StimPack,CombatShield,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnStarport,CallMule,SupplyDepot,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMedivacs,Marauder,CallMule,DoubleMarines,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Marauder,DoubleMarines,Marauder', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:27 AM;

This Reaper FE transitions into a very quick 2 base Stim timing with Combat Shields. With such a fast attack, you can set the pace of the game instead of letting Protoss dictate when you attack.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they get an expansion (or note if they do not expand by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Extra Bunkers and/or an Engineering Bay for defense may be a smart investment. However, if you can hold until Stimpack and Combat Shields finish (@8:50ish  much earlier than most other builds), then you will be in a great position to counter attack your opponent and do crippling damage.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and a large Bio army.  Before you focus on your attack, be sure to start a Factory for a standard Reactored Medivac follow-up. After the attack, get a 3rd Command Center, 2 more Barracks (for a total of 5), 2 Engineering Bays, and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to head into a strong, late game army.

Note that you can switch the order of the 4th and 5th Barracks with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost and the scary late game Protoss army, most Terrans have been getting their infrastructure up early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having extra reinforcements.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important; if you keep all of your SCVs in gas, then you will not have the minerals to get your Command Center or extra Barracks at the correct time.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add up to 2 Bunkers at the front, and start that Marauder production as soon as possible.
- Oracles massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you should consider skipping Marauders for more Marines or even start an emergency Engineering Bay for one turret per mineral line. Note that even if your opponent does early game damage with an Oracle, your 9 minute attack can still end the game if your opponents follow-up is not executed precisely.
- Be sure to move out with your army BEFORE Stimpack and Combat Shields finish. You want to be attacking your opponents natural expansion as soon as those two upgrades finish.
- If your opponent is out of position, you can kill their entire army or snipe their natural expansion. However, be sure that you focus fire one or the other down  losing too much DPS by having your units attack both the Nexus and the army is the main way to screw up the attack.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because of how many units you can get out for a pre-10 minute attack. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Therefore, this build is a much more aggressive variant of the other Reaper expands possible in TvP.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that with such a low Marine count in the early game, fast Oracles can do a lot of damage if your scouting is not perfect.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,GoOutScv,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Barracks,SCV,DoubleMarines,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,DoubleMarines,OrbitalCommand,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,DoubleMarines,StimPack,Marine,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,CombatShield,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,Factory,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marauder,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,Starport,Refinery,ReactorOnFactory,EngineeringBay,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,CallMule,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,InfantryWeaponsLevel1', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:27 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Sage Blink All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with some light Stalker pressure and then follows up with a 3gate Blink Stalker all-in, using the Mothership Core for high ground vision and Time Warp.

Blink into the main when Blink finishes (@7:40ish) with 12 Stalkers and 25 Probes at home.

Scouting

This build is an aggressive opener that makes a lot of units, so you will not have to worry about Probe scouting. Against Reaper play, keep your first Stalker on a common hop-up ledge in order to deny your opponent scouting the Twilight Council. Against other defensive play, poke out to your opponents front with your first Stalker and check to see whether your opponent is going for Widow Mines or a quick CC into Bio so you know how to micro when you Blink into his main base with all of your units.

Transitions

This build is an all-in, so there is no standard follow-up. If your attack does damage and you keep most of your units alive, then you can take a natural expansion and transition into Upgrades+Storm. However, if you do not do significant damage with your initial Stalkers and also lose them, you are most likely out of the game because your midgame tech and economy will be vastly behind that of your opponent.

Tips

- Do not bother Probe scouting, you can do this build against nearly everything your opponent chooses to open with.
- With your initial Stalkers, either protect your main base from a Reaper scouting your Twilight Council or move out and poke up at your opponents base for some early scouting intel.
- The limiting factor with this build is Blink Researchs build time, so be sure to Chronoboost that Research constantly in order to attack as soon as possible.
- Keep your Mothership Core out of harms way. Use its 14 sight range for high ground vision, but do not commit the Mothership Core in the attack because without high ground vision, your attack will most likely fail.
- Do not forget to use your Mothership Cores Time Warp ability to help pick off SCVs or Bio units that are out of position.
- Do NOT over-commit your Stalkers in a risky blink. Only aggressively blink to get up to a high ground or to pick off a Siege Tank/Widow Mine before it activates.
- Constantly warping-in more Stalkers to reinforce your army and add strength to the attack is key to crushing through your opponents defenses.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong build because of how quickly you get both high ground vision with your Mothership Core and enough Blink Stalkers to do real damage.

However, this build is in fact an all-in, so there is no standard transition should the attack fail. Also, if your Stalker positioning is sub-optimal, a Reaper may scout your Twilight Council and reveal the build before you have even moved out to attack.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Stalker,TwilightCouncil,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Stalker,Blink,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,MothershipCore,Pylon,Gateway,Gateway,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:27 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Proxy Thor Drop', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build rushes for Thors and a Medivac as fast as possible and then goes for a hilarious all-in with Thor Drops. There is no transition with this build  you pull all your SCVs and crush your opponent as soon as possible.

Scouting

There is no purpose scouting. You are going to do the same build no matter what, and it only wastes mining time to pull an SCV from the mineral line.

Transitions

There are no transitions from this all-in. Keep rallying Marines and your next Thor and all of your SCVs and hope it is enough to win the game.

Tips

- When your Medivac pops, load up your Thor and drop your opponent, trying to kill production or SCVs.
- Avoid fighting your opponents army with your initial Thor drop at all costs. Only engage your opponents army directly once your Marines and SCVs are in the fight as well.
- Make sure to pull around 10 SCVs and attack with all of your Marines when you start your 2nd Thor so that your 2 Thors, 12 Marines, and 10 SCVs all get to your opponents base at the same time.
- During the fight, surround your Thor(s) with SCVs and repair.
- Use your Marines for a bit of extra DPS as they sit behind your Thor(s), but the true power of this all-in comes from the fact that Thors being repaired take close to no damage from early game Terran units.

Pros and Cons

This build rolls over most 1rax FE builds. Also, its a hilarious all-in that straight up kills unprepared opponents or opponents who dont have good repair micro. Also, a huge pro is that this build IS A THOR DROP.

However, this build is very weak against Reapers because you only have 2 Marines to defend against Reapers in the early game. That being said, if you can ward off the Reapers without losing too many SCVs, you might still win because Thors are obviously strong against Reapers in direct fights.  This build is also very bad against Banshees, but its possible to win the base trade because Thors also destroy Banshees in an actual fight.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Factory,CallMule,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Armory,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,Starport,SCV,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,Thor,Medivac,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Thor,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:27 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Scarlett Macro Mutalisk Style', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

The definitive macro build of modern ZvT, Scarlett?s fast 3 Hatch style quickly transitions into the most commonly used composition of Zergling, Baneling, Mutalisk. Utilizing a gasless opener with a high Queen count and fast upgrades, this is by far the best build with which to learn ZvT.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of very early force, make a few Zerglings to stay safe. However, do NOT overproduce early game units because this will slow down your 3 base saturation, and thus your midgame strength. Your next scout will be with an Overlord just after you start your +1/+1 (@7:15ish). This is merely to scout whether your opponent is opening with 3 base Bio play, 3 base Mech play, or a 2 base timing. If your opponent is going Mech, immediately abandon this build. Zerglings and Banelings are highly ineffective against Hellbats, Hellions, and Siege Tanks, so begin violently tech switching based off of Terran?s composition; Mutalisks for Tanks, Swarm Hosts for Hellbat Thor, etc. Continuing Mutalisk production is fine, but be sure to take a much earlier 5th base and Infestation Pit, as well as a Roach Warren. If your opponent is opening bio, proceed as the build dictates.

Transitions

As soon as you confirm that your opponent is going for a 3rd Command Center, feel free to start your 4th Hatchery. Against Mech play, transitioning into Swarm Hosts, Mutalisks, or Vipers is very strong. Against Bio/Mine play, transitioning into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk or mass Zergling/Baneling is also quite strong. Assuming you have not scouted Mech, your transition into standard Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk should serve you fine against any bio based composition. Emphasize Zerglings against Bio/Mine, Banelings against Bio/Hellbat, and Mutalisks against Marine/Tank.

Tips

- Be sure that you take map control with your initial Zerglings. Being able to spot when and with what your opponent moves out on the map can be crucial in defending any early timings.
- Metabolic Boost will not finish until just before 8 minutes with this build. If your opponent is hitting you very early, then a Spine Crawler and/or extra Queens will be more useful than slow Zerglings.
- As above, beware Reapers pressuring the Drone that attempts to take your 3rd base. You will have to defend it cautiously with Queens and your slower Zerglings. This is where creep spread will greatly assist you.
- Just after you start your +1/+1 upgrades, be sure to send a sacrificial Overlord into your opponent?s base to check whether your opponent is going for a Mech or Bio build.
- Against a Banshee based opener, over-produce Queens and conserve energy for Transfuses, without compromising either your creep spread or your injects too much.
- Be aware of the flow of each Terran composition. For example, Bio/Mine typically means non stop aggression, so usage of static defense to buy time and Mutalisks to intercept reinforcements is critical.
- Mutalisks are prioritized in this build over the other two components; Zerglings and Banelings. It is important to be as active with them as possible without compromising your macro.
- Against Bio/Mine, engage in small groups whenever possible to abuse the long cooldown of Widow Mines to the maximum effect.
- Against Bio/Hellbat/Thor, be sure to emphasize a ground army instead of a Mutalisk based composition. More Banelings and a faster hive are highly recommended, and be sure to fight on creep to get the best possible Baneling connections.
- Be aware of the standard creep clearing push that every bio Terran executes between 10 to 12 minutes, using their first two Medivacs, 15 to 25 Marines with Combat Shield/Stimpack, and the survivors of the Reaper/Hellion squad; be sure to have Banelings ready to defend, and surrender non essential creep tumors (any tumors placed upon paths he will not attack on).
- Using the Mutalisks to deny the fourth base as long as possible is critical to victory. Because you have made so many Mutalisks, your own Hive Tech will be delayed, so you must delay Terran as long as possible in turn.
- The build gets looser and more flexible as the game goes on, as is to be expected. As you are first trying out this build, you will either be far too greedy, and die with too many Drones, or far too safe, and die with not enough Drones. Constantly adjust the ratio of Drones to units based upon what you scout and the flow of the game, and learn the precise moments when you are completely free to Drone, and when you are not to maximize your success with this build.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong against almost all standard Terran openers. It gets 4 Queens for safety, injects, creep spread, and to defend a very quick 3rd Hatchery. With such a fast third, your midgame economy is also quite solid. This build is also currently viewed as the best way to play macro ZvT. It has no inherent weaknesses, and thus will always guarantee that the better player wins the game.
However, because you delay your Extractors in favor of 4 Queens, this build is not as safe against 1 Base all-ins than an opener that gets a very fast Metabolic Boost. Additionally, because you are opening gasless, Reaper openers have to be defended purely with Queens and your Terran opponent may be more inclined to play much greedier than he normally would against a gas opener.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Queen,InjectLarva,Queen,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Hatchery,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Overlord,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,EvolutionChamber,EvolutionChamber,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,MeleeAttacksLevel1,GroundCarapaceLevel1,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Lair,SpawnCreepTumor,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,BanelingNest,Drone,Hatchery,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Spire,PneumatizedCarapace,Hatchery,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,CentrifugalHooks,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,MeleeAtacksLevel2,GroundCarapaceLevel2,Overseer,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,FlyerCarapaceLevel1,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:31 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'SaSe DT Rush', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This DT rush opens with a 3 Stalker Rush for safety and map control, and then gets out fast DTs either for offense (taking advantage of your opponent?s possible lack of detection early on) or defense (applying pressure while you safely take an expansion of your own).

Scouting

This build is a pretty unsafe build in general, only giving you 3-5 units for the early game timings, thus scouting is huge. However, because this build was created by SaSe, you are also low on minerals for quite some time and thus cannot afford losing mining time by scouting with a Probe.  Therefore, in the early game merely scout in your base for a proxy Gateway with the Probe who builds the 2nd Pylon; the rest of your scouting will come from your 3 Stalkers. Being active with these 3 Stalkers around your natural, third, and watchtower will prevent your opponent from sneaking proxy Pylons past you and hitting you with a very early Gateway attack. Thus, you will be able to see an incoming push coming before it?s too late, and can delay/cancel your fast expand in favor of more units if you need to.

Transitions

This build transitions very smoothly into Chargelot/Archon builds or Blink Stalker builds. To make either transition, first resume chronoboosting out probes from both Nexi and then start your research of choice (Charge or Blink). Adding on 2 more Gateways, and applying midgame pressure with lots of Gateways and 1 or 2 Archons is a great way to force units out of your opponent, scout what midgame tech he?s going, and possibly end the game if your DTs did too much damage.

Pros and Cons

This build is great because it gets a reasonably timed expansion, gives you DTs early for map control and potential game-ending damage, and lets you transition into an aggressive midgame with either Chargelots or Blink Stalkers at the core of your army composition.
However, this build is very weak vs Oracle openers, for they give both detection and a great way to harass your naked mineral line. Also, against early attacks that hit before your Dark Shrine finishes, if you miss the proxy Pylon because you are not active enough with your first three stalkers, you can straight up lose the game.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Speedling All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Speedling all-in is a cheese designed to hard and blind-counter a Gateway Expanding Protoss player in the current metagame. It also has varying success against a FFE, depending on your opponent?s building placement.

Scouting

You only need to Drone scout for the Protoss on a 4 player map such as Whirlwind or Red City. Your early Spawning Pool prevents you from having the minerals to scout with a Drone on any other map. Instead of scouting with your units, the vast majority of your scouting will come from your initial Overlords? vision. Also, you do not need to scout for any Protoss cheeses because cheese should counter any of their cheeses quite effectively.

Transitions

Because this build is straight-up cheese, there is no true transition to this build. However, if you do damage and want to continue into a macro game, take a natural Hatchery and start a 2nd Queen to play a 2base, map control play style.

Tips

- Position your Overlords to give you vision of your opponent?s walls. Attacking the holes in your opponent?s building placement is crucial with this build, but that can only be easily done once you have vision of these holes.
- Use your initial 6 Zerglings to do as much damage as possible, along with scouting the Protoss for unusual play.
Avoid placing your Zerglings in a position where they can be surrounded by Probes and/or Zealots. Always retreat and poke in another area instead of committing to a bad position to get a guaranteed kill on a single target.
- Avoid a-clicking with your Zerglings. Rather, pick a target, move behind it to surround it, and then attack-move or target-fire the individual unit for a quick kill.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any Protoss player going for a Gateway Expand (the current metagame).  It is designed to do potentially game-winning damage against any player with sub-optimal building placement and Probe control.
However, it is significantly weaker against a Forge Fast Expanding player, for your Zerglings can only do damage where there are no Photon Cannons or wall-offs.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Extractor,Drone,Overlord,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn5Seconds,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MetabolicBoost,Queen,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:31 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'sOs DT-Robo Expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with the fastest possible Dark Templar in order to keep your opponent pinned in their base as well as some light harass, while you safely transition into a 2 base economy and either a Robotics or Blink focused play.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker back to the protection of your Mothership Core quickly if you have to defend an early attack. Hold on with Photon Overcharge until you can warp-in a DT to defend as well as harass.

This build is surprisingly safe against most openings, so scouting is pretty minimal.

Against standard Robo expand builds, your Nexus will be a little bit later.  You can make up for this either by using Warp Prism/DT harass or doing a Blink follow up to abuse their low production capability.

Against Blink play, simply take advantage of their lack of detection and kill a bunch of Probes. Against Dark Templar play, use your Observer and Stalker to push back their DTs while your(s) kill a bunch of Probes.

Against Stargate play, you might run into some problems. Phoenix will be able to scout what you are doing, and Oracles provide detection as well as harass potential.

Transitions

This build sets you up with a 2 base economy and both a Robotics Facility and Twilight Council. This lets you transition into either midgame Blink timings or Chargelot/Archon/Immortal macro play very easily.

To transition into Blink play, start and chronoboost Blink from your Twilight Council as soon as your first Dark Templar is warped in. Go up to 5 Gateways on 2 Assimilators and warp-in Blink Stalkers non-stop at your opponents base in order to punish typically greedy play in reaction to DT expand builds.

To transition into Chargelot/Archon/Immortal play, start Immortal production, a Forge, and go up to 3 Gateways. Once you are safely in the midgame, start Charge and be sure to out-expand your opponent.

Tips

- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial Stalker to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Traps 3gate All-in).
- You may want to proxy 2 Pylons with this build. One for the initial hidden Dark Shrine. The second for a close warp-in location for your initial DT.
- Un-chronoboosted Warpgate will time out perfectly with your Dark Shrine finishing
- Against Stargate play, be sure to position your initial units to defend your mineral line from potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- In the midgame, spend all of your Chronoboost on either the Robotics Facility or Twilight Councildepending on your transition.

Pros and Cons

This build is a reasonably safe build that allows you harass potential as well as forces your opponent to stay at home. It also expands at a normal time in order to get to the midgame quickly and transition smoothly into either a fast timing or macro play.

This hyper-aggressive 3gate all-in opens with a Gateway on 10 supply in order to get the fastest Warpgate Research possible. It then hits a ridiculously early (@5:30ish) 3gate attack in order to end the game before leaving the early game.

Scouting

This build requires very minimal scouting, for you are placing your initial Gateway at 10 supply?long before any scouting information could influence your build. However, it is critical to send a Probe out to set up proxy Pylon(s) BEFORE your Warpgate is done. Thus, probe scouting to check whether your opponent has opened with a 3 Stalker Rush in order to deny proxy Pylons can yield useful information.

Transitions

This build is an all-in in every respect: getting a 10 Gateway, non-stop chronoboosting Warpgate, halting Probe production at 16 (on minerals), and dumping all money into Gateway units. Thus, there is no well-defined transition. If you are late in your execution and do not outright kill your opponent (or at least take out their army and 10+ Probes), then you will most likely lose the game to any sort of Robotics/Twilight/Stargate counter-attack.

Tips

- Use only 1 Chronoboost on Probes (as you resume Probe production after your 10 Gateway).
- Use 1 Chronoboost on your Zealot in order to finish it as your Cybernetics Core finishes.
- ALL THE REST OF YOUR CHRONOBOOST MUST BE DUMPED INTO WARPGATE RESEARCH. The limiting factor on this build is how fast you can finish Warpgate. Be sure to non-stop chronoboost your Cybernetics Core until it finishes researching so as to attack as early as possible.
- There is a slightly more aggressive/less economic version of this build that opens with a 15 Zealot, 17 Pylon, and never chronoboosts the Zealot. That build and this build can be used interchangeably based on personal preference.
- Place your proxy Pylons quite aggressively for your attack to hit as fast as possible, unless you need to hide your proxy Pylon from a 3 Stalker rushing player.
- Commit to the attack as quickly as possible and never stop warping-in Zealots and Stalkers until either you have won the game or you have lost all of your units. The strength of this all-in is how quickly and ferociously it attacks, but if you are not constantly attacking then your opponent?s economic/tech advantage can destroy you.

Pros and Cons

This build is a hyper-aggressive all-in that is able to get 5 Stalkers and 1 Zealot warped-in at your opponent?s base at 5:30. Because of how quickly this build attacks, it can punish most greedy PvP builds with ease.
Unfortunately, this all-in is quite easy to scout because you cannot hide the fact that you are getting your first Gateway and Cybernetics Core much earlier than the normal timing. However, it being easy to scout and easy to defend are two fundamentally different things, so you can still win with this build quite often.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Pylon,Zealot,Chronoboost,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Stalker,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:31 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'TaeJa 1-1-1 Cloakshee', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This aggressive build used by Liquid`TaeJa and many other top level Korean Terrans opens with a very standard Banshee build adapted to Heart of the Swarm and the cheaper Banshee Cloak upgrade. The Banshees are used to stay safe against early attacks as well as harass your opponent.

This build is VERY closely related to Polts Gas First Banshee Build  TaeJas version is just a Barracks first variant of Polts build.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your 1st Refinery to check whether or not your opponent is opening with Reapers. Against an opponent opening Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe; thus, you should try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or expanded at your natural with your first few Marines.

Your next scout will come with your Banshee. With this Banshee, you can check what your opponents opener is. Against another Banshee player, follow-up your first Banshee with a Raven (and then potentially Viking if extra anti-air is needed). Against a Hellbat dropping player, make a few Widow Mines to burrow defensively against any incoming drop, as you use several Banshees to out-harass him. Against a player going for a Widow Mine Drop, position your Marines defensively at home and be sure to have enough scans to deal with his Widow Mines. Building a Raven might be useful, but not until after you have 2 Banshees with which to harass your opponent.

Finally, be sure to keep an eye out on what midgame transition your opponent is doing. Look for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either all-in, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play quite easily.

For an all-in transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory and start Siege Tank production instantly. When you hit 2 or 3 Siege Tanks, grab all of your Marines (>20), your Banshees/Vikings, and attempt to break your opponents front with a slow siege push.

It is possible to go into Marine/Tank or Mech after a 3 Command Center follow-up if you are sure your opponent will not be going for any more early game pressure. Start a Raven in order to save enough minerals to afford 2 Command Centers and then transition into either Marine/Tank or Mech just as below.

When transitioning into macro Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production after you start a 2nd Command Center. That way you have enough defense early and later can have a strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy Siege Tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use.
- Watch for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop your Banshee as you enter your opponents base.  Cloak your Banshee as soon as you see any potential for burrowed Widow Mines.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that are undefended by a Turret.  If you are transitioning to a 1/1/1 all-in, then be sure to target-fire Marines as well.
- Always favor keeping your Banshee(s) alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two. You can also repair a weakened Banshee at home with SCVs if you can keep it alive.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural. You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This build is a standard, aggressive opener in TvT that both scouts and stays safe in the early game. Also, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for you are able to transition into an all-in, 3 Command Center play, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play. Also, this build requires a lot less APM than other TvT builds, so it can be very useful for lower league players.

However, this build is not quite as effective at killing workers as a Widow Mine Drop into Banshee build. Also, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind your opponent in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades, especially if they open with a fast expansion. Finally, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,Factory,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Refinery,SCV,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Starport,ReactorOnBarracks,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,CallMule,SCV,LandStarportOnTechLab,CloakingField,DoubleMarines,Banshee,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:31 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'TLO 2 Base Muta', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with an economic 2 base Muta opener, and uses a 7:20 Overlord scout coupled with the initial Mutalisk harass to determine whether your Terran opponent is using a Bio-based composition, or a Mech-based composition.

Scouting

Scout first with your 2 initial Zerglings, use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of the Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of force very early, you will probably need emergency Spine Crawlers ? your Metabolic Boost will only be finishing around 8:20!
Your next scout will be with an Overlord as soon as your Lair finishes (around 7:05).  With this scout, aim to check if your opponent is playing Mech or Bio. Seeing any of the following can indicate Mech play: an Armory, more than 1 Factory, a Factory with Tech Lab, a lack of Barracks, or a lack of add-ons on Barracks. Seeing any of the following can indicate Bio play: 2 Engineering Bays, a Barracks with a researching Tech lab, more than 1 Barracks, or only one Factory.  If you scout Bio, you can still continue with a 2 base Spire timing and transition into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk OR you can abort the 2 base Spire timing and throw down 2 Evolution Chambers as soon as possible for +1/+1 Melee/Carapace upgrades.
The next scout will be with your initial Mutalisks. Terran will be forced to defend himself with his units, so you?ll see either Bio or Mech units to defend. These Mutalisks should be able to get into his main quite easily and scout what type of production he is using, perhaps even doing some economic damage.

Transitions

If you confirm Mech play with your Mutalisks, throw down an Infestation Pit. If you are sure he is going Mech before your Mutalisks arrive, then you can even place the Infestation Pit as soon as your Mutalisks hatch. Add more bases and Swarm Hosts when you can afford them.  Swarm Hosts are a strong option as your initial Mutalisks will likely force Turrets, Thors, and Widow Mines?units that are generally not strong against Swarm Host play. Alternatively, you can go into Overlord Speed and drop-play, to abuse the lack of Terran mobility. Finally, you can also place your Hive as soon as possible and go for a follow-up Brood Lord transition.
If you confirm Bio play with your Mutalisks, throw down 2 Evolution Chambers and a Baneling Nest as soon as possible. Note that you will be behind in upgrades against a 3 base macro Terran player, but you can recuperate this loss by aiming to snipe a key Tech lab researching Stimpack or Combat Shields, as this can prevent Terran from being aggressive with his upgrade lead. Good creep spread and strong engagements/burrowed Banelings can also mitigate this upgrade deficit. Once you hit the lategame, you have the option to transition into your preferred Hive tech.

Tips

- If you place a 5:00-5:30 Spine Crawler, you should be able to stop Hellions made from a Factory started before your opponent?s 2nd base. A 6:00-6:30 Spine Crawler will finish in time to stop Hellions made after your opponent?s 2nd base or Hellions made after a Reaper opener.
- Just when your Lair finishes (7:20ish), ideally you should be fully saturated on your 2 bases with extra minerals going into additional Drones. However, there are a couple of defensive options available if you are under pressure: If you have extra Drones and want to completely deter Hellion runbys, then make a wall-off with 2 Evolution Chambers and your Spine Crawler at the front of your natural.This will not slow down your Mutalisk timing as long as you remain fully saturated on all mineral lines and Extractors. Alternatively, you also have the ability to make a large group of Zerglings (only if you need to defend yourself) without hurting the timing of the Mutalisks. Note that you should only do this if you absolutely have to because droning should always be a priority. Remember that Metabolic Boost will only finish around 8:20, so any Zerglings made before this point should be used strictly for defense.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against Mech players. The initial Mutalisks will force extra Missile Turrets, Thors, and Widow Mines ? units that are all not ideal against the large mass of Swarm Hosts that you should follow-up with.
If you scout your opponent opening Bio with your Mutalisk timing, then you can transition into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk. The obvious problem here is that you will be behind on upgrades, but again this is not game-ending provided you get strong, cost-efficient engagements on creep. Also, this build is vulnerable to large Marine attacks in the early-game because you will not have Metabolic Boost yet to defend them. Hopefully, however, you can scout this coming with your initial Zerglings and/or Overlord in order to stay safe with Spine Crawlers.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Queen,Overlord,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Lair,Extractor,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,MetabolicBoost,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Spire,Overlord,Overlord,Hatchery,Queen,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,SpawnCreepTumor,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:31 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Taeja Autoturret Doom Drop', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

Though it has fallen out of popularity, this once dominant build still remains as powerful as ever. Utilizing a gas first opening to stay safe against an opponents gas first aggression, this build gets a fast two Medivacs to violently drop 8 Marines, 2 Siege Tanks, and 3 Auto Turrets in a critical position of the enemys base.

Scouting

Taeja chooses only to scout with his Hellion, preserving all his SCVs for maximum income. At times, he cannot afford continuous Marine or SCV production in the demonstration replay; had he SCV scouted he would be even more pushed for minerals.

SCV scouting is definitely an option if you do not feel safe enough with the delayed hellion scout, but it should be relegated to a 4:30 scout at the very earliest so as to not delay your Starport in any way.

Transitions

This build can transition into both Bio or Mech. Because you have made no major investments down either tech path, and you have exactly one of each necessary production structure, you can literally go into whatever style you want.

Tips

Against a live resisting opponent, execution of this build may run into some problems. They could be opening banshees; forcing Turrets to be made just before you move out. They could be doing the exact same build, resulting in a base trade. They could be doing earlier aggression that pins you in your base for longer than youd like, such as an elevator attack or a doom drop.

There are reactions to each of these plays, and there are far too many to list here. Regardless of what happens though, sometimes it is important to identify that you are more ahead simply by staying home and defending, and not to blindly commit to the attack every single game. This will come by experience and repeatedly executing the build.

Three main consistencies must be maintained;

1) You MUST continue unit production behind this attack; you cannot start a big transition (adding on Barracks/Factories while freezing production by constructing addons) else you will be extremely vulnerable to a counter attack. The only exception is when you know with certainty that your opponent will not be performing some sort of counterattack (for example, he has gone 3 Barracks into delayed Factory, or he has gone for a elevator and youve already killed the medivacs beforehand).

2) Once your autoturrets are dropped, its almost always a good idea to fly the Raven home; it will prove useful in the mid game.

3) If they made Banshees, you have to make turrets before moving out, else risk losing the game. Delay this to the last possible moment, as you are already pressed for cash.

Pros and Cons

The lethality of this build cannot be understated; you can simply win most games with this drop, especially against players who have gone for more macro oriented builds, such as a Reaper FE or a 15 gas style.

Unfortunately, if your opponent identifies your build quickly enough and prepositions his units properly, or employs defensive AOE such as Tanks or Widow Mines, your drop may end up doing little to no damage, and you can easily die to a counter push or drop.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,SCV,Factory,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Starport,Refinery,SCV,TechLabOnFactory,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,Hellion,SCV,LandStarportOnTechLab,Raven,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,LiftStarportFromTechLab,LandFactoryOnTechLab,SiegeTank,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,Medivac,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SiegeTank,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Medivac,SCV,OrbitalCommand', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:31 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Twilight All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Forge Fast Expand and then utilizes everything the Twilight Council has to offer in order to all-in your opponent. This two base all-in gets +2 attack, DTs, and mass Blink Stalkers to crush your opponent before the late game.

Scouting

After any early game shenanigans are ruled out, as you have spotted your opponent?s third Hatchery going down, then there is no need for any scouting besides what you see with your two pokes.

When you move out with your first 3 units (Zealot, Stalker, and Mothership Core), go to Zerg?s third base and see if you can pick off a queen and force some units. If your opponent reveals that he has Roaches already, then instantly pull back and stay behind your wall until your next poke with the DTs.  Expect a Roach defense vs your Blink Stalkers. If your opponent only shows slow Zerglings, then know that your opponent delayed gas and most likely has a larger economy than normal. Expect a lot more units vs your Blink Stalkers. If your opponent shows Speedlings, then pull back and stay behind your wall until your next poke with the DTs. Expect a Roach/Ling or Hydra/Ling defense vs your Blink Stalkers.

When you send your DTs to each base of your opponent, be on the look out for what units he has to defend, or what tech structures he has built. Your push is just about to happen, so it is too late to react in any way, but it is nice to know what units you will be up against before you are actually fighting them head on.

Transitions

This build is an all-in, so there is no true transition out of it. Simply keep reinforcing with your +2 Blink Stalkers (chronoboost your Gateways when you can) until your opponent is forced to leave or your army gets crushed.

If you do not win, but see that your opponent has way too much Roach or Hydra or Roach/Hydra for you to defeat, consider falling back onto a 3rd Nexus, and starting double Robotics Colossi production as a desperation move.

Tips

- Spend all of your early game chronoboost on your Nexii to maximize Probe production.
- Because you are getting your +1 Attack so early, there is no need to chronoboost it very often. Prioritize Probes instead.
- Do not over commit with your first three units. The Zealot can be killed, but if at all possible, retreat with your Stalker and Mothership Core still alive.
- Hide the Twilight Council (and later Dark Shrine) somewhere in your base that is less likely to be scouted by an Overlord.
- Keep a Probe hidden somewhere on the map before you are ready to move out. Being able to place a nice proxy Pylon for the DTs and then later Stalker warp-ins can be the difference between an easy win and a tough loss.
- Obviously, during the fight itself, utilize Blink to save the weakest Stalkers and keep your army alive.

Pros and Cons

This build is a solid all-in that utilizes everything the Twilight Council has to offer. It is a 1-2-3 punch sort of build, first hitting with your initial 3 units, then the DTs, and then the Blink Stalkers, so it keeps Zergs on their toes.

However, because this build is so reliant on the Twilight Council, your opponent flying in an overlord and spotting this will tip them off to everything that you are building; it is very easy to scout (Note: just because it is easy to scout does NOT mean it is easy to defend). Also, it is an all-in, so assuming you do not succeed in crushing your opponent with the Blink Stalkers, there is very little chance you have of coming back into the game. Finally, because this build packs a 1-2-3 punch, it is a more mechanically difficult build than other choices and is not suggested for newer players.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,GoOutProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Nexus,Forge,Pylon,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Chronoboost,PhotonCanon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,GroundWeaponsLevel1,Zealot,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,MothershipCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Stalker,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,TwilightCouncil,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Blink,DarkShrine,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,GroundWeaponsLevel2,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInDarkTemplar,WarpInDarkTemplar,WarpInDarkTemplar,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:31 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'YoDa Repaer FE into Mine Drop to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE opens with a strong economy, and then transitions into constant harass with a Widow Mine drop follow-up.

Scouting

This build is reasonably safe against most your opponent can open with as long as you are smart with your two Reapers.  Use them for scouting by poking at your opponents front in order to determine what your opponent can or cannot be doing as well as potentially killing a Marine or SCV.  Against Reaper play, keep your Reapers more defensively positioned.

Transitions

This build can transition into Marine/Tank or Mech very easily. However you cannot transition into Bio/Hellbat because you have not invested any time into getting the early game Bio upgrades.

When transitioning into Marine/Tank, start your tank production soon, using the Widow Mines and Reapers to stay safe as well as apply pressure. As your Medivac is moving out, swap your Barracks onto the Factorys Reactor and start double Marine production, add on a Tech lab onto your Factory to start Siege Tank production, and build two more Barracks and a third Refinery as soon as you can afford it to complete your 2 base infrastructure.

When transitioning into Mech, again you must rely on the Widow Mines and Reapers to stay safe and apply pressure, but this time back at home you must be playing greedily. You can dump your money into a 3rd base while your Medivac is moving out. Once youve started 3 bases, getting 2 more Factories, all your Refineries, and a decent Siege Tank count is your obvious next move. YoDa likes to also make a Tech lab on his Starport to get Ravens, but this is a stylistic choice that you dont have to make.

Pros and Cons

This build is great because it gives you a good economy and gives you lots of map control with the early game Reapers/Widow Mines. The harass you can apply is incredibly effective if you split up your Widow Mines effectively throughout your opponents base.

However, it is somewhat vulnerable to Banshee play, so be sure to position your Widow Mines defensively against Banshees. Also, with poor Medivac control, you can very easily lose your Medivac and all the Widow Mines if you fly directly into a Viking or Marine pack. Be sure to prioritize keeping the Medivac alive above all else.

This build uses a fast +1 Carapace upgrade to secure a fast 3rd Base and deny opposing 3rds before it transitions into a swift +1/+1 Speed Roach timing and eventual +2/+1.

Scouting

In the early stages of the game, all scouting comes from Overlord vision, so be sure that you send your initial 2 Overlords towards your opponent?s natural expansion. You can use your Overlord to compare his Hatchery?s HP to yours, to determine what kind of opener he used. If his hatchery is stronger than yours, he has gone hatchery first. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is the same HP as yours, he has VERY LIKELY done the same build as you. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is weaker to yours, he has gone for a gas and pool before hatchery in some order, meaning his speed is quicker than yours. Banelings before speed in this scenario is often advised, and likely make the Baneling nest in the main to not lose your Baneling tech to mass Zerglings with speed. An alternative is to not use your Gas, and get extra Queens and 2-3 Spine Crawlers. The main theme here is to not get Speed first, as his WILL be quicker. You need to find an edge that isn?t using Zergling Speed.
When playing versus any very early aggression (<10 pool), use your Drones to defend until you have your own Zerglings, a Queen, and potentially a Spine Crawler. Consider canceling the Hatchery for more minerals. Also use your initial overlord to scout when your opponent is taking their natural Hatchery. Feel free to apply some light pressure with your first Zerglings against a Hatch first build, but do not let it mess up your macro.
Make sure you have 2 to 4 Zerglings out on the map at all times. Send your initial 2 Zerglings to your opponent?s base to spot what they have at the front, and if possible get into the main with 1 Ling to see whether your hatching Drones or Zerglings from their eggs. Use the scouting intel that these pokes give you to determine whether you should get Banelings and extra Zerglings to defend yourself or pressure your opponent, or whether you should continue droning.
If your scout Zerglings see Drones hatching, and no wall at the front, you can choose to make Drones OR Zerglings to pressure. If you scout Zerglings, and no wall at the front, you should make the same amount of Zerglings. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings escape, send them back in to scout in 20~ seconds. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings die, remake the scout. Consider another 2 Zerglings for just-in-case Banelings. If you scout a wall, the Zerg is likely playing passive and you are likely safe.
As soon as you are sure you are safe, transition into your choice of tech.

Transitions

This has best synergy with a Hydralisk transition, which is possible after taking gas numbers 5 and 6 at your third base, although you could flood earlier Speedlings with +1 Carapace. However, you have the option of simply researching +1 Melee upgrades to transition into upgraded Speedlings, which is excellent against Mutalisk openers, or even going for a delayed Spire.

Tips

If your opponent is also going for a Roach based composition, remember that Roach Battles are mostly determined by macro and concaves. The superior concave will allow a smaller force to defeat a larger one, for the most part ? this is because more Roaches can fight in a larger concave, although you can also rush forward to allow the ones in the back to attack.
Against a Mutalisk based player, be sure to scout to see how many Mutalisks your opponent is making. If he is only making a few Mutalisks to dictate the pace of the game and force spores, you will probably be able to get away with only making Queens and Spores. If your opponent is heavily committing to Mutalisks, then consider incorporating Hydralisks and Infestors earlier than you normally would, in addition to the standard Queens and Spores. Spore Crawlers should also be placed to cover your Extractors, to ensure you do not fall behind tech wise. Do not be afraid to delay your Roach Timing if you are not sure how your opponent is going to play it out.
Against an upgraded Speedling force, delay your timing until you are maxed out. If your opponent invests very heavily into melee and carapace upgrades, they are almost certainly transitioning into an Ultralisk focused composition.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very flexible opener, which can combat greedier defensive play and also more aggressive play if your defensive micro is strong.
Because you are opening +1 Carapace Speedlings, taking and defending your third should relatively straightforward. Additionally, you have the opportunity of being reactive; the infrastructure you have at Lair level (+1 Carapace, Roach Warren, Metabolic Boost) allow you to choose between +1/+1 Speedlings, +1+1 Roaches, or even a slightly delayed Mutalisk transition.
However, this build by default will skip the Baneling nest in favor of faster upgrades and Lair Tech, so it is important to be on point with your scouting to avoid dying to enemy Baneling/Speedling aggression. If your scouting is poor, consider opening instead with the Safe Ling/Bling Opener, which will teach you what to look for and give you the tools to defend with.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Overlord,Extractor,Drone,Queen,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Queen,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,EvolutionChamber,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GroundCarapaceLevel1,Hatchery,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Lair,InjectLarva,RoachWarren,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Extractor,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GlialReconstitution,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 11:33:31 AM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '1 Rax FE into 2 Medivac Push', @SC2VersionID = '2.0.5', @Description = 'General Overview

This 1rax FE build gives you a strong economy, while staying safe from early Protoss pressure. It then transitions into a strong 10 minute push with +1 attack, Stim, Combat Shields, Concussive shells, and 2 Medivacs.

Scouting

When you send your scouting SCVs, you want to look for gasses, nexus energy, and the units he is producing out of his gateway. If he only has 1 gas before his stalker pops, check to see whether your opponent gets his natural at around 5:15 (You can hide your SCV nearby and then run it in around 5:30) to check for an expansion later if need be. If he has 2 gas and you don?t scout an expansion by 6:00, then be wary of an all-in. The common responses to standard Protoss plays are:
- Nexus First: Bunker rush with 4 Barracks instead of getting your 2nd CC OR Stop making marines at 3, get your 3rd CC and go straight into double upgrades to get a leg up in the macro game.
- Double Gas, No Expansion by 6:00: Get 3 bunkers (and a missile turret if you haven?t ruled out DTs). Pull SCVs to repair and provide a meat shield as necessary.
- 1 Gate Expand: Play normal.

Tips

- To confirm that your opponent is not allining you, have an SCV (or scan) go to his natural just before the 6 minute mark. A 4gate will hit before this timing, but 1 bunker and repair should be able to hold a 4gate easily enough; all other scary allins hit much later and this scout will give you enough time to prepare an appropriate defense.
- Unless you are expecting an allin of some sort, do not make marauders until you?ve started your starport. The 50 gas from making 2 marauders at a time will slow down the push by over a minute.
- Also related to this, you can push your medivac timing earlier by getting your factory before your barracks addons. Because you?re not making marauders just yet anyway, the only difference between getting the addons before factory vs getting them after is that you cut a couple of marines and get a faster medivac timing. Both versions are totally valid.
- Once you have your first marauder out, take your own watchtower by scaring away or killing his stalker ? up until you get a marauder out, you have to stay behind your bunker for defense.
- When you attack with your first 2 medivacs, be sure to scan your opponent?s natural in order to determine how much stuff/how many sentries he has waiting for you. If your opponent has too many units, then double drop the main instead of attacking directly into the natural.  Do NOT engage in chokes against sentries.

Transitions

As you?re pushing out, you will need to place down your 3rd CC, 2nd engibay and armory, 2 more rax, and a ghost academy or 2nd starport to counter your opponent?s HTs or collosi. If you?re feeling safe, then place down the 3rd CC and engibay first. If you?re worried about not having enough units, get the 2 more rax earlier, as well as possibly your ghost academy or 2nd starport before 3rd. Transition into 3 base bio with ghosts/vikings when you have the money.

Pros and Cons

This is probably the most standard 1rax FE. Compared to the other variants, it gives you reasonably timed infrastructure, a very safe opening against most 1 base and early 2 base Protoss all-ins, and of course the exact same economy as the other 1rax FEs.  However, early on you have no map control at all because of how well early stalkers can deal with naked marines in the open field; you don?t get up your 3rd CC extremely fast; and you don?t get up your 5 barracks up as quickly as Bomber?s build.
Other TvP builds, besides the 1rax FE variants, should also be considered. This build gives you a lot smaller army and much later upgrades than MKP?s 2rax early on, in exchange for a much stronger economy and a solid timing attack with Medivacs at around the 10 minute mark. Also, it gives you more scans and SCVs to pull to deal with early DTs and/or pressure. While the 2rax will attack early and hit hard with continued aggression, the 1rax FE will give you a much more powerful attack later on, in exchange for leaving you more vulnerable against the early aggression Protoss can lay on.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,CommandCenter,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,Bunker,Marine,SCV,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Refinery,Refinery,SCV,Marine,CallMule,Marine,Marine,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,Marine,SCV,SCV,Marine,SupplyDepot,StimPack,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Marine,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Factory,EngineeringBay,Refinery,Marine,Marine,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,CombatShield,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Marauder', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:26:59 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '2 Rax Reaper FE to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with 2 Barracks to produce a lot of Reapers very quickly.  It is a great way to get complete map control with 4 Reapers, apply heavy pressure to an expanding opponent, and transition into standard Bio play.  This 2rax Reaper build also can instantly win against some Gas First or CC First builds.

Scouting

This build is a reasonably safe build against most things Terran can open with as long as you are smart with your initial four Reapers. Thus, SCV scouting early on is not required or even suggested. Use your Reapers to take map control and pick off Marines/scout the front. However, there may come a time when your opponent has a Bunker up and you can no longer poke the front. Then, while prioritizing keeping your Reapers alive over all else, jump into his base and pick off SCVs/continue to scout.

If you scout your opponent opening Banshee, then cease Reaper productioninstead, favor making Marines and getting an earlier Engineering Bay. If you scout a Widow Mine Drop, then be wary of your opponents Medivac, and hole up in your main base until you have enough units to stabilize. If you scout a Marine/Tank/Banshee all-in, then keep your 2nd Command Center in your main base and play defensive. If you scout a 1rax FE, then scout for the Bio or Mech follow-up, and apply pressure whenever possible.

Note: If you scout your opponent going Mech, then add a 2nd Tech lab instead of Reactor on your initial Barracks and build some marauders too.  You can still follow the same basic build order, but you will have a little less gas than normal, so you might need to get early gas geysers than what is written up above.

Transitions

This build commits too much into Infantry upgrades for you to transition into Mech. However, it transitions quite smoothly into Marine/Tank or pure Bio (vs Mech).

For a Marine/Tank transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory for Siege Tank production, take your third base, start your 4th-6th gas geysers, and start another Engineering Bay+Armory for more upgrades. With your midgame push, confirm what unit composition your opponent is going, and play aggressively/passively accordingly.

For a pure Bio transition (if your opponent is playing Mech), start another Engineering Bay and Armory to continue your upgrades as you take your 3rd Command Center and keep your opponent pinned back. Threaten boosted Medivac drops whenever possible, but do not over commit your army if your opponent has an adequate defense.

Pros and Cons

This build is a safe build that also opens aggressively. With this build, you can pick off Marines and SCV, while simultaneously getting a full scout of your opponents base and stressing their multitasking. This build also has a heavy Marine follow up, and can deal with Banshees or 1/1/1 all-ins rather well due to the Reactor/Tech lab first. This transitions into normal Bio play but gives you the advantage due to early harass and map control.

However, this build performs poorly against early Hellion openings. If you scout Reactored Hellions, cease Reaper production instantly and transition into faster Marine/Marauder production. Also, if your opponent holds the Reapers cost-effectively with a 1rax FE or CC First (either due to you mis-microing, or them having a solid defense), then you will be behind going into the midgame economically.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,Barracks,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Reaper,SCV,SCV,Reaper,Reaper,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Barracks,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,CallMule,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,Marine,CombatShield,SCV,Marine,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Refinery,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,Factory,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,EngineeringBay,StimPack,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SCV,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,CallMule,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marine,CallMule,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,LiftFactoryFromReactor,TechLabOnFactory,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:27:00 PM;

VortiX uses a gasless opening and transitions into a strong Roach Zergling timing, aiming to punish greedier Roach play or swift Mutalisk play.

Scouting

n the early stages of the game, all scouting comes from Overlord vision, so be sure that you send your initial 2 Overlords towards your opponent?s natural expansion. You can use your Overlord to compare his Hatchery?s HP to yours, to determine what kind of opener he used. If his hatchery is stronger than yours, he has gone hatchery first. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is the same HP as yours, he has VERY LIKELY done the same build as you. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is weaker to yours, he has gone for a gas and pool before hatchery in some order, meaning his speed is quicker than yours. Banelings before speed in this scenario is often advised, and likely make the Baneling nest in the main to not lose your Baneling tech to mass Zerglings with speed. An alternative is to not use your Gas, and get extra Queens and 2-3 Spine Crawlers. The main theme here is to not get Speed first, as his WILL be quicker. You need to find an edge that isn?t using Zergling Speed.
When playing versus any very early aggression (<10 pool), use your Drones to defend until you have your own Zerglings, a Queen, and potentially a Spine Crawler. Consider canceling the Hatchery for more minerals. Also use your initial overlord to scout when your opponent is taking their natural Hatchery. Feel free to apply some light pressure with your first Zerglings against a Hatch first build, but do not let it mess up your macro.
Make sure you have 2 to 4 Zerglings out on the map at all times. Send your initial 2 Zerglings to your opponent?s base to spot what they have at the front, and if possible get into the main with 1 Ling to see whether your hatching Drones or Zerglings from their eggs. Use the scouting intel that these pokes give you to determine whether you should get Banelings and extra Zerglings to defend yourself or pressure your opponent, or whether you should continue droning.
If your scout Zerglings see Drones hatching, and no wall at the front, you can choose to make Drones OR Zerglings to pressure. If you scout Zerglings, and no wall at the front, you should make the same amount of Zerglings. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings escape, send them back in to scout in 20~ seconds. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings die, remake the scout. Consider another 2 Zerglings for just-in-case Banelings. If you scout a wall, the Zerg is likely playing passive and you are likely safe.
As soon as you are sure you are safe, transition into your choice of tech.

Transitions

However, because you have not yet committed upgrades to either Ranged or Melee, you can choose between transitioning into Roach Hydra or Ling Ultra.
If you do choose to go for Roaches, immediately research Roach Speed and take your third, while droning as heavily as you can without endangering yourself. You can transition to a similar midgame to that of Vortix?s 3 Base Speed Roach, albeit without the fast upgrades.
It is not recommended you go for a Mutalisk transition.

Tips

Aim to focus down Queens with transfuse energy first, and use Roaches to tank any Baneling hits. Emphasize surrounds with your Speedlings and tank Banelings with your Roaches.

Pros and Cons

This build excels and punishing either greedier Roach players, and players rushing for Mutalisks. If it fails, you are behind as with any timing attack. You do not have any tech, you have no upgrades, and you will almost certainly be behind in drones. Additionally, because you are opening gasless, your defense is likely to be much more difficult. You will have no Banelings or Zergling speed, so your defense will revolve entirely around Spine Crawlers, Queens, and building placement.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Queen,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Drone,RoachWarren,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Extractor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,SpawnCreepTumor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,SpawnCreepTumor,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,SpawnCreepTumor', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:27:00 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '2 Reactored Rax Reapers', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This mass Reaper build order gets 2 Reactored Barracks cranking out 4 Reapers at a time in order to overwhelm your opponent with purely mass Reaper.

Scouting

There is minimal SCV scouting with this build because you will open the same regardless of what your opponent is making. The majority of your scouting comes from your constant Reaper attacks.

Against anything but Banshees, constantly produce Reapers to overwhelm your opponent. Against Banshees, be sure to cancel your Reaper production and start producing 4 Marines at a time. If you have done significant economic damage, then getting an Engineering Bay for a Missile Turret is not a bad idea either.

Transitions

This build actually transitions pretty well into a decent midgame for being an all-in. However, you can only transition into Bio after opening with this build because it is hard to utilize your quick Reactors and two Barracks early on if you are trying to transition into Mech. When you feel like you cannot do any more damage with your Reapers, be sure to stop Reaper production and begin your Bio upgrades.

For a standard Bio follow-up, get your natural expansion, start Marine production, and get a 3rd Barracks with a Tech lab. This way you can start Stimpack, an Engineering Bay, Factory, and 3rd Refinery all at the same time just like as if you had opened with a normal 1rax FE into Medivacs.

For a fast upgrade transition, start your natural expansion, Marine production from the 2 Barracks, 2 Engineering Bays, and then +1/+1. As soon as you can, get one more Barracks with a Tech lab so that you can start researching Stimpack. Then, you can take your third Refinery and get a Factory to go into Reactored Medivacs and +2/+2.

For a follow-up timing attack, start your natural expansion, Marine production, and a Factory instantly.  Get a Tech lab on the Factory and start Siege Tank production in order to hit a very fast Marine/Tank push with your second Siege Tank. Behind this contain/attack, you can get your 3rd base, 3rd and 4th Refineries, double Engineering Bays, and 2 or 3 more Barracks (get Stimpack and Combat Shields).

Execution

As soon as your first Reapers pop, start being aggressive. Your number one goal is to deny your opponents Factory for as long as possible (Hellions or Widow Mines can be difficult to maneuver around), but in order to do this, you have to be in your opponents face with your Reapers as soon as they are built. Also, with your constant harass, be sure to dwindle your opponents Marine count without committing too hard and losing any Reapers.

Your Reaper count increases very quickly, and when you get around 6 to 8 Reapers, you can truly overwhelm most units your opponent can have.  Thus, focus on killing his army with your initial Reapersyou will be able to kill his SCVs once his army is dead.

In general, if your opponent sees what you are doing, you are in trouble.  Thus, it is suggested that at least one of your Barracks is build outside your base (even just at your natural will sometimes work fine). However, you can proxy both Barracks outside your main to make this build a little more all-in too. This also works for some mind games because if your opponent scouts you with a Refinery but no Barracks in your main, he will most likely try to defend proxy Marauders (a defense that is awful on most maps against mass Reaper).

Pros and Cons

This build is very aggressive and can catch many opponents off-guard.  With a hilarious amount of Reapers, you are usually able to overwhelm their army within the first 8 minutes. However, even if the all-in does fail, it can still transition into a 11-12 minute Bio+Stimpack/Medivac timing.

However, if you do not do much damage, you will be quite behind your opponent in tech (and possibly income). Also, this build can be easily scouted if an SCV sees both Reactors building before a single unit, so at least one of the Barracks must be proxied outside of your main.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Refinery,OrbitalCommand,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,DoubleReapers,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleReapers,SCV,DoubleReapers,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleReapers,DoubleReapers,CallMule,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:27:00 PM;

This build appears to be a standard Zerg opener to the untrained eye, but it actually can outright kill most unrefined Terran macro builds in the lower leagues.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. Do your best to stop your opponent from scouting how many Zerglings you are creating. The rest of your scouting will come from your Speedling timing attack. Check whether your opponent is going for a Bio, Mech, or 3CC play. You should at the least be able to force your opponent to lift off their natural unless they made a tight wall ? don?t commit your Speedlings into a meat grinder if your opponent has walled off successfully.

Transitions

As soon as you hit your attack, you need to be droning quite heavily to be able to stand any sort of chance going into the midgame. Only put Drones back in gas and re-begin teching up to Lair, Evolution Chambers, and Mutalisks once you are getting closer to 2 base Drone saturation.

Tips

- Be sure that you take map control with your initial Zerglings. Being able to deny your opponent vision of your building Zerglings will make this attack that much stronger.
- Do NOT attack into a Terran force behind a full wall-off. Force your opponent to abandon their natural and continue droning up.

Pros and Cons

This build looks like a standard ZvT build, but hits your opponent incredibly aggressively with a lot of early game Speedlings. This Speedling timing should either outright win the game or give you an effective economic advantage that will take you into the midgame. However, because you are cutting Drone production in order to support this swell of Zerglings, your economic situation will be much further behind than what you might be used to. If your opponent holds the attack without taking much damage at all, then it?s possible you will simply get rolled over by any sort of counterattack as you are attempting to make Drones.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Extractor,Drone,SpawningPool,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,StartIdle,StopIdleIn5Seconds,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Queen,MetabolicBoost,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:27:08 PM;

This classic 7 Roach Rush all-in is a great build for newer players to learn one base macro with. It hits a very quick timing that can crush through inexperienced or unsuspecting opponents.

Scouting

This build can be performed against any opener Terran has. The only scouting you need to do is send your initial 2 Overlords to your opponent?s base in order to spot both where your opponent is spawned and whether or not they have a Bunker or Marauders that you will have to break down or fight.

Transitions

This 7 Roach Rush build is a strong 1 base attack that opens with a lot of units and few Drones, so your follow-up will be very slow. That being said, you should start to float some minerals as you are reaching your opponent?s base, so start a natural Hatchery, build a lot more Drones, and get Metabolic Boost as soon as possible. Going for a Lair and getting a Banelings Nest in order to start a Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk composition is a strong way to deal with Terran in the midgame.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong 1 base attack that can crush your opponent early before they have their midgame even established. However, this build can be held off if your opponent scouts it and prepares with a repaired Bunker or Marauders if they have opened with a 1 base play of their own.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Alicia 12-12 Colossus All-In', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build utilizes an unconventional Gateway and gas timing to produce a fast Mothership Core for scouting before smoothly transitioning into a 2 Colossus All-in.

Attack your opponent when your 2nd Colossus finishes (@9:30ish) with 2 Colossi, 3 Stalkers, 3 Sentries, and a Mothership Core with about 45 Probes at home.

Scouting

Do not Probe scout with this build. Because you are using a 12/12 opening, you will have an extremely early Mothership Core for immediate scouting. Your Mothership Core should be directly rallied to the enemy base upon completion.

The early Mothership Core allows you to see exactly what a Terran is aiming for. If they are aiming for Factory aggression with a Starport simply chronoboost out 2 Observers, placing one in each base. Position your 3 Stalkers in the main to catch a drop. Bring your Mothership Core home and use it to defend the natural with Photon Overcharge. This defensive setup should allow you to defend any multi-pronged aggression from the Terran.

If it is merely a 2 base, 3 Barracks opener, then proceed as normal.

Transitions

As this is an all-in, the transitions for this build are heavily dependent on the damage you deal. If you kill a significant amount of workers but find yourself unable to finish your opponent off, transition into normal Blink/Colossus play. If you do not kill many workers and lose your army, then you most likely will lose to a follow-up counterattack. If you trade armies but do eventually lose your own, you are free to instantly transition into anything you wantBlink/Colossus, Chargelot/Archon, or Storm play are all equally viable. Remember to start 2 Forges and chronoboost your upgrades to catch up in the upgrade war.

Tips

Produce a third Colossus and leave it at home along with your Mothership Core. This allows you to effectively defend counter aggression with 2 Photon Overcharges. You have enough punch in your frontal push with Forcefield and Guardian Shield not to require Time Warp.

Only chronoboost your 10th and 13th Probe before the completion of your Cybernetics Core. You need to bank energy to allow you to simultaneously chronoboost your Mothership Core and first Stalker. Otherwise your scouting information is delayed and a Reaper can play havoc with your main.

Once you have completed your Mothership Core and initial Stalker, return to chronoboosting Probes until the completion of your Robotics Bay. At this point exclusively chronoboost Colossi. If you find you have spare Nexus energy chronoboost Thermal Lance but prioritize accelerating your Colossus count  your push begins once both Colossi have been completed.

Pros and Cons

This all-in is one of the most difficult to scout builds currently available to Protoss. To most Terran players it will look like standard macro play and may even prompt incorrect reactions such as earlier Medivac aggression or a fast 3rd Command Center. Also, because of the fast Mothership Core scout, you will almost always be able to identify Terrans early game build structure (3rax, 1/1/1, etc).

However, because your Mothership Core stays at home for defense and you have no upgrades to fall back on, your attack is fully all-inthere is no way to retreat your Colossus safely if your attack fails and you are certain to fall behind in upgrades as the game stretches on.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Stalker,Chronoboost,WarpgateUpgrade,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Assimilator,Stalker,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,Nexus,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Chronoboost,Stalker,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Observer,RoboticsBay,Assimilator,Assimilator,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,WarpInSentry,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Pylon,Probe,Probe,ExtendedThermalLance,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:27:10 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Bomber 2 Base 5 Rax Push', @SC2VersionID = '2.0.5', @Description = 'General Overview

This variant on the standard 1rax FE build gets the midgame infrastructure up much earlier for a lot of midgame aggression, while sacrificing early safety against one and early two base Protoss attacks.

Scouting

When you send your scouting SCV, look for the number of gasses your opponent has, their Nexus energy, and also the units they are producing out of the Gateway. If he only has 1 gas before his stalker pops, check to see whether your opponent gets his natural at around 5:15 (You can hide your SCV nearby and then run it in around 5:30 to check for an expansion later if need be). If he has 2 gas or is not spending his chronoboost, then be wary of any sort of early attack.

Tips

- To confirm that your opponent is not all-inning you, have an SCV (or scan) go to his natural just before the 6 minute mark.  A 4gate will hit before this timing, but 2 bunkers and repair should be able to hold a 4gate easily enough; all other all-ins hit much later and this scout will give you enough time to mount an appropriate defense.
- You cannot afford Marauders with this build until you start the Starport. The 100 extra minerals and 50 gas from making 2 Marauders at a time will slow down the push by over a minute.
- Take map control when you initially poke out with your first two Medivacs. Do NOT engage Protoss yet though. This build sets up your infrastructure for a lot of reinforcements, but does not increase your army size until those reinforcements have actually arrived.
- Once the first or second wave of units from all 5 Barracks have popped (you should be making 3 Marauders and 4 marines at a time), straight up fight Protoss? army. Spread your army, kite Zealots, pick up units trapped between forcefields and zealots with Medivacs, and dodge storms as best you can. However, do not forget to build reinforcing units, and do not stop the aggression unless you are forced to. During this aggression, you also get to see what army composition your opponent has.  Get a 4th Refinery.  Then react appropriately to Colossus by making Vikings (and possibly a 2nd Starport) and to High Templar by making Ghosts.

Transitions

During the fighting, place down your 3rd CC, 2nd Engineering Bay and Armory, and Ghost academy or 2nd Starport to counter your opponent?s HTs or Colossi. Fighting your opponent across the map forces them to reveal which tech path they?ve gone down and safely give you the time you need to counter it before it comes to your base.

Pros and Cons

This 1rax FE variant cuts many early-game corners compared to other 1rax FEs.  Delaying the 2nd Refinery means that you cannot afford any Marauders at all until after your Starport has been started. Thus, in case your opponent does an early-game attack, you have to rely on Bunkers and SCVs to repair and tank damage much more than you would in other builds. However, what this build lacks in the early game it more than makes up for in the mid game. Getting five Barracks up that fast means that you can apply a lot of midgame aggression against your opponent.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '3gate Proxy Oracle All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This micro-intensive build rushes for a proxy Stargate, and then pumps out Oracles to do damage to your opponents mineral line while simultaneously crushing through your opponents front with a strong Gateway+Mothership Core army.

Attack your opponents main mineral line with 1st Oracle as soon as it finishes (@6:15ish), and push at front with Zealot/Stalker/Mothership Core.

Scouting

This build is an all-in that makes a lot of units, so is safe in general vs an aggressive opponent  the only scouting you need to do is spot where your opponent has spawned and whether or not they have taken gas. If you are performing this build vs a gasless Terran, you can be much more aggressive with your initial 3 units and oracle. Versus a gassing Terran, you must be wary of Widow Mines, so be sure not to clump up your units when pushing up ramps or going into your opponents mineral line with your Oracles.

Transitions

This build is an all-in, so note that there is no clear transition out of it.  Continue making oracles (up to 3 or 4) and warping in Stalkers so that you can break the front. Note that if your opponent does eventually hold and you end up losing your entire army, then you are most likely behind both economically and in tech. Only expand and continue producing Probes once/if you break the front and you are just making sure that you have enough economy to follow up with a win.

Pros and Cons

This build hits very early with a proxied Oracle, taking advantage of the weakness of early game Marines without upgrades. This build is so strong because it gives you enough units to pressure both your opponents front and their mineral line simultaneously. It also then gives you the infrastructure needed to warp-in enough Gateway units to eventually bust down your opponents front.

However, this build is a very micro intensive build  you must be target firing with your Oracle in the main, while not losing any of the units in the front, usually for at least 3 minutes. It is also weak vs Widow Mines if you have poor control. Lastly, note that this build is in fact an all-in, so doing some damage but losing your entire army does put you behind by quite a bit.

Tips

- Chronoboost your initial Stalker so that you deny scouting from your opponent as soon as possible.
- Do not get your initial Probe trapped in your opponents base or killed, for that will force you to send another Probe to build the proxy Pylon and lose more mining time.
- You have to target fire individual SCVs for the Pulsar Beam to be most effective.
- One Oracle can take down 4 Marines if it has enough energy for Pulsar Beam the entire time.
- You can use the Oracles Envision spell for mobile detection in case your opponent has opened Widow Mine or Banshee.
- Be wary of Widow Mines both in the front or in the main mineral line and stay alert of the 40 second cooldown they have between shots.
- Dont forget to use the Mothership Cores Time Warp ability to help vs SCVs/marines in the attack at the front.
- Once/if you break the front, be sure to build an expansion and resume Probe production just in case your opponent does eventually hold.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Zealot,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Stargate,Gateway,Gateway,Oracle,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Oracle,Chronoboost,Pylon,Zealot,Zealot,Zealot,Oracle,Chronoboost,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,WarpInStalker,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:27:10 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '15 Gas Marine-Hellion Expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This fast expansion build created by Innovation uses Hellions to stay safe against Reapers, Banshees, and Hellbatsall while taking map control.

Scouting

Scouting with this build until you get your first Hellions out is not necessary.  However if you want to SCV scout, checking your opponents gas timing clues you in on what they could possibly be doing.

If your SCV sees that your opponent has mined more gas than you have, the most likely are opening with Reapers. However, even if you do not get into your opponents base, you can still tell a Reaper is coming by leaving your scout next to your opponents Barracks to spot whether it dies to a Marine or a Reaper. Your first 2 Marines positioned in your main at a Reaper jump-up spot, followed up by the Reactor for extra Marine production should crush any aggressive Reaper play if you react with and position your initial Marines well. With the Reactored Hellion follow-up you can seize map control and spot if there are any other pushes coming.

When your second Orbital Command finishes and you are still worried about a 1 base play, consider scanning your opponents main base.  Against 1 base play, be sure to have good vision around your base to prevent elevators and to defend your front with a Bunker. Also, a Missile Turret per mineral line with one Viking will shut down any Widow Mine Drops into Cloak Banshee openers. Lastly, if your opponent is going for Hellbat drops, then producing more than 6 Hellions and starting a Viking can be really helpful for your defensenormal Hellions do quite well against Hellbats, and Vikings do quite well at deterring Medivacs.

Execution

If your opponent invested more than 2 Reapers before expanding into bio play, then this is your cue to do heavy damage. If he played greedy and didnt build a bunker at his natural, you can go in with your 4 Hellions, 6 Marines and your first Medivac and kill his un-upgraded Marines. If there is a Bunker at the natural, then simply elevator your Marines and then Hellions into your opponents main and kill as many units as you can.

Against Mech play you might have to play a bit more conservative with your aggression because in Hellion vs Hellion fights, the player who was positioned correctly before the fight usually has the advantage. Instead of committing to an attack or elevator, pulling your army back and placing down a quick 3rd Command Center is a safer way to play.

Against standard Bio play, you can attempt to hit a Marine/Hellion timing at his front with your first 4 Hellions, 6 Marines, and a Medivac. Or, if your opponent is too well defended at the front, perform a 4 Hellion drop and harass his SCVs instead. Getting your 2nd Barracks and starting Stimpack before taking your 3rd Command Center is crucial to staying safe against 10 minute Bio timings and drop play. Alternatively, going Mech and producing Widow Mines/Siege Tanks as you take your third base is a strong way to stay safe as well.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into anything: Marine/Tank or Mech play. Note that as stated in the Execution section above, the follow-up you can do after you get your initial Marine/Hellion/Medivac army is completely dependent on your own preference and the play style of your opponent.

When transitioning into Bio play, against Mech and 3CC builds you can get away with starting your 3rd CC right away and following-up with 2 Barracks with Tech labs (to start Stimpack/Combat Shields), 3 Refineries, and 2 Engineering bays. Against more traditional Bio play it is necessary to start a Tech lab on your initial Barracks for a quicker Stimpack. Then, after taking a 2nd Refinery, you can build a 2nd Barracks onto the naked Reactor and start Siege Tank production to take yourself into the midgame. This is followed up by a 3rd Command Center (between 8:00-8:30), 1 more Barracks, both Refineries at your natural expansion, and 2 Engineering bays. Not having Stimpack completed in time for the inevitable 10ish minute drop play can be a game changer because with the new Medivacs boosting around your main and natural, it is very easy to get caught out of position and take a lot of damage for free.

ForGG does an interesting follow-up where he simply constantly produces Hellions  sometimes going up to 20+ Hellions  and overwhelms his opponents before they have Stimpack or enough Siege Tanks to deal with this attack. Mass Hellions are surprisingly good against opponents who make Hellbats or try drop play without a perfect follow-up.

Another possible follow-up is going for Mech play. This is easily achieved by keeping the Factory onto the Reactor for more Hellions, getting all 4 Refineries while starting more Factories, and starting your 3rd Command Center very quickly. Building some Vikings for drop defense will definitely come in handy as well.

Pros and Cons

This build defends early pressure quite easily, while getting a quick expansion and going into the midgame. Also, once your first Medivac is out, you hit your opponent with lots of pressure early on to kick start an aggressive game. Finally, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for opening with a 1/1/1 grants you the freedom to go into nearly anything.

However, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades. Also, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Factory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,Starport,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SCV,OrbitalCommand,SCV,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,Medivac', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:27:10 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '15 gas FE into Mine Drop to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reactored Rax FE gives you enough Marines to stay safe against early Protoss pressure, while still getting a fast expansion. Then it transitions into a fast Marine/Widow Mine drop to hit your opponent with some pressure of your own. Interestingly, this build can also transition into standard Bio play or macro Mech play.

Scouting

This build is largely safe against any early pressure that Protoss can apply because it gives you a Reactored Barracks to pump out Marines two at a time. Also, if you are feeling unsafe, you have the minerals after your reactor finishes to place down a Bunker at your natural. Also, if your opponent is doing a 1 base all-in, then instead of being aggressive with your Marines/Widow Mines, you can keep them in your main and defend your Bunker/main. By simply constantly producing Widow Mines, Marines, and Medivacs to keep replenishing your defenses, you can remain safe against most all-ins. However seeing the all-ins coming is crucial. Scouting your opponents natural expansion timing with an SCV is huge (if your opponent does not have an expansion started by around 5:30, expect an all-in). Besides seeing an all-in coming, the rest of your midgame scouting will come from seeing how your opponent defends the Widow Mine drop.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because it gets a good economy, but also enough Marines to defend early game Protoss pokes. Then, the Marine/Widow Mine drop gives you complete map control AND keeps your opponent in the dark as to what followup you are doing (Mech/Bio/3CC). Not to mention that if your opponent is not careful, this build can get Widow Mines in your opponents mineral lines and land some huge hits on Probes, essentially winning the game instantly.

However, this build is more vulnerable to later all-ins such as Void ray or Blink+Mothership core all-ins than more standard bio play (because you will not have stim yet), so be sure to position your Widow Mines defensively and add on more bunkers against a Protoss that you have scouted isnt expanding. Also, with poor Medivac control, you can very easily lose your Medivac and all the Widow Mines if you are not careful. Lastly, this build is not quite as economical as a 1rax FE build, but it still gets a pretty reasonably fast expand, so its not too far behind a 1rax FE build in terms of economy at all.

Tips

- Early game Stalker/Mothership Core pressure may be hard to deal with, but position your Marines effectively and hold on until you get out a Widow Mine in order to defend your base.
- Once you have pinned your opponent on an aggressive build (for instance, by scouting a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), do NOT move out; instead, posture your Widow Mines and Marines in an appropriately defensive position.
- Oracles flat out destroy marines, so if you are fighting an opponent going for Stargate, position your Widow Mines by the mineral line and even consider getting out one turret per base.
- When committing to an attack, boost in and drop one Widow Mine at your opponents main-to-natural ramp in order to trap his army on one half of his base. Once you have his ramp locked down, you will have several seconds of complete control of the half of his base where his army is not located. Use these seconds to kill workers and/or position a mine in a crucial location.
- Above all else, the strength of this build is non-stop harass/pressure.

You will be doing this build no matter what, so there is no SCV scouting.  The rest of your scouting will come from your Reapers seeing what your opponent has. However, an interesting SCV timing to note: you will reach a very nice proxy location with your SCV on most 2 person maps if you send it out exactly as you get 50 minerals for the first time at 8 supply.

Transitions

There is no defined transition from this build; it is basically all-in after all.  However, if your opponent goes for very quick roaches then you might want to add-on Tech labs and get Marauders. Besides that, you should have enough Reapers to evenly trade with anything your opponent can make, as long as you can stutter step appropriately.

Tips

- Do NOT lose any of your first 3 Reapers. They are the most important part of this build  applying the early pressure, forcing Drones to be pulled, and most importantly stopping Queens/Roaches from being made. If you lose them, you will most likely lose the game.
- Do not stop for Hatcheries or buildings of any kind. Go straight for the Drones and force some to be pulled off the worker line. If your opponent has their full economy up they will simply outproduce you.
- The only micro you have to do is stutter step against Zerglings/Drones, and pull back the weakest Reaper against Queens.
- 4 Reapers will kill a Queen without you losing a single one of them as long as you pull the targeted Reaper back in time.
- In order to hit the exact build order supplies above, you will have to cut some SCVs for several seconds. I highly recommend watching the tutorial replays (and using the Take Command button with a friend to see how you match up to it) until you get a hang of the build.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,GoOutScv,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,SCV,SCV,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,Reaper,Barracks,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Reaper,SCV,Reaper', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:27:10 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '15 Gas Raven Expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This fast expansion build created by Maru uses a lot of scouting in order to stay safe against Reapers and Banshees, getting out enough Marines and the infrastructure needed to defend all sorts of aggression that early-game TvT can have.

Scouting

Figuring out your opponents opening so that you can react appropriately when you are performing this build is crucial. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that you SCV scout around 12 or 13 supply in order to see whether your opponent has opened gas first or not.

If your SCV gets into your opponents base and sees that your opponents Barracks is delayed compared to yours, you know that they are opening gas first  the most likely scenario being Polts Gas First Banshee Build.  However, there are some Gas First Hellion openers, so stick around until the first Marine pops so that you can see what add-ons your opponent is making. A fast Tech lab usually will be swapped off onto the Starport for a fast Banshee. A fast Reactor can be used to swap off and go for Hellions.  Against Hellion play, build your Command Center and keep your Marines on the high ground.

If you get into your opponents base and see that your opponent has mined more gas than you have, the most likely scenario is that they are opening with Reapers. Note that even if you do not get into your opponents base, you can still tell a Reaper is coming by leaving your scouting SCV next to your opponents Barracks to spot whether the first unit to pop out is a Marine or a Reaper. Against Reaper play, build your Command Center and position your Marines on the high ground. If your opponent commits to 2rax Reaper or Mass Reaper play, transitioning into Innovations Marine/Hellion Expand to stay safe (instead of taking a 2nd gas and instantly opening with a Starport) is a common reaction. With the Reactored Hellion follow-up you can seize map control and deal with Reapers quite easily.

If your opponent is opening with an expansion of their own or has mined the same amount of gas as you have, then consider cutting the Raven and going into delayed Cloaked Banshee OR Siege Tank production of your own. Whichever you choose is personal preference.

When your second Orbital Command finishes and you are still worried about a 1 base play, consider scanning your opponents main base.  Against 1 base non-Banshee play, starting Siege Tanks and using your Raven for Seeker Missile is an easy way to stay safe. Against 1 base Banshee play, position your Marines and Raven near your production or mineral line as you start a Viking or two for extra defense.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either Marine/Tank/Medivac or Mech play.

When transitioning into Marine/Tank play, against Mech and 3CC builds you can get away with starting your 3rd Command Center right away and following-up with 2 Barracks with Tech labs (to start Stimpack/Combat Shields), 3 Refineries, and 2 Engineering bays.

Against a player opening straight into Bio play, however, it is necessary to start a Tech lab on your initial Barracks as soon as possible for a quicker Stimpack. Then, after taking a 2nd Refinery, you can build a 2nd Barracks onto the naked Reactor and start Siege Tank production to take yourself into the midgame. This is followed up by a 3rd Command Center (between 8:00-8:30), 1 more Barracks, both Refineries at your natural expansion, and 2 Engineering Bays. Not having Stimpack completed in time for the inevitable 10ish minute drop play can be a game changer because with the new Medivacs boosting around your main and natural, it is very easy to get caught out of position and take a lot of damage for free.

Another possible follow-up is going for Mech play. By starting a 3rd Command Center instantly, getting all 4 Refineries, and making 2 more Factories and an Armory, youll instantly be at the midgame infrastructure you need. Be sure to make Vikings for drop defense and start your Siege Tank production instantly so that you have a healthy Siege Tank count to defend any early drops/pressure.

Tips

- Fully read the Scouting section of this build before performing it in a game.  The reactions to scouting information as presented in the Scouting section must be learned before this build is even worth performing in a real game.
- SCV scout with this build at 12 or 13 supply.
- If you are absolutely sure your opponent is not opening with Banshee play, then starting delayed Banshee production of your own instead of the Raven is a great way to get midgame map control and a lot more scouting information.
- Against the first Banshee, you might need to pull all of your Marines to your production or mineral line while you wait for the Raven to pop.  This is completely fine  try to minimize damage by pulling all of your SCVs to one location so that your Raven provides detection over all of your vulnerable spots once it is out.
- Anticipate how many Banshees your opponent is making and either continue to produce Vikings or stop after 1 or 2 for safety.
- Be sure to transition into your midgame infrastructure as soon as you have successfully defended the Banshees.

Pros and Cons

This build defends early pressure quite easily, while getting a quick expansion and going into the midgame. Also, this build is incredibly versatile when it comes to transitions, for opening with a 1/1/1 grants you the freedom to transition into nearly anything.

However, this build requires a lot of scouting in order to be performed effectively.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Bomber Reaper FE to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE, optimized by Startale Bomber, gets out exactly one Reaper for scouting as well and a ridiculously fast Command Center. Then it follows up with a Bio army with just as much strength as a gasless 1rax FE can provide.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they get an expansion (or note if they do not expand by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Also, if you do not know whether your opponent has a Stargate or not, it is a safe plan to build one Missile Turret per mineral line to defend any Oracle shenanigans.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and Medivacs. After this build, get a 3rd Command Center, 3 more Barracks (for a total of 8), and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to head into a strong, late game army.

Note: It is completely viable to replace the 4th and 5th Barracks in this build with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost, most Terrans (including Startale Bomber) have been getting lots of Barracks early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having those extra reinforcements.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important  be sure to mine exactly 100 Gas so that you have enough for the Reaper and Reactor and no more.  Getting your natural Command Center up before the 2nd Supply Depot is a strength of this build.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add a 2nd Bunker at the front, and consider getting a Missile Turret in each mineral line.
- Oracles, even with an expansion, massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you have to instantly get out one Missile Turret per mineral line.
- The gas timings of this build are somewhat more delayed than what you might be used to if you usually play with a gasless 1rax FE.  Therefore, be sure to cut all Marauder production until after your Starport has completed.
- When you move out with your Medivacs, be sure to boost in and out of where your opponent is expecting.  Forcing out the Mothership Cores energy can be the difference between an quick win and a potential loss.

Pros and Cons

This build is good because it gives you the economy and infrastructure on par with a Wings of Liberty style 1rax FE. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Getting such a fast Reactor gives you enough marines to defend early game Stalker + Mothership Core harass.  Finally, this build takes no detours and goes directly into Bio+Medivac play, so your Stim+Medivac aggression happens much sooner than if you go for an early Widow Mine Drop.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes, especially if you lose your Reaper.

Simple, economical, and deceptively dangerous, Bomber takes us back to 2012 with an incredibly early 16 Marine Combat Shield Push that simultaneously takes a 6:00 3rd. An excellent low APM alternative for players who dislike Reapers and Hellions.

Scouting

Because you are not opening Reapers, you are in danger of unexpected Roach or Speedling attacks. And because you are not making Hellions, you will have difficulty confirming the existence of a Zerg third base if Speedlings are on the map, as well as being vulnerable to unscouted Baneling Busts. As such, your only SCV scout is crucial in determining if your Zerg opponent has opened with gas or not.

If your opponent has opened gasless, keep your scouting SCV alive and hidden as long as possible to confirm the existence of a third base by 6:30. If no third is taken by 6:30, it is worth scanning, as many dangerous builds, such as Soulkeys 1-1 Roach Timing, start gasless off of two bases.

If your opponent has opened gas but stopped mining at 100 gas, assume that Speedlings are on the way. As such, depending on how quickly your opponent chose to take his gas, a wall off is necessary before six minutes. It is fine to use your 3rd CC as part of your natural wall off on certain maps, such as Frost, Yeonsu, and Polar Night. However, if your opponent went for much faster Speedlings (Gas -> Pool -> Hatch), then it is advisable to wall off ASAP using Depots and bunkers, and delaying your 3rd CC. Additionally, consider not performing your Marine timing if the speedling count is abnormally high (30 or above).

If your opponent has opened gas but has continued mining past 100, it is necessary to check whether or not Metabolic Boost is researching with your scouting SCV. Beyond that, scan to see what is coming your way and build extra bunkers if necessary. You are specifically looking for a combination of the following: obvious tech cues (baneling nest, roach warren, fast lair), lack of Queens/Creep Spread (if there are only two injecting, then something is wrong), lack of Evolution Chambers, lack of a timely third base, and a flood of overlords.

It is highly reommended you do not perform your timing unless it is obvious your opponent is opening nonthreatening gas tech, such as Overlord Speed or very fast upgrades. And finally, depending on what you scout, if it becomes very obvious that no timing will occur, consider getting Stimpack instead of Combat Shields, as well as producing Marauders from your tech labbed Barracks.

Transitions

Because you have already invested so much infrastructure into Barracks and infantry upgrades, your only transition from this build is a bio based composition. However, because you have invested no money whatsoever into Factory tech, you can transition smoothly into Biomine, Biobat, Biobat with Thors, Marine Tank, or even Pure Bio.

Additionally, the Factory and Engineering Bay ordering is entirely up to the users discretion. If you feel you are in danger of a counter all in, or want faster Medivacs for aggression, then start the Factory first. If you feel that you do not want to fall behind in upgrades, start two Engineering bays first.

Tips

Your first priority with this build is accurately assessing whether or not you can do damage with a timing push.

If you feel you can do damage with the timing, do your best to ensure your opponent has as little idea of it as possible. Have lone marines ready at your base to deny Overlord scouting, and hide the bulk of your marines on the main ramp connecting to the natural base. Keep your Barracks away from the edges of your base; especially the one with a researching Tech Lab. If there is a way to construct a third base that an Overlord can obviously see it (such as by the natural choke at Polar Night, where there is almost always an overlord), then that would be best. Most Zergs upon seeing such an early third will let their guard down and drone heavily.

As youre moving out with the Marine squad at 7:00, have at least two scans saved and do your best to avoid obvious overlord positions, and either clear the towers beforehand (impossible vs Speedlings) or avoid them altogether if possible. The best possible scenario is you catch your opponent completely off guard with no Larva banked in the middle of a huge cycle of drones, with 16 marines at his third base.

Use your banked scans as best you can to clear huge swatches of creep, with priority on active tumors. If you do kill the third, use your discretion to decide whether or not attacking further into the natural (emphasis now on the Evolution Chambers or Nat Hatch) or retreating with your marines is the better choice.

DO NOT REINFORCE THIS PUSH. It relies heavily on the element of surprise. Once Zerg reacts and begins to produce cycles of defending units, your reinforcements (3 marines every 25 seconds) will be easily overwhelmed without force multipliers such as Widow Mines, Medivacs, or Battlecruisers.

During the actual engagements, stutter stepping and positioning are critical. Wedging all your marines into the mineral line of his third and using his hatchery as a choke seems to be the optimal engagement zone. If slow banes are involved, split as best you can without stim or target fire them down.

On the other hand, if you feel you cannot do damage with your timing, theres no problem whatsoever. Stay behind your walloff, make bunkers if necessary, and wait for Factory Tech and Medivacs to perform a standard creep clearing push. You are already ahead with your 6:00 3rd and triple MULE income.

Pros and Cons

This build is one of the most economical builds available while still having a surprising amount of potential to outright win a game. It also deflects non baneling based aggression excellently, such as Roach Ling timings. Additionally, the build has a surprising amount of creep clearing potential, as few Zergs will stand toe to toe with 16 Combat Shield Marines this early in the game; most Zergs will surrender their creep without a fight.

The weaknesses of this build, however, are equally apparent.If scouted, the push has a high chance of outright failing. In addition, because your infrastructure is so limited during and following the attack (3 mostly naked Barracks), you are extremely susceptible to counter all ins and heavy Baneling based counter attacks, especially after you kill their third but lose all 16 marines in the process.

And finally, because you have not opened Reapers or hellions, your information is extremely limited, and confirming the existence of a third base can be very difficult if you lose your scouting SCV too early on.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,OrbitalCommand,Marine,CommandCenter,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,Marine,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,OrbitalCommand,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Marine,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,CombatShield,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,CommandCenter,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Marine,Refinery,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,Marine,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,CallMule,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,EngineeringBay,EngineeringBay,ReactorOnBarracks,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,StimPack,OrbitalCommand,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,InfantryArmorLevel1,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Factory,Refinery,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marauder,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SCV,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Marauder,Armory,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,CallMule,TechLabOnFactory,Factory,SCV,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DrillingClaws,Barracks,Barracks,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,ConcussiveShells,InfantryWeaponsLevel2,InfantryArmorLevel2,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,ReactorOnFactory,CommandCenter,Marauder,DoubleMedivacs', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:27:11 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Dear Phoenix into Colossus', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Forge Fast Expand and then gets several Phoenix for map control and scouting. While you are using the scouting Phoenix, you transition into Colossus play in order to secure your third base and set up a stable midgame OR all-in your opponent with a Stalker/Colossus/Phoenix army.

Scouting

After any early game shenanigans are ruled out, as you have spotted your opponent?s third Hatchery going down, the rest of your scouting will come from your Phoenix.

Use your Phoenix to first pick off every Overlord on the map that is undefended by creep/Queens. Then use them to poke around your opponent?s base ? picking up units not protected by Spore Crawlers/Queens. Be sure to focus on what tech structures you see your opponent making. If you spot a swell of Roaches, stay on 2 bases and consider extra Immortals. If you spot a Hydralisk Den, be sure your Robotics Bay is constantly producing Colossus. If you spot a Spire, instantly get a Twilight Council and go for Blink/+2 Ground Weapons while you resume Phoenix production from your Stargate. You might have to cancel your Colossus production.

Transitions

This build can either all-in off of 2 bases or safely secure a third base to comfortably play a macro game.

If you are choosing to all-in with this build, be sure to go up to 8 Gateways and 3 Colossus with Extended Thermal Lance before moving out. Constantly reinforce with Stalkers as you use your +1/+1, 3-Colossus, 5-Phoenix, 8 Gateway all-in to crush through a Roach/Hydra based army. Watch out for Viper play, though!

If you are choosing to play the macro game, timing your third base is tricky. Dear warps in a lot of Zealots from his 4 Gateways before securing his third if he sees any amount of units on the map with his constant Phoenix scouting. If Dear doesn?t see any Roach/Ling force out on the map (as in game 3 of Dear vs Soulkey), then he will take it even before his first Colossus is started. As you take your third base, set up a Cannon defense surrounded by Pylons/Gateways to help with Zergling runbys as you tech up into the late game. Getting a Twilight Council to continue +2 Ground Weapons and Blink is a solid way to both deal with tech switches and set you up for a 3 base attack. Be sure to spend your excess minerals on proxy Pylons and Zealot runbys to keep your opponent?s base count in check.

Tips

- Spend all of your early game chronoboost on your two Nexus to maximize Probe production.
- The exact FFE build order you use is up to your personal preference. Dear has performed this build after a Forge First FFE, Nexus First FFE, and a failed attempted Cannon Rush.
- If possible, hide the Stargate somewhere in your base that is less likely to be scouted by an Overlord.
- Chronoboost your Stargate to get out those Phoenix as quickly as possible to deny any Overlord scouting of your follow-up Robotics transition.
A main strength of this build is its versatility, but you can only be versatile if you have the necessary scouting information. Scouting your opponent?s tech path and army production with your Phoenix is crucial.
- If you spot your opponent playing very greedy, you can choose to warp-in all of your Zealots from your 4 Gateways aggressively and hit a +1 Zealot/Phoenix timing while continuing the build at home.
- Chronoboost your Robotics Facility to get out your Colossus as quickly as possible and set up a solid midgame army.

Pros and Cons

This build is an incredibly versatile build that can be used as a macro opener or a 2 base all-in. It gets out early Phoenix for scouting and map control while transitioning into a solid ground based Colossus midgame.

However, this build requires a lot of APM and focus in order to execute.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Dear 3gate Blink', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a 3 Gateways and Blink, using a Hallucinated Phoenix to scout for potential Dark Shrine or Stargate shenanigans. It produces a healthy Stalker count to apply pressure to your opponent or safely secure your expansion against any all-in.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker(s) back to the protection of your Sentry quickly if you have to defend an early attack.
The majority of your scouting comes from your Hallucinated Phoenix. Your phoenix should be able to get into your opponent?s main base and determine what tech route you see your opponent going.
- If your opponent is expanding quickly, then consider warping in Stalkers non-stop from a proxy Pylon as you all-in your opponent with a Blink all-in. Should you choose to expand instead, you will be slightly behind economically ? but with Blink.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then be sure that you do NOT over produce Stalkers.  Instead, expand and fall back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.
- If your opponent has a Stargate, then be sure to not take damage against early Phoenix or Oracles by initially positioning your Stalkers defensively. You can expand quite easily behind your Blink play and go into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame or all-in your opponent if you spot them taking a fast expansion behind the Stargate.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then consider getting a Robotics Facility instantly in order to make one Observer for detection against DTs. If you are sure your opponent is also opening with Blink, then constantly produce Immortals and defend a natural expansion OR skip the Robotics Facility entirely and try to win the Blink Stalker vs Blink Stalker micro war.

Transitions

This build is a very safe opener that allows you either to all-in your opponent with Blink Stalkers or transitions into a macro game quite easily. However, the actual steps you take to transition into it often depend completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with. This is why scouting with the Hallucinated Phoenix and generally being active on the map with your Blink Stalkers is crucial.
If you choose to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly produce Stalkers 3 at a time from your proxy Pylons and attack as soon as Blink Research is finished (@7:40ish). Bait out a Planetary Nexus and/or kill the Mothership Core and as many Sentries as possible before fully committing to an attack. If your opponent is on one base, you can still expand at home ? using your Sentry to force field the ramp to stop his army from coming down and engaging you with his entire army.
In Twilight vs Stargate macro games, abuse your mobility to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you have a strong midgame Chargelot/Immortal/Archon army ready. In Twilight vs Robotics macro games, again abuse your mobility to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you get a healthy Chargelot/Archon count up.  Keep tabs on your opponent?s tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Twilight vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponent?s potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by getting a Robotics Facility and producing Observers/Immortals or by winning the Blink Stalker vs Blink Stalker position battles in the open field.
The most common way to start the transition into Chargelot/Immortal/Archon is by starting a 2nd Nexus, a Robotics Facility and 2 more Assimilators, a Forge for +1 Ground Weapons, and Zealot Charge research in that order. Add on the Templar Archives and Archons when you can afford it.

Tips

- Once you start your Mothership Core, save your chronoboost so that you can dump it all into Blink Research. Only 1 or 2 chronoboosts should be spent on Warpgate (unless you spot your opponent going for very early aggression).
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial Stalkers to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap?s 3gate All-in).
- Against Stargate play, be sure to position your units to defend your mineral line from potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- If you choose to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly chronoboost Blink and then later your Gateways to get the maximal amount of units out with Blink as soon as possible. Bait out a Planetary Nexus and/or kill the Mothership Core and as many Sentries as possible before fully committing to an attack. If your opponent is on one base, you can still expand at home ? using your Sentry to force field the ramp to stop his army from coming down and engaging you with his entire army.
- If you choose to expand behind this build, do not produce more than 8 Stalkers which you should use to take map control and poke your opponent?s front. Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases. Transitioning into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon unit composition is very strong.

Pros and Cons

This build is a versatile, aggressive build that can pressure your opponent or defend basically any all-in with Blink Stalkers. It gets a fast Hallucinated Phoenix scout your opponent?s main base and let you know if you need detection, should reposition your army, or all-in your opponent.
However, this build requires a lot of scouting information to be executed effectively, so getting a Hallucination into your opponent?s base is crucial.

This build opens with a Stargate for Phoenix and some early ground units to provide the infrastructure necessary to react to every build an opposing Protoss might throw at you.

Benchmark: When your Nexus finishes (@6:45ish), you should have 3 Phoenix, 1 Sentry, 1 Stalker, a Mothership Core, and around 23 Probes.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker back to the protection of your Sentry quickly if you have to defend an early attack.

The majority of your scouting comes from your Phoenix. Your Phoenix should be able to get into your opponents main base and determine what tech route you see your opponent going.

- If your opponent is expanding quickly, then feel safe while applying some light harass with your Phoenix. You can dictate the pace of the game by committing to a lot of Phoenix or starting a Twilight Council or Robotics Facility and defaulting back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then be sure that deal some economic damage with your initial Phoenix. Either commit to Phoenix and Void Rays or default back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.
- If your opponent has a Stargate, then be sure to not take damage against early Phoenix or Oracles by initially positioning your units defensively.  Getting a healthy Phoenix lead against your opponent will most likely be enough for you to end the game.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then consider getting a Robotics Facility instantly in order to make one Observer for detection against DTs.  Alternatively, you can position your units with an Oracle at your main ramp and defend for a while. Regardless, do not make more Phoenix and instead transition into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame with your economic advantage.

Transitions

This build is a very safe opener that gives you the scouting capabilities and infrastructure to react to any build your opponent can perform. However, the actual steps you take to transition into a stable midgame often depend completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with. This is why scouting with your Phoenix and generally being active on the map (perhaps with a delayed scouting Probe) is crucial.

In Stargate vs Twilight macro games, harass your opponent with your Phoenix, but transition out of Stargate units into an economic Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame as soon as possible. In Stargate vs Robotics macro games, again harass your opponent to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you get a healthy Chargelot/Archon count up. Keep tabs on your opponents tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Stargate vs Stargate macro games, position your Phoenix more defensively while you chronoboost your Phoenix non-stop.

The most common way to start the transition into Chargelot/Immortal/Archon is by starting a Robotics Facility and 2 more Assimilators, followed by a Twilight Council and Forge for +1 Ground Weapons and Zealot Charge. Add on the Templar Archives and Archons when you can afford it.

Tips

- Once you start your Mothership Core, save your chronoboost so that you can dump it all into Phoenix. There is no need to chronoboost Warpgate (unless you spot your opponent going for very early aggression).
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial few Gateway units to stop a Probe from setting up a proxy Pylon and allowing for a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Traps 3gate All-in).
- Against Stargate play, position your Stargate units defensively around your mineral lines to defend potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- Otherwise, always be active with your Phoenixes. The main priority for the Phoenix is to get scouting information, for only when you have a full read on your opponents build can you can start chronoboosting probes and enter the midgame.
- Even though you open with a Stargate, transitioning into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon unit composition in the midgame can be very strong.
- When entering the late game, however, be sure to produce Tempest from your inactive Stargateespecially against a Colossus-based opponent.

Pros and Cons

This build is a versatile, economic build that can harass your opponent and provide the scouting information necessary to defend a fast expansion.  Also, your Phoenix can do terrible, terrible damage to Robo-based build such as duckdeoks 3Gate Robo, and even perform well in a macro game against greedy builds such as NaNiwas Safe Expand.

However, this build requires a lot of scouting information to be executed effectively. It also is quite difficult to defend early attacks if you do not kill your opponents proxy Pylon.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'DeMusliM Reaper FE', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This HotS Reaper FE, optimized by Flash and DeMusliM, gets out exactly one Reaper for scouting and a ridiculously fast Engineering Bay for an early +1 Infantry Attack in order to hit a 10 minute timing with +1/+1, Stimpack, and Medivacs.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (opening with a Reaper FE means that you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they expand (or note if they do not get a fast expansion by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Also, if you do not know whether or not your opponent has built a Stargate, taking advantage of your ridiculously fast Engineering Bay to build a Missile Turret is not a bad idea too.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and Medivacs.  After this build, secure your 3rd Command Center, continue your upgrades with +2 Infantry Attack, build 6 more Barracks (for a total of 8), and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to go into a strong, late game army. Your fast third Command Center and early upgrades means that your late game army will be much stronger than your opponents assuming that you are able to deny their third base with your initial Medivac poke.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important  be sure to mine exactly 100 Gas so that you have enough for the Reaper and Reactor and no more.  Getting your natural Command Center up before the 2nd Supply Depot is a major strength of this build.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add a 2nd Bunker at the front, and consider getting a Missile Turret in each mineral line. 
- Oracles, even with an expansion, massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you have to instantly get out one Missile Turret per mineral line.
- The gas timings of this build are somewhat more delayed than what you might be used to if you usually play with a gasless 1rax FE.  Therefore, be sure to cut all Marauder production until after your Starport has completed.
- Try not to take any huge engages against your Protoss opponent with your initial Medivacs unless you are sure you can do damage.  With only 2 Barracks producing units, and such a fast 3rd Command Center, your army is not designed to outright win the game  rather to further your economic and upgrade advantage in order to win the game at a later point.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because it gives you the economy and infrastructure on par with a Wings of Liberty style 1rax FE. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Not to mention the fact that you also get a ridiculously early Engineering Bay in order to kick start your Bio upgrades very early. This build also takes no detours and goes directly into Bio+Medivac play, so your Stim+Medivac aggression happens much sooner than if you go for early Widow Mines.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes, especially if you lose your Reaper.

This 12 Roach Rush is a timing attack designed to cripple a Terran economy, transitioning into a further all-in or macro play as needed.

Scouting

There is only minor scouting necessary with this build before you hit your opponent with your 12 Roaches. Simply ensure that your opponent is not cheesing you with an 8-8-8 opener or proxy 11/11 Rax.
Once you are committed in the attack, be on the look-out for signs that your opponent is going for a full-on macro play (3 Command Centers), some sort of Hellbat aggression (Armory), some sort of Banshee play (Techlabbed Starport), or normal Bio play (multiple Barracks). Your upcoming transition requires you to both do some damage and later handle any counter attack potential from your opponent without losing much yourself.

Transitions

Depending on what you are most comfortable with and what you scout your opponent doing, you can transition into a later all-in or macro play yourself. Note that regardless of whichever path you follow, you will have to do some amount of damage with your attack or you will be behind both in terms of economy and tech.
If you are transitioning into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk play, stop all Roach production, and get a Lair, Metabolic Boost, and 2 Evolution Chambers as soon as possible. Getting Mutalisks out to defend 3 bases from drops as you tech towards +2/+2 Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk with all the necessary upgrades is how you?ll get ahead in the midgame.
If you are transitioning into a Roach based midgame, try to avoid making many more Roaches after your initial 12 roach opener. Instead, focus on securing 3 Hatcheries, 2 Evolution Chambers, and teching for a Speed Roach/Speed Hydra midgame (with potentially Swarm Host/Viper lategame).
If you are transitioning into another all-in, your best best is some sort of Roach based army with splash damage (such as a Roach/Bane all-in). Do note that any follow-up all-in will be particularly weak against Banshee or Widow Mine defenses.

Tips

- As you get to your first 100 Gas, if there is still a scout in your main base, consider fake researching Metabolic Boost. Be sure to cancel if before you get to 28 supply and need to start your Roach Warren.
- Don?t over-commit to making Roaches. Only make 12 and then be sure you are getting the necessary 2 base economy, Overlord count, and creep spread back at home while your attack is commencing.
- The point of the attack is to cripple your opponent, but if the attack does not go too well, there is no retreat; your follow-up depends largely on your ability to scout what your opponent has opened with and react/defend accordingly.

Pros and Cons

This aggressive build can outright defeat opponents that are macroing too hard or do not scout and react adequately. Opening with 12 Roaches gives your early game a muscle that not many other ZvT builds give you, giving you great denial of any Reaper/Hellion openers as well.
However, this build does put you behind both in terms of economy and tech if your attack does not do damage. In order to equalize the game, you must do some sort of damage as well as drone up back at home to crush your opponent later in the game.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,RoachWarren,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:27:11 PM;

This macro build order opens with a quick 3 Hatchery opening to get a strong economy and then transitions into a Tech-heavy army in order to stay safe against early attacks and lay on the aggression to Protoss before the late game starts. This build maxes out on Roach/Hydra/Viper in order to crush your opponent?s army or deny their 3rd/4th base.

Scouting

Scout with either Overlords, Zerglings, Overseer, or Changelings when your Hydralisk Den goes down. Send them into either the main base or the 3rd base in order to see if Protoss is going for a tech-heavy composition (Colossus/Void Ray/etc) or a Chargelot-heavy composition. If they are going for a Chargelot heavy composition, instantly throw down a Banelings Nest, start Baneling Speed, and max out with around 16 Banelings in your unit composition.
Besides this, all mid and late game scouting comes from the Roach/Hydra/Viper pokes or attacks that you will perform. React appropriately by either re-maxing with Ultras or Swarm Hosts. You will need a 5th base to fully support any Hive-tech re-maxes.

Transitions

There is no ?transition? per se. If you can win the game with this push, then be sure to attack in an open position, use Blinding Cloud or Abduct appropriately, and take the game quickly. If you cannot win the game outright, then fall back on your 4/5 base economy and tech switch to whatever best counters your opponent?s army. Note that you should get a lot of static defense in order to stay safe during your super late game tech switches between Mutalisks, Swarm Hosts, and Ultralisks.

Tips

- If your first Overlord scouts your opponent going for a Gateway expand, then you should abandon getting the third base, instead getting an Extractor and starting Metabolic Boost before taking your 3rd.
- If your natural gets Pylon blocked, then you can make an early Overlord at 15 supply instead of the Hatchery in order to buy some time against it. If your opponent lets the Pylon finish, then simply making 4-6 Zerglings to take the Pylon down should be enough of a commitment before returning back to the build.
- Being thorough about checking for early proxy Pylons across the map with your early game Zerglings is crucial against early Protoss timings. Being able to spot aggression and stop it before it can even begin is the easiest way to avoid quick losses.
- Be sure you send in an Overlord scout at 7:00. Spotting your opponent?s midgame tech informs your next step with this build(whether it be more Drones, a Hydralisk Den, or Spore Crawlers).
- Vipers will be usable (Consume finishes) 3:30 after your Infestation Pit starts.
- Scouting for a heavy Chargelot composition before you max can be quite important. Throwing down a Banelings Nest and maxing with several Banelings can be the difference between a quick loss and a sure win.
- Once you have re-maxed on Ultras, starting a Spire and tech-switching between Mutalisks and Swarm Hosts/Ultras is a strong way to win in the very late game. Also note that you should get a lot of static defense when performing these late game tech switches.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a hugely economic opening while still being safe. It then transitions into a Viper-based defense in order to secure your 4th base and quickly max out on Roach/Hydra/Viper.
This build however requires constant scouting in order to be safe.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Hwangsin Stargate Expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with 5 Stalkers to apply pressure to your opponent and scout for what theyre opening.  It then follows up with a Stargate Expand, allowing you to reactively counter your opponents opening tech.

Benchmark: When you Stargate finishes (@6:30ish), you should have 24 Probes, 5 Stalkers, and a Mothership Core.

Scouting

Because of how low on minerals you are, you cannot afford to Probe scout.Thus, all of your scouting comes from your Stalkers.

Being active with your initial 3 Stalkers around your natural, third, and watchtower will prevent your opponent from sneaking proxy Pylons past you and hitting you with a very fast Gateway unit attack. Also, with your mobile army, you can head directly at your opponent in order to scout what units they have made and even attack them if they are attempting to expand quickly.  Your 5 Stalkers (with high ground vision from your Mothership Core) must scout what your opponent is doing, so that you can react accordingly with your Stargate in the midgame.

- If your opponent is fast expanding, then produce an Oracle from your Stargate and attempt to pressure the front with your Stalkers as your Oracle does damage in the main.
- If your opponent has multiple Sentries out, then attempt to bust up the ramp with your Stalkers to force him to use Force Fields to defend his ramp. The most likely scenario is that your opponent is making a Robotics Facility behind their Sentry count. However, it is also possible that your opponent is making a Stargate instead.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then make an Oracle or two and keep them in their base by threatening to kill multiple workers if they leave.
- If your opponent has a Stargate of their own, make constant Phoenix and position your units very defensively to deal with early Oracles.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then make one Oracle to stay defensive with in case of DTs. Afterwards, you can make up to 3-4 Phoenix for map control and harass potential, but quickly transition into Void Ray/Immortal to stay safe against Blink play.

Transitions

This build transitions into a macro game very easily. However, the actual unit composition of that macro game very often depends completely on what build your opponent has chosen to open with. If your opponent stays on one base for too long, then throw down more Gateways, constantly make units, and prepare to defend your natural with Void Rays, Stalkers, (possibly Immortals), and your Planetary Nexus. In Stargate vs Stargate macro games, quickly go up to 2 Stargates constantly making Phoenix and get a Fleet Beacon for the Phoenix Range upgrade. In Stargate vs Robotics macro games, use your Phoenix or Oracles to get an economic advantage, while transitioning into Sky-toss or a Phoenix/Blink all-in. In Stargate vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponents potential Blink or Dark Templar harass, as you transition to Void Ray/Immortal for defense or pure Sky-toss.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very safe build that gets quick map control with 5 Stalkers early on for safety, aggression, and scouting. With accurate scouting information, it then transitions into Stargate play and expands so that you can play a reactive macro game with a strong economy.

When you are out on the map with your first Stalkers, however, your opponent might sneak an Oracle into your main base. Be careful that you are only aggressive when you can be aggressive and only use your Stalkers for scouting when you cannot be aggressive.

This aggressive build hits your opponent with relentless harassment, either outright winning the game or giving you a considerable economic advantage before even entering the midgame. Also, with Widow Mine and Banshee play, this build force a lot of scans  giving you another sort of economic advantage going into the midgame.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your 1st Refinery so as to check whether your opponent is opening Reapers or not. Against a Reaper player, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe and try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or an expansion at your natural with your first Marines.

Your next scout will come with your Widow Mine Drop. With this drop you can check what your opponents opener is. Against a Banshee player, you can following through with the build and trying to out-micro him in Banshee vs Banshee harass, or you can cancel your banshee and start a Viking and Engineering Bay for a Turret to play safe. Against a Hellbat Dropping player, make a few more Widow Mines to position them defensively against any incoming drop as you use your Widow Mine Drop and incoming Banshee to out-harass him. Against a player going for a similar Widow Mine Drop, you can either pull back and try to defend or attempt to do more SCV damage with your drop than he does with his.

Finally, when your first Banshee starts its harass, you will get a good look at everything else your opponent is doing when trying to transition into the midgame. Keep an eye out for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either Marine/Tank or Mech play quite easily.

When transitioning into Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production early in order to have a safe defense and later strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use.
- Keep your eyes peeled for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop a drop or Banshee. Do NOT drop on top of an active Widow Mine.
- With your initial Widow Mine drop, avoid Turrets at all costs. The main purpose of the drop is to force multiple scans, with a side goal of dealing crippling economic damage.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that were already weakened by the initial drop before attacking any of the full health SCVs.
- If your opponent has a Missile Turret already set up in his mineral line, then do not worry. Instead, camping a Terrans production with a Widow Mine and several Marines can be just as effectiveespecially with the Banshee follow-up that hits soon after.
- Always favor keeping your Medivac and Banshee alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural. You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very strong, aggressive play style that opens up with unrelenting harassment before even entering the midgame. With a Widow Mine drop and Banshee follow-up, you can kill many SCVs and also force your opponent to scan often  giving you another type of economic advantage. Finally, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for opening with a 1/1/1 grants you the freedom to go into nearly anything.

However, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades. Also, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,Factory,Refinery,CallMule,SCV,Marine,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,Starport,WidowMine,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,WidowMine,Medivac,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnStarport,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,Banshee,CloakingField,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,Banshee,TechLabOnFactory,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:27:11 PM;

This build opens with 2 Stalkers and a Mothership Core to take map control, and then follows up with a Warp Prism and 5 Gateways to drop the main of your opponent and force field him out of his own base.

Benchmark: When your Warp Prism finishes (@7:05ish), you should have around 32 Probes, 2 Stalkers, 4 Sentries, 1 Warp Prism, and a Mothership Core.

Scouting

This build is most effective against gasless openers from Terran, and quite ineffective against 1 base plays. Thus, be sure that you confirm your opponent doing a Reaper FE, CC First, or 1rax FE build with either your Probe scout at 13 supply or with your initial Stalker poke. If your opponent has not opened with an expansion, then abandon the Warp Prism and go instead for 2 more Assimilators, a Robotics Bay, double Forge, and standard macro PvT play. If your opponent has opened with an expansion, then proceed with this build and be sure to force field your opponent out of his main base.

Transitions

This build is a strong, 5 gate attack off of 2 bases with only 2 Assimilators.  Thus, you have to damage with this attack if you want to go into the midgame with an advantage. Assuming you do no damage and you lose the Warp Prism, you will have a very hard time coming back in the game, and should play stupidly greedy if you want a chance to come back. If you do some damage with this build but eventually lose everything, then you might still be in the game; transition by getting both Assimilators at your natural and go into a standard Colossi/Forge midgame. If you do a lot of damage and save some of your army with the Warp Prism, then you can feel free to take a greedy third base instantly while transitioning directly into Colossi+upgrades off of double Forge.

Tips

- Use your initial Stalkers and Mothership Core for map control and early game scouting. Only build the Warp Prism if you are playing against an expanding Terran. Get your naturals Assimilators and go into Colossi if you see your opponent staying on one base.
- Against Reaper play, keep at least one Stalker at home in order to defend your Probes and/or stop him from seeing your Warp Prism.
- When you finish your Warp Prism, load up your 4 Sentries instantly and head directly for your opponents main base.
- Poke your opponents front with your Stalkers before you go into the main with your Warp Prism to make sure that your opponent has all his units at his natural.
- Drop your Sentries on the high ground near your opponents ramp to instantly force field him out.
- Transform your Warp Prism into Phasing Mode and constantly warp-in 5 units at a time, favoring Zealots and Sentries.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with your Stalkers/Mothership Core to easily defend Reapers as well as take map control. Then, with the scouting intel that your Probe and Stalker poke give you, you follow up with a very early Warp Prism and 5 gate attack in order to drop in your opponents main while you force field him out. Against a non-expand build, you have the Robotics Facility and can get Observers or Immortals to play safe.

However, opening with this build delays your midgame tech by a lot. By only staying on 2 Assimilators, you do not have the gas income to go into Colossi instantly, and thus have to rely on your Warp Prism doing damage to get a leg up on your opponent. Also, this build relies a lot on early game scouting in order to ensure that your opponent is going for a standard expansion into Bio play.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,MothershipCore,Stalker,Chronoboost,Probe,Nexus,Probe,RoboticsFacility,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Chronoboost,WarpPrism,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpInSentry,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInSentry,WarpInSentry,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:27:12 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Goswer 2 Base Roach-Ling All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This 2 base, Hatchery-tech Roach-Speedling all-in crushes through Void Ray-less Stargate or heavy Gateway Protoss openers, both out of a Gateway Expand or Forge Fast Expand.

Scouting

Send your first Overlord to scout your opponent?s natural wall to spot for a Forge Fast Expand or Gateway Expand, and then send it to a safe area for a later 7:00 scout.  Consider using your 2nd Overlord to guard your natural expansion against Cannon Rushes. Your next Overlords can be placed around your opponent?s main or natural base as backup scouts or for vision of their 3rd base.
Use your initial Zerglings to scout around the map for Probes and proxy Pylons. Keep a Zergling outside his front to scout for any early pokes, and avoid any Stalkers or the Mothership Core whenever possible.
The majority of your scouting will come from the Roach/Ling all-in. Note whether or not your opponent has opened with a Stargate, Robotics Facility, or Gateway-heavy army, and react accordingly.

Transitions

This build is a 2 base Roach/Ling all-in off of only 27 Drones, so there is no well defined transition. That being said, if the attack is not going well, be sure to pull back and keep your units alive, instantly resume Droning, and attempt to secure a third base and 3rd Queen.  Going for Lair and Roach Speed or Hydralisks is probably your best way to defend the inevitable counter-attack, but you might be too far behind (based entirely on how much damage your all-in did) for it to be enough.

Tips

- Be active on the map with your initial few Zerglings in order to deny vision of the fact that you do not have a 3rd Hatchery (and especially that you have mined more than 100 gas just for Metabolic Boost).
- Roaches take up a lot of supply, so be sure to start several Overlords BEFORE you need to make the 8 Roaches.
- During the all-in, keeping up on your injects so that you have enough Speedling reinforcements could be the difference between a close game and an easy slaughter.

Pros and Cons

This is a very strong 2 base all-in that uses Roach/Ling to crush your opponent before the midgame has even started. It also requires little scouting and little APM to perform well, so it is a great build for newer players to perform as well.
However, if your opponent spots your lack of third base early on, they should have enough time to wall off their natural with Photon Cannons if they opened with a FFE or get out enough Sentries if they opened with a Gateway Expand. So for this all-in to be effective, you have to deny your opponent?s vision of it.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Extractor,Overlord,Queen,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Zergling,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Queen,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,RoachWarren,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:27:11 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Duckdeok 2 Base Blink Push', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This 1gate FE follows up with a 6gate, 2 base Blink Stalker attack, using the Mothership Core for high ground vision and Time Warp.

Benchmark: When Blink finishes (@7:40ish), you should have with 6 Stalkers and 36 Probes at home.

Attack your opponents natural/main with your first full warp-in from all 6 Gateways (@8:30ish) with 12 Blink Stalkers and constant Stalker reinforcements.

Scouting

This build is an aggressive opener that makes a lot of units, so you will not have to worry about Probe scouting. Against Reaper play, keep your first Stalker on a common hop-up ledge in order to deny your opponent scouting the Twilight Council. Against other defensive play, poke out to your opponents front with your first Stalker and check to see whether your opponent is going for Widow Mines or a quick CC into Bio so you know how to micro when you Blink into his main base with all of your units.

Transitions

This build is a strong 2 base Blink Timing that commits a lots of resources to Stalkers and no resources to upgrades or tech, so your follow-up will be quite slow. If your attack does damage and you keep most of your units alive, then you can start 2 more Assimilators, 2 Forges, and a Templar Archives, in order to transition into a Chargelot/Storm unit composition with Blink Stalkers to help deal with drops. However, if you do not deal some damage with your initial Stalkers, then you will be behind both economically and in tech against an opponent who will have Stimpack and Medivacs soon to follow.

Tips

- Do not bother Probe scouting early on because you can do this build against nearly everything your opponent chooses to open with.
- With your initial Stalkers, either protect your main base from a Reaper scouting your Twilight Council or move out and poke up at your opponents base for some early scouting intel.
- The limiting factor with this build is Blink Researchs build time and finishing your 6 Gateways, so be sure to Chronoboost Blink Research constantly in order to attack as soon as possible.
- Keep your Mothership Core out of harms way.  Use its 14 sight range for high ground vision, but do not commit the Mothership Core in the attack because without high ground vision, your attack will most likely fail.
- Do not forget to use your Mothership Cores Time Warp ability to help pick off SCVs or Bio units that are out of position.
- Do NOT over-commit your Stalkers in a risky blink. Only aggressively blink to get up to a high ground or to pick off a Siege Tank/Widow Mine before it activates.
- Constantly warping-in more Stalkers to reinforce your army and add strength to the attack is key to crushing through your opponents defenses.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong build because of how quickly you get both high ground vision with your Mothership Core and enough Blink Stalkers to do real damage  after opening with a 1gate FE. While your opponent might have Stimpack done in time for the attack, you can still beat your opponent in the open field if you use Time Warp and Blink appropriately.

However, this build commits a lot of resources to the attack, so transitioning into standard play will be much further behind if you had just rushed for High Templars and upgrades. Also, if your Stalker positioning is sub-optimal, a Reaper may scout your Twilight Council and reveal the build before you have even moved out to attack.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Nexus,MothershipCore,WarpgateUpgrade,Pylon,Stalker,GasProbe,GasProbe,TwilightCouncil,Probe,Probe,Stalker,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Blink,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,WarpInStalker,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,Probe,Probe,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:27:11 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'INnoVation 2 Base SCV Pull', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

Designed specifically to kill most Protoss players during the mid game Templar transition, INnoVations SCV pull hits at around 14 minutes with MMM, Vikings, SCVs, and 2/1 upgrades.

Scouting

The first ten minutes of the game is a standard TvP Reaper FE, so scouting and reactions proceed as normal.

First, SCV scout, 15 supply at the latest, to see if you are being 10 gate Zealot rushed. Then follow up with your Reaper scout, checking pylon count, assimilator count, gas mined, and MSC/Stalker/Nexus timing.

Your early Engineering Bay allows for equally early Missile Turrets, so you should be able to build a turret in your main base and position marines in your natural mineral line in the event of an Oracle attack.

Against a delayed Protoss expansion (4:10+, no Nexus), always build a bunker.

Against a fast expanding Protoss, poke with your first Marauder and 8-10 Marines to force overcharge and to gauge his army size.

This initial poke will reveal the following possibilities:

- Little to no Gateway units: Possible double forge (proceed as normal) or Dark Templars (build turrets and bank one scan minimum).
- No obvious Observers: Confirm Twilight tech. If your opponent is going for Templar instead of Colossus, immediately abandon the build and do a biomine parade style using a reactored Factory and five barracks before your third Command Center. SCV pulls are a poor choice against Pisonic Storm.
- More Stalkers then usual: Possible Blink Stalker aggression. React accordingly with bunkers and mines. Consider hiding your small poke squad at his third or fourth, and counter attacking when he moves all his stalkers and his MSC to your side of the map.
- Phoenixes: Phoenix Colossus is by far the most likely choice, but constantly scout to see if the Colossus count is rising. If it remains at one or two for very long, be cognizant of the possibility of a feint into Templars.
- Healthy Gateway unit count: Proceed as normal.

These above are only a few examples, but the most common. Against most styles that involve Colossus (single forge, double forge, blink colossus, phoenix colossus, etc) you will be able to simply play as normal and execute the all in without any problems.

For lower level players, please be advised all scouting reactions as written above are general assumptions made against players attempting optimal strategies. You will be blindsided by sub optimal and often illogical strategies quite often, but you should be able to compensate with superior macro and mechanics.

Transitions

As with any all-in, there is no transition unless you have done a significant amount of damage.

If your attack fails, there is no transition; you will die almost immediately to any counter attack, or you will be contained to two bases and slowly starve to death.

If your attack succeeds in mostly destroying Protosss army, but you cannot finish off your opponent, retreat and rally defensively. Continue your upgrades, maintain consistent worker production, and add a third command center and a Ghost Academy, if necessary.

Tips

The main objective of this push is to successfully engage and destroy his army decisively. Your SCVS are there to absorb just enough Colossus volleys to allow your Vikings to destroy all the AOE and your MMM to shoot through the Gateway buffer.

Again, to emphasize, your objective is to destroy his army decisively, not to destroy his third, or his natural, or snipe any tech. You are to take one crushing victory with your army before beginning to do any eco or tech damage.

During the actual engagement, be sure to have your SCVs in front of your main army. Attack in as wide of a concave as you can form, and make sure that your Vikings are shift A-clicked across his Colossus.

Do not attempt any drops or secondary attacks. Your attack needs to be as strong as possible along a single front for the highest chance of success.

Pros and Cons

The first ten minutes of this build, as mentioned above, are identical to a standard Reaper FE, making this a particularly tricky all in to scout. Additionally, this build has the benefit of blind countering some two base Colossus all-ins because it gets Vikings so quickly, and in such high numbers.

That being said, just as with any all-in, if scouted and identified, this build loses a lot of its potency. A faster than normal Templar transition and increased Sentries for force fields are both popular and effective responses against scouted SCV pulls.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,EngineeringBay,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,SCV,Barracks,SCV,DoubleMarines,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SCV,CallMule,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,TechLabOnBarracks,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,StimPack,Marauder,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,Factory,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marauder,CallMule,SCV,SCV,InfantryArmorLevel1,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Starport,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnFactory,DoubleMarines,Marauder,SCV,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SupplyDepot,Refinery,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,CombatShield,SupplyDepot,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMarines,CallMule,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,Armory,CallMule,Barracks,Barracks,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,ConcussiveShells,SCV,SCV,CallMule,TechLabOnBarracks,ReactorOnBarracks,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,InfantryWeaponsLevel2,SupplyDepot,CallMule,Marauder,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleVikings,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,Marauder,Starport,CallMule,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleVikings,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,CallMule,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Viking,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleVikings,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,CallMule,Marauder,Marauder,Viking,DoubleVikings', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:27:12 PM;

This build opens with a 1gate FE, and transitions directly into both Blink and Colossi. With these two tools you can safely secure your main and natural from both frontal pushes and backdoor drops.

Benchmark: When your first Colossus finishes (@9:00ish), you should have 1 Colossus, 3 Stalkers, a Sentry, a Mothership Core, 2 Observers, and around 50 Probes.

Scouting

This build is a safe build that gets detection and a lot of early game Stalkers, so Probe scouting is unnecessary. Use your initial Stalkers to ward off any of your opponents Reaper(s) or scout the front of your opponents base if they are opening with a Command Center First.

Most of your scouting will come from your 2 Observers. Send the first directly to your opponents main in order to spot what infrastructure is being built. Send the second to a common attack or drop path so that you have vision of when your opponent is moving out.

Against early Widow Mine drops, position your units defensively and consider delaying Colossus production in favor of more Observers.

Transitions

With Blink, Colossus, and Observers, you should be able to safely secure your main and natural expansions. Against bio play, consider getting 4 or 5 more Gateways while continuing your upgrades and taking your 3rd base as soon as you are safe to.

Alternatively, you are also able to go for a 2 Base, +2 Blink Stalker/Colossus all-in with this build.  Simply get your Ground Weapons upgrades instead of Ground Armor, and throw down 7 more Gateways after you start your Colossus production in order to break your opponent with simply Stalkers and Colossi.

Tips

- Chronoboost your Nexii constantly in order to get an economic advantage.
- Use your initial Stalker(s) to ward off any opposing Reapers and/or take a XelNaga Watchtower to see a push coming.
- Position your Robotics Facility, Forge, and Twilight Council in a central location to prevent them from being killed during a drop.
- Your Observers are the main way you can position your army to adequately defend multi-pronged aggression  replace them if they are scanned and lost.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with both Blink Stalkers and Colossi, rushing for all the tools you need to defend Terran aggression.  With strong upgrades and a mobile unit composition, this build allows you to enter the midgame ridiculously quickly.

This build opens with a 3 Stalker Rush to take map control, and follows up with a 1base 3gate Robo in order to pressure you opponent, get detection, and play safe against Blink/Stargate builds. This pressure build produces somewhat stable macro games if you react appropriately to your scouting information.

Scouting

For all early game scouting, please refer to the Scouting section of the 3 Stalker Rush build.

After your initial units have scouted around your side of the map, the majority of your scouting will come from your 3gate pressure at your opponents base.

- If your opponent is fast expanding, then attempt to cancel the Nexus before it finishes. Warp in more units at your proxy Pylon for extra pressure.
- If your opponent has just as many (or almost as many) Gateway units as you, immediately fall back and begin Immortal production. Against either Gateway attacks or Blink All-ins, you need a high Immortal count in order to defend.
- If your opponent does not have as many Gateway units as you, then push up the ramp and attempt to kill his army. Do NOT over-commit once your opponent has activated Photon Overcharge. If you cannot push up his ramp, then warp-in a Sentry or two at his natural and set up a contain while you expand back at home. If during the contain a Stargate unit flies into your base, be sure to activate your Photon Overcharge in order to keep your Probes alive.

Transitions

Once you have set up or a contain or you are forced to retreat back home, be sure to setup your natural expansion. Going into the macro game, however, the actual unit composition of your army very often depends completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with.  If your opponent stays on one base for too long, then throw down more Gateways, constantly make units, and prepare to defend your natural with Stalkers, Immortals, and your Planetary Nexus. In Robotics vs Stargate macro games, quickly switch into Blink or double Stargate play of your own so as to not lose against any Void Ray based armies. In Robotics vs Robotics macro games, Immortal count and/or Colossus count are the most important things. Keep tabs on your opponents tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Robotics vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponents potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by producing Immortals+Gateway units or Colossus for defense.

Tips

- Split your initial chronoboost on Probes and Warpgate Research in the early game so that you are not economically behind but still have a quick Warpgate attack.
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial 3 Stalkers to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Traps 3gate All-in).
- Against fast tech plays, your initial 3gate pressure should give you information on both the type and timing of your opponents attack. Be sure not to over-commit your Stalkers here, however, for Blink or Immortal all-ins will be able to hold your attack and counter-attack with a lot of force if you are careless with your initial units.
- Against Blink play (or your opponent has a lot of Stalkers when you pressure), be sure to pull back immediately and start Immortal production.
- Against Stargate play, use your Photon Overcharge to push back any Oracles or Phoenix if your Stalker army is out of position.
- Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very versatile, safe build that takes advantage of early Gateway units to apply pressure as well as defend every sort of all-in that can hit you. It also gets detection and Immortals for defense against ground-based all-ins, so very often you have a more stable opening than most other PvP builds.

Invented by Flash but refined and popularized by INnoVation, this Reaper/Hellion 3CC variant is by far the most popular on ladder and is considered by the majority of Terran players to be the most standard of macro builds. Its versatility has stood the test of time, and the current version below will be continually updated as INnoVation continues to optimize it again and again.

Scouting

You can open with this build regardless of what your opponent is doing, so SCV scouting is unnecessary. You only need to SCV scout if you want to confirm that your opponent is opening Hatchery First and want to start a Bunker at their natural in order to begin Reaper/Bunker pressure.

The rest of your scouting will come from your Reapers and then later Reaper+Hellions poking the front and forcing your opponent to reveal what units they have in order to defend your attacks. Note: Ling Speed will finish around 3 minutes after your opponent takes an Extractor. Thus, if your initial SCV/Reapers see your opponent taking gas, be sure to send your Reapers back just before those 3 minutes are up and wait for some Hellions before attempting to engage Speedlings in the open field.

In case your Reapers or Hellions spot your opponent making Roaches or going for a Roach Warren, immediately cancel your next pair of Hellions and begin making Widow Mines and Marauders. Having your Widow Mines positioned effectively, and using SCVs to tank damage or repair your Bunker will be all you need to stay alive.

Be prepared to throw the timings of the second half of this build out assuming any serious aggression, such as a Roach Bane all-in.

Transitions

This build transitions well into both Marine/Tank or Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine because it sets up the basic infrastructure needed for either of those and gets Stimpack.

The above transition involving double barracks after hellions followed by double ebay is the standard transition. In the event of an extreme all in, such as Roach bane, immediately begin marauder, mine, and bunker production. Against a strong Roach timing it is advised to begin tank production while slightly delaying either your Starport or Engineering Bays; this is most demonstrated notably in INnoVations series against Hyun in the WCS 2014 Global Finals.

Another great transition if you have done some damage with your Reapers or Hellions is going for a Hellbat/Marauder follow-up attack. How Dragon does this is throw down an Armory as soon as you start your 3rd Command Center, and then make Hellbats constantly as soon as the Armory finishes.  Starting two Engineering Bays and going for a +1/+1 Marauder/Hellbat push is a great way to keep up the aggression against your Zerg opponent. Keep in mind that this sort of 3CC Hellbat aggression is far weaker than a two base committed Hellbat push.

Pros and Cons

This build was originally intended as an aggressive opener backed by strong macro. In modern TvZ, however, any competent Zerg player will easily deflect Reaper Hellion pressure with minimal losses, and gasless three hatches are becoming increasingly rare due to the benefits provided by opening either Speedlings or Roach aggression. As such, the major pro of this build should now be listed as the amount of information that the Reaper can provide; because Zerg cannot proxy any tech, you should be aware of what Zerg is doing most of the time. In this way, opening Reaper/Hellion is inordinately safer than simply opening Hellions, if only because of the information difference.

The weakness of this build traditionally had been hyper aggressive openers, such as fast Speedling rushes (which can be deterred by bunkers between your 2nd CC and your main ramp), Roach/Bane busts (which can be held with bunkers, repair, and either mines or hellions with Marauders), or even fast Muta play (which INnoVation countered by simply pushing at his normal time with three missile turrets at home).

The new biggest threat against this build, however, is Roach timings. Simply put, this build focuses very heavily on Hellion production, and delays all other AOE quite significantly (usually up until around 11+ minutes). As such, 1-1 Roach Busts, or fast 2-2 Roach Hydra max out attacks, or even Roach Hydra into Brood Lords are all excellent examples of builds in which players should quickly identify, cut Hellions, and immediately begin adapting their builds for the situation.

Learning this Build and the Difficulty Curve

This build is undoubtedly one of the hardest macro builds to learn in the game. Besides its extreme adherence to timings and linear sequences, it is also extremely punishing in every aspect; INnoVation has refined this build to the point of impracticability; over queueing means delaying Hellions; delaying Hellions delays your Barracks, delaying your Barracks delays your starport, and delaying your starport delays your entire 1-1 push. In short, a single mistake has many more long lasting impacts as opposed to a standard Terran build.

To go about learning this build, it is important to work on only one section at a time and to not try to do everything at once when you first start off, else you will immediately fail.

In the order of things to focus on (#1 being top priority, and #8 being the lowest priority)

1. Worker Production
2. Not getting supply blocked, not over queueing, and proper rallies for all structures
3. The build itself (for example, starting Hellions before 5:30, or double E-bay and 2nd gas geyser at 7:40) and its relevant timings
4. Taking your Third base on time
5. Scouting
6. Keeping your Reaper Hellion alive
7. Harassing
8. Micro (Sniping the first creep tumor, catching the transfer of drones to the third base, weakening Queens to force transfuses and decrease tumors, sniping active tumors, runbys, etc.)

In short, always defer to the priorities, and only move down the line as you can accomplish the others. Even if you kill 32 Zerglings with your Hellions, it is irrelevant if you Medivacs finish at 12 minutes instead of 10:20. Even if you land your third base at 8:30, it is irrelevant if you only have 26 SCVs at the time instead of 40-50 that INnoVation might have. And even if you plant every structure down perfectly at the allotted times, supply blocks, over queueing, poor rallies, and suboptimal worker distribution also grind this entire build to a screeching halt.

Focus on one step at a time, and continually re watch INnoVations replays of this build from his view to fully internalize the mechanics and decisions that make this build brilliant.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,Reaper,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,CommandCenter,GasScv,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Factory,SCV,SCV,CallMule,CommandCenter,SCV,LiftRaxFromReactor,OrbitalCommand,LandFactoryOnReactor,Marine,SCV,DoubleHellions,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleHellions,StimPack,Marine,SCV,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,DoubleHellions,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnFactory,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,EngineeringBay,EngineeringBay,Refinery,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Marine,SCV,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,InfantryArmorLevel1,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,SCV,SCV,SCV,LandRaxOnReactor,LandRaxOnReactor,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Refinery,Refinery,ReactorOnFactory,Starport,SCV,SCV,SCV,CallMule,CallMule,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,ConcussiveShells,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,Armory,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Refinery', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:29:22 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Hero Aggresive Stargate', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Gateway Expand and then transitions into light Gateway pressure in order to start the macro game with an economic advantage. Also, this build gets both a Stargate and a third base quite quickly for a Chargelot/Void Ray or pure Sky-toss unit composition in the late game.

Scouting

After the early game, be sure to scout for early Roaches from your opponent. If your opponent is performing an early 2 base all-in, then warp-in Sentries and make Void Rays from your Stargate instead of being aggressive with your initial 6 units. If your opponent has taken a third base or shows NO signs of aggression, then be sure to set up your proxy Pylon as soon as you can for the attack to hit before Zergling Speed can finish.

When you are attacking with your initial 6 units (2 Stalkers, 3 Zealots, and Mothership Core), your opponent must defend with whatever units he has. With this extra scouting information, be sure to react appropriately. If your opponent has opened with Roaches, then be sure to start Void Ray production earlier. If your opponent has opened without Zergling speed, then be sure to continue the 3gate attack, reinforcing with Zealots and Stargate units when you can. If your opponent has opened with Zergling speed, then be sure not to over-commit to the attack; rather, pull back and start your Stargate production appropriately. Also note that if you kill a Queen or two, you should reinforce with an Oracle first due to your opponent?s lack of anti-air.

Depending on how your attack has gone (especially if your opponent defended with opening fast Roaches), then you might not feel safe to take such a quick third Nexus. Instead, start a Forge and a few Cannons at your natural in order to play safe.

Transitions

This build is a macro build, so don?t commit multiple warp-ins to the initial 3gate attack unless you are confident in its success. Following up with the appropriate Stargate units and taking your 3rd Nexus/extra Assimilators is much more important than dealing a killing blow with these units.

HerO follows up this attack with a Forge and several Cannons at both his natural expansion and 3rd Nexus. He then starts 2 more Stargates and both Assimilators at his 3rd Nexus in order to make a mass Void Ray army. With his economic advantage, he ensures that no standard Roach/Hydra timing attacks can kill his Sky-toss army until it is already too powerful.

However, it is also possible to play with an sOs style transition, favoring mass Chargelot and only several Void Rays in order to make a beefier ground army.  Again, start a Forge (or two) for Cannons at the natural expansion and 3rd Nexus as well as for Ground Upgrades. Then start at least 4 Gateways for a healthy Gateway count and a Twilight Council to begin Zealot Charge before taking your 5th and 6th Assimilators at your 3rd Nexus.  Add in High Templar/Archons instead of more Void Rays as your gas count allows it.

Tips

- Because this is a macro build with only light pressure, commit almost all of your chronoboost on both your Nexus throughout the build.
- With your initial Stalkers, be sure to clear any stray Zerglings around your base that might scout your build. Then defend the building proxy Pylon until your first warp-in.
- As soon as you start your Stargate, you need to send out a Probe in order to set up an aggressive proxy Pylon
- During your 3gate attack, use your Stalkers to target-fire any Queens your opponent might use to defend with. If you can kill a Queen or two, then follow-up with an Oracle to deal a lot of damage. Also, be sure to use Time Warp on any Queens or Roaches so as to minimize your opponent?s mobility in the fight.
- Do NOT over-commit multiple warp-ins to the 3gate attack unless you are confident that you can do damage. Each warp-in that you use slows down your 3rd Nexus timing by at least 20 seconds.
- If your opponent defends with fast Roaches, then consider starting a Forge and several Cannons at your natural expansion before you take the 3rd Nexus.

Pros and Cons

This macro build is strong because it opens with some light aggression for harassment and scouting, while taking a rather quick 3rd Nexus behind it. Also, it is a safe Gateway Expand build because your 3gates and Stargate together are enough to defend most early Zerg all-ins. Finally, this build uses a Stargate for some decent harassment, a deterrent for Mutalisks, and an opening for a strong unit-composition in the midgame.

However, this build requires solid macro while simultaneously performing a timing attack, so may be quite hard for newer players. Also, this build is somewhat weak against a Zerg who takes minimal losses during the 3gate attack and is able to follow-up with a +1/+1 mass Speedling attack to kill your 3rd Nexus.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Nexus,MothershipCore,WarpgateUpgrade,Pylon,Stalker,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Stalker,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Stargate,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Phoenix,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,VoidRay,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Nexus', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:27:12 PM;

Then it follows up with a quick 3rd Command Center to get a leg up against a macro-oriented Protoss opponent.

Scouting

This macro build is a greedy build, so scouting for all-ins is important.  However, you cannot afford to (nor have any need to) scout with an SCV before 17 supply. When you get to your opponents base, check whether they have a natural expansion started at or before the 5 minute mark. If your opponent has not started a Nexus by around the 5 minute mark, and they have both gas geysers, then you can assume they are performing an all-in with either a Twilight Council or Stargate. Be prepared to delay your 3rd Command Center in favor of 2 more Bunkers at the front (or main if your opponent appears to be doing a Blink all-in) and/or a Turret per mineral line to deal with Oracles.

All of the midgame scouting will come from you pushing out and taking the middle watchtowers, attacking the front, and dropping the main once you have Medivacs out. Simply noticing what units and unit composition your opponent is using to defend should give you enough information about their midgame plans to make informed counters.

Transitions

Because of how much infrastructure and time has been spent on Bio play in this build, the only possible follow up is going for more Bio play and adding in Vikings+Ghosts (and Hellbats or Widow Mines for the late game) as you take more bases.

To transition into standard Bio play, get another Engineering Bay and an Armory to continue double upgrades, add-on a Reactor and Tech lab onto your 4th/5th Barracks, get all of your third bases Refineries, and throw down either a Ghost Academy or a 2nd Starport depending on whether your opponent is going for Colossi or High Templar.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong build because of the powerful economy you kick start with your initial CC First and quick third. Also, by avoiding early Widow Mine drops or harassing units and focusing completely on getting upgrades and Bio, your army is considerably stronger at the 10 minute mark than most other TvP builds. Finally, this build is strong because you get a fast Engineering Bay and excess minerals, and thus have the opportunity to throw down Bunkers/Turrets to deal with any sort of 1 base aggression that a Protoss player can throw at you.

However, this build is only safe if your scouting is effective. Misjudging that your opponent is going for a macro game instead of an all-in can cost you the game instantly. Also, there is no opportunity with this build to apply pressure before you finish Stim and Medivacs at the 10 minute mark because it is focused on economy instead of pressure.

Tips

- The main strength of this build is the economic advantage. Do NOT miss SCVs as you are taking bases and macroing up.
- You cannot afford to scout before 17 supply in order to afford the CC and Barracks on time, but scouting what your opponent is doing in the early game is crucial, so be sure to send an SCV to scout soon after you reach 17 supply.
- Build another Bunker or two at the front if a scan or your SCV scout finds that your opponent has not started an expansion around the 5 minute mark.
- If you are playing completely blind, build a Missile Turret in each mineral line to defend against the possibility of Oracles before they could possibly arrive.
- Once you have Stimpack and Medivacs, push out instantly to try and deny a third base from your opponent and/or get scouting information about what midgame tech choice your opponent is committing to. However, keep in mind that you are on 3 Orbitals, and so remember that your economy is far ahead, but your army supply is not.

This CC First build gets a ridiculously fast 3rd Command Center, taking your economy immediately into the midgame. Using Reactor Hellions for map control and scouting information, this build is also reasonably safe; your Hellions let you quickly react to any Zerg all-in and Widow Mines + 3 Orbitals provides a reasonable defense.

Scouting

Instead of worrying about early game Zerglings, Innovation just builds his Command Center on the high ground, and finishes a wall-off with the initial Barracks. Thus, Innovation does not scout at all until his first Hellions pop.  With these Reactor Hellions he takes map control, clears out any Zerglings at watchtowers, and pokes Zergs front to spot the Zergs third base, any buildings at the front, and any units that Zerg is making.

- If you see a ton of Speedlings, then make sure your Hellion micro is on point. Feel free to pull back behind your natural wall in order to more effectively deal with Speedlings.
- If you see Roaches, then immediately cut Reactor Hellion production and start making Widow Mines two at a time. Make a Marauder, and consider cutting SCVs in order to complete a wall-off at your natural and prevent your opponent from running past your Bunker/Widow Mines.
- If you see two Evolution Chambers, then assume your opponent is playing a macro game.
- Alternatively, if you see a third base, then you can also assume your opponent is playing a macro game.

After any early pressure is spotted or not spotted, lift off your third Command Center and take your third. Use your Hellions and Marines (now with Stim) to secure it. All mid-game scouting will come from your incoming push with your first Medivacs.

Transitions

This build transitions well into both Marine/Tank or Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine because it sets up the basic infrastructure needed for either of those and gets Stim, +1/+1, and Combat Shields. Its infeasible to transition into Mech because of how much infrastructure and time you have already committed to into Bio upgrades.

For either transition, secure your third base, take both Refineries at your third, start +2/+2, and produce a lot of Marines. When transitioning into Marine/Tank, start a Tech lab on your Factory as well as a second Factory to kick start your Siege Tank count. When transitioning into Bio/Widow Mine, produce a Reactor on your Factory and start cranking out Widow Mines as you abuse your mobile Marine/Medivac force to apply pressure to your opponent. A +2/+2 timing attack with several Siege Tanks or several Widow Mines, and a lot of Marines is a very strong timing to hit.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a ridiculously economic opener  CC First into 3 CC.  However, this build gets Reactored Hellions quite quickly in order to take map control as well as stay safe against early Speedling timings. Also, your Hellions are quite useful in terms of the scouting information they give you.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Jaedong 9 Pool', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a 9 Pool in order to apply a lot of early pressure to your opponent and keep them on one base, and then transitions into more macro oriented play with a Speedling follow-up.

Scouting

All of your scouting comes from your initial Overlords and your 10 Zerglings.  First scout where your opponent has spawned by sending your Overlord directly to one of the possible bases. Then use your first 6 Zerglings (with more rallied) to poke/prod your opponent?s base.
If you see your opponent?s natural Hatchery nearly done, then they have performed a Hatchery First opener and you can choose either to ignore the natural and attack their workers in the main or to focus exclusively on the natural and plan to bring it down. Note that you MUST do economic damage one way or another with your 10 Zerglings or you will fall behind economically.
If your opponent?s natural Hatchery is only just started, then they have performed a Pool First opener. Focus on canceling the natural Hatchery ? you won?t be able to do much damage in the main before their Spawning Pool finishes.
If your opponent does not have a natural, then go up into the main and check their gas count. Prepare against 1 base play of either Banelings or Roaches by focusing much more on Speedlings and potentially getting a Spine Crawler.

Transitions

You can use this opener to transition into any form of Zerg play. If you want to end the game immediately, you can put Drones back on gas and go for a 1 base Ling/Bane all-in.
More standard play ensues by starting your natural expansion as soon as possible and making only as many Speedlings as needed to be safe and have map control. For a Roach midgame, start a Roach Warren and Lair after your first 100 gas. Then, on 3 gasses, you can start Roach Speed and +1 Attack. For a Mutalisk midgame, get a Lair with your first 100 gas and saturate your 2 bases and 4 gasses as soon as possible. Start your Spire as soon as your Lair finishes.

Tips

- Attack his Drones in his main if he has performed a Hatchery First opener
- Attack his natural expansion if he has gone for a Pool First opener
- Scout his main if he has gone for a 1 base build
- Do NOT make too many Zerglings. It may seem tempting to try and kill your opponent with constant reinforcements, but slow Zerglings lose their effectiveness very quickly. Drones are much more important.
- Be sure to pull off of gas once you have mined 100 for Metabolic Boost. You need all of your Drones mining minerals in order to boost your economy into the midgame.

Pros and Cons

This build opens up with a 9 Pool in order to situate aggressively in a matchup known for its early game volatility. It also gets Metabolic Boost at a standard time, while still allowing for both macro or all-in transitions.
However, this build is obviously a lot less economical than most other ZvZ builds, so you must do some sort of economic damage with your initial 10 Zerglings or risk falling behind.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,CancelExtractor,Drone,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Queen,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,MetabolicBoost,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Overlord,InjectLarva', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:29:23 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Leenock 3 Base Ultra', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with fast upgrades and mass Speedlings to crush any midgame attacks. It then transitions into a strong 3 base Ultralisk timing to either cripple the Protoss opponent or outright win the game.

Scouting

Scout first with your 2 initial Zerglings, use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of the Protoss base depending on the map.   Check to see whether your opponent is Gateway expanding or Forge expanding. Be wary of early pressure if your opponent is Gateway expanding.
With your 7:00 overlord scout, consider adding a Baneling Nest if you are up against a Gateway timing. Make mass Speedlings to defend any 2 base ground plays or ramp up Queen production early to defend any 2 base air plays.
Against a 2 base Colossus push, consider adding a Spire for Corruptors if you need more defense. Also, regardless of whether or not you need to make Corruptors for defense, you should start Air upgrades in case of a Mutalisk switch after you have maxed out with your Ultralisk army.
Ideally, your Ultras should be out with +5/+3 around 15:50. Commit to an attack as soon as possible when these upgrades finish.  If you have yet to take a 4th base and Spire or Hydralisk Den by this stage in the game, get them now.

Transitions

There is no ?transition? per se.  If you can win the game with this push, then be sure to attack in an open position and take the game quickly. If you cannot win the game outright, then fall back on your 4 base economy and tech switch to whatever best counters your opponent?s army.

Tips

Against Pylon blocks

- If you want to try and guarantee the Hatchery being placed, send a Drone to your natural around 11/12 supply and hide it there. This might trick Protoss into thinking that you are going Pool first.  Note that this will not work every time, and it also will not stop a Protoss dedicated to Pylon blocking you.
- A 15 Pool/15 Hatch/15 Gas opener (or at worst ? if they fail to cancel the Pylon ? a 15 Pool/15 Gas/and Hatchery as soon as you can) will be fine in this case. The most important thing is starting your Extractor on time, not the natural Hatchery.
- Be sure to make 4-6 Zerglings to take the pylon down if you need to, and go up to 3 Queens as soon as you can ? just like normal.
- Once you place your Extractor, the first 100 gas goes to Metabolic Boost, and place your Evolution Chambers when you get to 175 gas like normal to transition back into the build.

The Engagement

- Bring your Queens to transfuse, and any optional Infestors or Banelings you made to force good engagements.
- Do NOT engage into a Protoss wall. You want to engage in as open an area as you possibly can for your melee army to do maximum damage.
- Do NOT engage without your queens in transfuse range unless you are sure you can take a strong fight. Strong creep spread with all of your Queens helps tremendously.
- Try to avoid Archons with your Zerglings; use the Ultralisks to tank those. Similarly, focus your Zerglings on Stalkers and Immortals; keep your Ultralisks away from those.
- If you use Ultralisks to crush any forcefields, Zerglings can actually deal with Colossi quite easily as they take minimal damage whilst underneath the Colossi.

Pros and Cons

This build is very strong against a ?standard? Protoss army of Gateway units, Colossi and some Stargate or Templar units. Also, this timing attack has the strong potential to end the game.
However, this build is somewhat simple for Protoss to scout and is vulnerable to timing attacks and all-ins when you only have upgraded Speedlings to defend. Also, if your Protoss opponent is positioned in a well defended location, the engage can be quite difficult to perform well.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Extractor,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Zergling,MetabolicBoost,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Queen,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,EvolutionChamber,EvolutionChamber,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,MeleeAttacksLevel1,GroundCarapaceLevel1,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,Lair,Overlord,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Overlord,Queen,InjectLarva,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,Extractor,Extractor,Queen,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Queen,Hatchery,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,MeleeAtacksLevel2,GroundCarapaceLevel2,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,Overlord,InfestationPit,SpawnCreepTumor,Queen,Queen,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Queen,Queen,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Hive,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Queen,Queen,Overlord,Overlord,Extractor,Extractor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Infestor,Infestor,Infestor,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,AdrenalineGlands,UltraliskCavern,MeleeAttacksLevel3,GroundCarapaceLevel3,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Hatchery,ChitinousPlating,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:29:59 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Jim 1 gate FE to Phoenix-Colossus', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a fast expansion in order to get an economic advantage, using an Oracle for harass potential and defense until you can setup a Phoenix/Colossus midgame unit composition.

Benchmark: When your Robotics Facility finishes (@7:00ish), you should have 1 Oracle, 1 Stalker, 1 Sentry, a Mothership Core, and around 37 Probes.

Benchmark: When your 2nd Colossus finishes (@10:00ish), you should have 2 Colossi, 3 Phoenix, 1 Stalker, 3 Zealots, 2 Sentries, and a Mothership Core with over 50 Probes.

Scouting

Feel free to Probe scout after you build your Gateway in order to determine what your opponent is building. The majority of information about what Terran is doing however will come from what your opponent hits you with.  If you spot a Reaper coming into your base, then try and stop it from seeing your building Stargate with your Stalker and Mothership Core (do not worry too much if it is spotted however, for your Stargate is only initially being used for one Oracle). If you do not spot a Reaper, then send your Mothership Core and use its huge sight range to spot what buildings your opponent has inside of his base before returning home.

The majority of your midgame scouting will come from your Oracle. Use it to spot whether your opponent is opening with Bio, going for fast upgrades, fast triple Command Center, or strong 2 base timing. If you see an opening, then the Oracle can be used to harass your opponents SCVs, but the true purpose of the Oracle is constant scouting through the midgame. Your opponents 3rd base timing is especially useful as a good benchmark for when you should try and take your 3rd base.

Transitions

The build transitions into a Phoenix/Colossus midgame, with a standard Colossus/High Templar/Archon late game. As soon as you spot your opponent taking his 3rd base, secure a third of your own, then start 2 Forges and several more Gateways. Keep producing Phoenix and Colossus until you have around 7 of each (7 is a LOT for a normal game, but the heavily delayed High Templar tech means that you have a stronger army in the midgame), supplementing your army with Zealots when you have extra minerals. Finally, when your +1/+1 is halfway done, be sure to start a Twilight Council for +2/+2, Zealot Charge, and Templar Archives in order to reach your lategame army.

Tips

- In the early game, you are attempting to get your economy up enough to support Phoenix/Colossus on 2 bases.  Be sure to chronoboost your Probes constantly until you need to divert chronoboost to your Robotics Facility/Stargate.
- Against Reaper play, position your initial Stalker and Mothership Core defensively.  Try to deny it scouting your Stargate, but dont worry if it is scoutedthe Stargate is only initially used for one Oracle.
- The main purpose of your initial Oracle is for scouting. While it is true that you can kill several SCVs if your opponents Marines are out of position, do NOT sacrifice your Oracle for a few extra kills. The constant threat of harass and ability to scout for the first 10 minutes of the game is a lot more important than an extra SCV kill or two.
- Position your Phoenix defensively outside your main (to absolutely shut down any midgame drops) up until you are ready to take your third.  If/when your Oracle dies, use your flock of Phoenix to take map control and kill several SCVs with any extra APM you have.
- Take your third base and start 2 Forges as soon as you spot your opponent taking his 3rd base.
- Build more Colossus (up to 7) than you normally would (around 4). With the extra air support tanking and killing Vikings, your Colossus count must be quite large in order to take out your opponents Bio army.

Pros and Cons

This build gets out an early Oracle for harass potential and constant scouting. It also gets a strong economy and uses a midgame Phoenix/Colossus unit composition to defend drops and bio pushes with ease. This midgame composition is quite robust in terms of defending your third as well as stopping constant Medivac harass.

However, this build is short on Gateway units for the early stages of the game. Thus, any early drops are quite hard to stop unless you are able to scout them beforehand and prepare appropriately. Also, you do not start your Forges until you start your third base, so you will often be behind in upgrades against a macro-Terran.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,MothershipCore,Nexus,GasProbe,GasProbe,WarpgateUpgrade,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,Probe,Stargate,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Probe,Oracle,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Observer,RoboticsBay,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Observer,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,ExtendedThermalLance,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Phoenix,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Phoenix,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Phoenix,Chronoboost', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:29:59 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Jaedong Roach Drop Nydus All-In', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This all-in hits your opponent?s main with a lot of speed Roaches. However, Jaedong puts his own clever flair on this traditional ZvT All-in by using an Overlord Roach Drop to guarantee his Nydus follow-up is successful.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of very early force, position your Queens to defend your natural and consider getting a Spine Crawler. Banshee play may be an issue with only 2 Queens, but such a fast Lair means you will have a very quick Overseer.
The next scout will be with your initial Roach Warren attack. Terran will be forced to defend his main with all his units, so you?ll see either Bio or Mech units to defend. These Roaches should be able to scout and do some serious economic damage ? hopefully enough to end the game with constant reinforcements from the Nydus Network.

Transitions

This build is a 2 base all-in that gets a lot of attacking units and very few Drones as well as upgrades that do not lend themselves towards the mid or late game. Therefore, there is no well-defined follow-up for the build, should your attack fail. However, if you do a lot of damage with the attack but lose your Nydus Network, be sure to follow-up with a 3rd Hatchery, a lot more Drones, and 2 Evolution Chambers to try to transition into normal play.

Tips

- Against a Reaper/Hellion player, save your Queen energy after you start 2 or 3 Creep Tumors. Having energy for Transfuse lets you push back any early attacks without revealing your Roaches.
- Hide your Roaches for as long as possible before you move out. The less time you give your opponent to react to your build, the better your chance at crushing through their front.
- Make 2 Overlords per inject cycle ? 8 Roaches takes up 16 supply.
- Bring an Overseer or two with your Roach attack so that you have detection against Widow Mines. Remember to split your Roaches to avoid splash damage from either Widow Mines or Siege Tanks.
- This attack is an all-in, so you have to kill your opponent with this attack. Don?t let your Roaches mess around attacking buildings or SCVs ? kill your opponent?s army as soon as possible.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any player going for a fast 3 Command Center build (the current metagame) because of how late their upgrades and army will be. Also, any build that gets both Roach drops AND Nydus Networks is a very fun all-in to play with.
However, this is an all-in, so if you cannot do game-ending damage with the Roach attack, you will be economically behind the Terran opponent.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,MetabolicBoost,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Overlord,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Lair,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,RoachWarren,Drone,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,VentralSacs,Overlord,Overlord,GlialReconstitution,PneumatizedCarapace,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,NydusNetwork,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,NydusWorm', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:29:59 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'MacSed 5gate', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build is a fast expand build that opens with a Mothership Core for defense, and then follows-up with a very quick 5gate timing with Zealots and Sentries to crush your opponent before they can even enter their midgame tech.

Scouting

After the early game, scouting is much more minimal than you might expect. As long as you can confirm your opponent is getting a third Hatchery (and sometimes even if they are not getting one), you should be able to go through with this build.

With your attack, you will be able to scout what units he is using to defend. If you are fighting mass Speedling, then constantly warp-in Zealots and Sentries.  If you are fighting Roaches, then constantly warp-in Stalkers. Your opponent should not be able to get out either Hydras or Mutalisks in time to defend this attack.

Transitions

If it appears that your opponent has way over-committed to defending your attack with units or Spine Crawlers, you can always retreat and go for the macro game. Either force field your opponent back and walk home or mass recall your army to your natural Nexus. A common follow-up to this build is starting a Robotics Facility and going for Colossi to deal with your opponent?s Roaches. Alternatively, you can go for a Stargate and make Phoenix in order to prepare for your opponent?s Mutalisks. Be sure to use Hallucinations often to check-up on what midgame tech your opponent is going for. Take a third base when you feel safe.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a Gateway expand, so your 5gate attack will hit very soon (before 7 minutes). This build usually hits your opponent before they have any midgame tech.

However, this build relies on you deflecting your opponent?s scouting information in order for it to be maximally effective.

This CC First build takes your economy immediately into the midgame and then transitions into a 9 minute, 2 base Marine/Hellion/Medivac timing with Stimpack.

Scouting

Build the Command Center on the high ground and then wall-off with your initial Barracks. This way, you will not have to worry about early Zerglings because you will have a full wall. Thus, SCV scouting is no longer necessary.

Your first scouting comes from the first Hellions you make. With these Reactor Hellions, you can take map control, clears out any Zerglings at watchtowers, and pokes Zergs front to spot the Zergs third base, any buildings at the front, and any units that Zerg is making.

If you see a ton of Speedlings, then make sure your Hellion micro is on point. Feel free to pull back behind your natural wall in order to more effectively deal with Speedlings.

If you see Roaches, then immediately cut Reactor Hellion production and start making Widow Mines two at a time. Delay your Starport for a little while in order to afford Marauders, and consider cutting SCVs in order to complete a wall-off at your natural and prevent your opponent from running past your Bunker/Widow Mines.

If you see two Evolution Chambers, then assume your opponent is playing a macro game.

Alternatively, if you see a third base, then you can also assume your opponent is playing a macro game.

Transitions

This build transitions pretty normally into standard Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine play as well as Marine/Tank/Medivac play in a pretty common manner. However, because of the resources and time you have devoted to Bio units and upgrades, this build cannot transition into Mech.

For either the Bio/Mine or Marine/Tank transition, as you are pushing out, instantly start your 3rd Command Center, Combat Shields, and 2 Engineering Bays. It is also strongly suggested that you continue Medivac and Marine production before adding on more Barracks so that you can continue unrelenting drop play and keep your opponent on their half of the map while you are attempting to take your own third and get into your comfortable late-game infrastructure. When your Engineering Bays finish, be sure to start your Infantry upgrades, all of your Refineries, and throw down up to 5 more Barracks to be able to pump out your 3 base army.

If you are going for Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine play, be sure to start a Reactor on your naked Factory and start Widow Mine production (adding a 2nd Factory with a Tech lab for the Widow Mine upgrade once you have later secured your third).

If you are going for a Marine/Tank/Medivac play, be sure to start a Tech lab on your naked Factory and start Siege Tank production (adding a 2nd Factory with a Tech lab once you have later secured your third).

Tips

- Do NOT over commit with your initial Hellions. Use them exclusively for scouting purposes in the early game; their true purpose is to bolster your ground army in the actual Marine/Hellion/Medivac timing attack.
- Against any all-ins with this build, you must rely on your Bunker placement, SCV control, and scouting it coming. Be active on the map with your first Hellions so that you know what is coming your way before it gets to your doorstep.
- Feel free to push out with your Bio army even before Stimpack/Medivacs are even done. As long as you have Hellions scouting in front to ensure you are not being all-inned, your Bio army can be walking across the map while your Medivacs boost in behind them so that you hit your opponent the second Stimpack finishes.
- Do NOT clump up against Banelings. Your opponent should not be able to have that many Banelings by the 9 minute attack, but be sure to spread your army and micro appropriately if you see Banelings on the field.
- Remember to pick up your Marines into the Medivacs and boost away as soon as your army is finally overtaken. Keeping your opponent on their side of the map while you set up your own third base is crucial.
- Save at least one scan to kill creep. As a Zerg, losing your initial midgame creep and a Queen or two spreading it can be devastating for the later stages of the game.

Pros and Cons

This build opens quite economically, and then transitions into making a strong army and hitting your opponent with a lot of units at the 9 minute mark before they can even stabilize their third base economy. It is a very strong build for punishing greedy Zergs.

However, while it is a CC First opener that is not at all all-in, it is definitely not nearly as macro-oriented as the standard Reactor Hellion 3CC build or other 3CC builds such as Polts Map Control Build. Also, if your opponent can see it coming and overproduces units to defend, you will have to pick up and rely on drop play instead of a large frontal assault to get an advantage.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Bunker,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SCV,CallMule,Factory,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,SCV,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Refinery,TechLabOnBarracks,CallMule,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,StimPack,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marauder,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Starport,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleHellions,SCV,Marauder,SCV,CallMule,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,Marauder,DoubleMedivacs,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnFactory,Marauder,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:29:59 PM;

This is a highly aggressive, 1 base 1/1/1 all-in which focuses on early harass to damage your opponent while simultaneously building up army for a follow-up all-in. While this build has the potential to fall back into a macro game, transitioning into the midgame is difficult if early damage is not inflicted on the opponent.

Scouting

This build gives you several opportunities for scouting. Your first bit of information comes from getting your scouting SCV into his base between 12 and 16 food. If you manage to get your SCV into your opponents base, check for how many Refineries your opponent has. If your opponent does not have gas, they will most likely be doing a 1rax FE build. This presents one of the better scenarios for your early game Hellion drop to workespecially if your opponent does not anticipate the Hellion drop. If your opponent has one Refinery, it likely means that your opponent will be going for Reapers, have a Marine/Hellion defense, or have a Marine/Widow Mine defense. With your Hellions drop, do not over commit, simply keep your opponent busy. If your opponent attempts to Hellion expand, he will pull ahead economically assuming his defense prevents your hellions from inflicting any damage. You will most likely not see a second gas geyser with your SCV scout.

Once you have your first Hellions out, you should have full map control by clearing any XelNaga Towers and poking the front. Running in to spot your opponents natural is also a smart move, but be sure to pull back if there are any units defending. Your Hellions are there to increase the effectiveness of your later all-in, not to end the game early on.

Lastly, when you Hellion drop in his main, you should finally be able to see everything your opponent has gone for. If your opponent has gone for Cloaked Banshees, it will not instantly be a threat because he will need to keep the Banshee in his base to defend his workers. Later, once you have a Raven, Banshees will no longer be an issue. If your opponent has gone for Hellions of his own, be careful when out on the map, and always favor retreating if your Hellions are in danger. If your opponent has gone for Widow Mines, be sure to avoid obvious spots where he could have placed them.

Ideal Game

Your Hellion drop should inflict some kind of damage to your opponent and keep him occupied with defensive measures. However, even while doing damage with them, it is important to keep them alive. With ideal Hellion harass, your later all-in will overwhelm your opponent or trade in your favor.

If your opponent is prepared for the all-in engagement, he will most likely have either a Bunker, Siege Tanks, or both to defend. Your Hellions from earlier can help clear SCVs repairing the Bunker. Assuming you need to siege and push slowly because he has Tanks, consider dropping your Hellions again to divert some forces and his attention. However, remember that every unit is precious, so do not over commit with this drop.

Transitioning

In the situation where you cannot straight up win the game with your all-in but still have him contained, consider expanding and transitioning into Marine/Tank play or Mech. Simply throw down an expansion, take more gas, and ramp up your production from there.

If the all-in fails and your opponent is ahead economically, then you will have most likely lost the game. However, expanding and defending this base with Siege Tanks can still be a last-ditch option.

Tips

- With your first two Hellions, clear the XelNaga Watchtowers and take map control.
- During your Hellion drop, be sure to constantly pump Marines from your Reactored Barracks and produce Siege Tanks.  The strength of this build is the follow-up all-in, not the initial Hellion drop.
- Do NOT lose your Hellions when dropping them.  Use the Medivac boost to get your Hellions out of there if they are ever in danger.
- When moving out, be sure to bring 2 SCVs to repair.
- Slowly siege your opponent unless you are sure you can crush through the front.
- Remember to use Seeker Missile or Auto Turrets from your Raven to push the fight in your favor.

Pros and Cons

This build is a 1-2 punch of sortsfirst hitting with a Hellion drop and then following up with a Marine/Tank all-in. It is often too much for expanding opponents to handle and quickly ends the game. The Hellion drop can also be deadly harass if your opponent does not scout it or defend appropriately.

However, because this build was created by MarineKing himself, it is quite micro intensive, and thus is hard to pull off as a lower league player.

This PvT opener opens with early Oracles to smash through un-upgraded marines and harass your opponents mineral line, all while taking an expansion back at home and transitioning into the midgame.

Scouting

This build opens aggressively with lots of units, so there is no need to be worried about early pressure. However, in order for you to control your Oracles well and attack in the correct places, it is necessary to know what your opponent is building. Thus, use your early game map control with your Stalkers and Mothership Core to poke in and see whether your opponent is going for Widow Mines/where they are building Turrets/how they have positioned their Marines so that you will know when and how to attack with your oracles.

Transitions

This build transitions into any normal midgame that you would like. At around the 8 minute mark, plant down either a Robotics Facility or Twilight Council to start your teching into Colossus or High Templars+Storm. Then, after your Oracle harass has finished, you will already be halfway to your desired tech. Getting more gateways down and the upgrades (+1 Ground Armor and Charge/Storm) started while you are harassing your opponent is very important.

Alternatively, you can go for a Phoenix/Colossus midgame army. Plant down a Robotics Facility at around the 8 minute mark and tech straight for Colossi on 4 Assimilators. When your Robotics Bay finishes, start 2 more Gateways, start your first Colossus, and begin producing Phoenix in order to re-converge to a play style akin to Jims Phoenix/Colossus Build.

Tips

- Use your first Stalker to deny an SCV/Reaper scout and keep your opponent in the dark as to what build you are going.
- Rally your Oracles to an airspace near your opponents base so that your push happens as soon as you are ready.
- The Mothership Core can poke in and around your opponents main base to see what tech buildings they have and/or what units they are building.
- Go in with your first Oracle if they opened with gas to start applying pressure soon. If you wait for 3 or 4 Oracles, a Widow Mine drop might be already on the way and you would not be able to defend it.
- Wait for more Oracles if they opened gasless 1rax FE and your stalkers have not been able to do any damage. If you go in too soon, then theyll just build a reactive missile turret and shut down your later Oracles.
- Remember: Oracles scale REALLY well. 3 Oracles can take down up to 10 marines without losing a single Oracle.  Be aggressive vs marines, and super defensive vs turrets/widow mines.
- Do not forget to include the Mothership Core in the fight  its DPS and Time Warp spell are very useful when taking out marines/units.
- Start that midgame transition BEFORE you focus on the harass in your opponents base so that after the Oracle harass has finished, you will already be halfway to your desired midgame tech.

Pros and Cons

This build gives you map control and hits your opponents with a lot of early game Oracles to destroy a mineral line. It is strong because Oracles absolutely destroy un-upgraded marines, and are maneuverable enough that they can track down and run after SCVs.

However, opening with this build delays your expand a lot more than if you had opened straight 1gate FE. Because you have less economy, the midgame Terran timing attacks with medivacs are even scarier than normal (unless you do damage with your Oracles), so you actually have to do damage to attempt to transition into the midgame. Remember that Oracles have very little health, so you have to babysit your units if you have any hope of not losing them instantly to a well placed Missile Turret/Widow Mine.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,MothershipCore,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Stargate,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Oracle,Probe,Nexus,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Chronoboost,Oracle,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Oracle,Probe,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:29:59 PM;

This build opens up with a quick 3 base economy to stay safe against any early Terran shenanigans as well as give you enough power to hit a strong Zergling/Baneling timing before your Terran opponent can get their 3 base economy rolling. One main strength of this build is that the timing push is not all-in, but rather a tool to get you safely to the familiar position of Mutalisks and 4 bases without having to deal with unrelenting Terran pressure.

Scouting

Note the 7:00 Overlord scout to check whether your opponent is going for Bio or Mech. Do not continue with this build order if your Overlord scout spots your opponent going for Mech.
If you scout a Reaper/Hellion/Banshee opener, keeping your Queens alive without Metabolic Boost is quite difficult. Instead of blindly rushing into this build, get a few Spine Crawlers and 1 Spore Crawler per mineral line with an extra Spore or two between the natural and 3rd Hatchery.  It is fine to commit a lot to defense in this situation as going Reaper/Hellion/Banshee slows down any Bio/Mine pushes considerably.
By the time you attack just after 11 minutes, you must know how Terran is going to defend. Run a Zergling or two at Terran?s wall where you want to bust through to spot what army composition is waiting.
- If you scout Bio/Mine, continue as normal with the initial bust.
- If you scout Marine/Tank, consider continuing the bust. However, if you see more than one Siege Tank, be sure to retreat and build your Spire/Creep/Hive!
- If you scout Mech this late, you have most likely already lost. Transitioning into Mutalisks or Swarm Hosts instantly may be enough to keep you alive, but know that you have committed a lot of resources to a bust that cannot succeed.

Transitions

Once you perform the bust, you will either outright win the game, do a little bit of economic damage and trade armies, or completely fail without doing any serious damage. In either of the first two cases, continue to deny the most recent Terran base (either an undefended 3rd, or a future 4th if their 3rd is well established), and continue to play the macro game. If your bust has completely failed, then you can attempt to play the macro game with your 5 Hatcheries already done, but note that you have committed and subsequently a lost of resources going into the macro game.
In a macro game, go up to Hive tech when you most prefer. Some Zergs delay it, some get it faster. Life is known for getting it for +3/+3 and faster Ultralisks. Eventually transitioning into Ultralisk/Queen/Infestor is a solid end-game unit composition ? just be sure that you have enough static defense to deny doom drops and stop Terran from spreading you too thin as you attempt to create this scary army.

Tips

- Against any early pressure, your Queens and a Spine Crawler are all the defense you will need.  With a later Metabolic Boost, you cannot rely on Speedlings to help defend any 1 base all-ins.
- Do your best to clear the map of any of your opponent?s Hellions BEFORE you are ready to bust. Being able to spawn your Banelings close to your opponent as opposed to back at your base makes this bust a lot more effective.
- Get an Overseer before the initial bust to help clear any Widow Mines. However, this build hits early enough that there should not be too many Widow Mines up just yet for you to worry about.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any player going for a Tank-less 3 Command Center build (the current metagame). Also, because you saturate your third base before moving out, it is quite easy to stop Zergling/Baneling production and transition into a macro game with a strong economic advantage.
However, this build sacrifices quick Mutalisks in lieu of more Zerglings and Banelings, so early drops can be a problem. Also, with such a heavy melee army, you have to be wary of Widow Mine detonations destroying your entire army.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Queen,InjectLarva,Queen,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Overlord,SpawnCreepTumor,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,MetabolicBoost,EvolutionChamber,EvolutionChamber,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Queen,SpawnCreepTumor,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,MeleeAttacksLevel1,GroundCarapaceLevel1,Overlord,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Lair,Hatchery,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,BanelingNest,Extractor,Extractor,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,SpawnCreepTumor,Hatchery,SpawnCreepTumor,CentrifugalHooks,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,MeleeAtacksLevel2,GroundCarapaceLevel2,InjectLarva,Overlord,Overlord,SpawnCreepTumor,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,SpawnCreepTumor,Overseer,Overseer,Overseer', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:29:59 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Maru Reaper FE to Hellbat-Banshee Push', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE transitions into a fast 2 base Hellbat Banshee timing in order to crush your opponent early regardless of whether or not they open with Roaches.

Scouting

Use your Reaper to poke around your opponents natural and ascertain whether or not they are performing an early all-in. Later, when you have Hellions out, poke the front to ensure that your opponent is taking a 3rd base and not performing some delayed 2 base all-in. Favor keeping your Hellions alive over getting more scouting information/killing Drones because you will need every Hellion later for the Hellbat Banshee timing.

During your actual attack, be sure to note whether your opponent is defending with Roaches (which means a potential Roach/Hydra midgame, or at the very least delayed Mutalisks) or with Ling/Bane (which means a probable Ling/Bane/Muta midgame, and a more standard Mutalisk timing).

Transitions

This build opens with a 1/1/1 and therefore does not yet commit to a Bio or Mech midgame. It can in fact transition into either quite easily.

For a Bio (+Hellbat or Widow Mine) transition, start your 3rd Command Center as you swap off your Barracks onto the Starports Tech lab in order to start Stimpack research, 2 Engineering Bays, and 4 more Barracks. Use non-Stimpack Medivac drops to delay your opponent while you get up the necessary midgame infrastructure.

For a Mech transition, start your 3rd Command Center, 2 Factories, and 2 more Refineries. Continue Banshee production to deal with a Roach counter-attack as well as take advantage of the delayed Mutalisk tech.

Tips

- Use your initial Marine to try and pick off an early scouting Overlord as well as deny early Drone scouts.
- Your Reaper is not meant to deal damage, but rather give you some basic scouting and map control.
- Do NOT over-commit your Hellions while scouting around your opponents base; you will need all of them for the followup Hellbat Banshee timing to be effective.
- Try and position a Marine or two inside your base to shoot down any scouting Overlords.
- During the actual Hellbat Banshee attack, be sure to stutter step into Roaches and Queens, and spread/kite Zerglings and Banelings.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong 2 base all-in that can outright kill an unsuspecting Zerg opponent, and at the very least forces a huge response in order to defend. By forcing your opponent to make an army, you keep both of your economies low and extend the midgame (where Terran is arguably best in TvZ). Also, this build is better than an exclusively Hellbat attack because of Banshees effectiveness against Roaches.

However this attack requires a lot of micro in order to keep up with a rally of Hellions and Banshees. Also, it is a 2 base build, so has a much smaller economy than standard macro play.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Reaper,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,Factory,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,LiftRaxFromReactor,ReactorOnBarracks,CallMule,SCV,Starport,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SCV,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,DoubleHellions,Refinery,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnStarport,SCV,SCV,CallMule,CallMule,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleHellions,SCV,SCV,CloakingField,Banshee,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Armory,SCV,SCV,DoubleHellions,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,Banshee,CallMule,DoubleHellions', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:29:59 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'NaNiwa Zealot-Immortal All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Gateway Expand and then transitions into a very quick all-in with 2 Immortals, a Warp Prism, and a lot of +1 Zealots.

Scouting

After the early game, scouting is much more minimal than you might expect. As long as you can confirm your opponent is getting a third Hatchery, you should be able to go through with this build.

However, if your opponent scouts your Robotics Facility early on, then you can send your Warp Prism directly towards your opponent?s base in order to both fake pressure and see what units/buildings they have made.  This Warp Prism poke provides a bit of scouting that may help you deduce what unit composition your opponent will try to defend your all-in with.

Transitions

This build is a 2base all-in, so there is no standard way to follow-up this build should the attack not outright win the game. If your opponent holds off your all-in without taking too much damage, then you will most likely lose the game soon after. That being said, starting more Assimilators and teching to either Colossi or Blink Stalkers (depending on what unit composition your opponent used to defend your all-in) for a second desperation all-in might just be enough to win the game.

Tips

- The limiting factor in this build is the Robotics Facility time. Be sure to chronoboost your Robotics Facility to get out the Warp Prism and Immortals in time for such a fast attack.
- Send your Warp Prism to your opponent?s base as soon as it completes for both fake pressure and potential scouting information.
- When you move out for the attack, be sure to fully wall-off your natural expansion (and even potentially build some cannons) to stop your opponent from running around your army and going for a base trade.
- The most important part of the army are your Robotics units. Keep your Zealots all in front of your Immortals/Warp Prism so that they tank all (or most) incoming damage. Using the Warp Prism, pick up Immortals that are being targeted down to move them further back behind your Zealot meat shield. If your Warp Prism is being targeted down, bring it out of the fight and retreat a bit before warping in more Zealots.
- If your opponent is trying to defend with Roaches or Mutalisks and you have a little extra gas, then mix in some Stalkers into the mix for some extra DPS.

Pros and Cons

This is a strong all-in that hits before your opponent can have much tech out in order to end the game quickly. With +1 Zealots dealing lots of damage to Zerglings, and Immortals shredding up Roaches, this build walks through most Zerg defenses with ease.

However, none of your units are anti-air. Thus, if your opponent gets out Mutalisks before your attack has dealt lots of damage, then you will be in a lot of trouble. Also, losing a single Immortal or the Warp Prism due to poor micro can almost instantly lose you the game.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Nexus,MothershipCore,WarpgateUpgrade,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Probe,Forge,Gateway,Probe,Zealot,Probe,Probe,WarpPrism,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Immortal,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Immortal,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,Pylon,Observer,Chronoboost,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:30:02 PM;

Because this build opens with as many different map control units as Terran has, there is no need for super early SCV scouting. Your initial scout comes from your Reaper(s) poking into your opponents base. Check for a lack of a natural, early gas, or any quick tech buildings. Consider cutting Hellions and getting Widow Mines instead if your opponent is going for a very early all-in.

The next scout comes from your Reapers and Hellions poking the front.  You should be able to spot a 3rd base and your opponents Queen count.  If you see a lack of Queens and no 3rd base, then be prepared for a 2 base all-in of sorts. Extra bunkers, a full wall-off, and Marauders/Siege Tanks are the best ways to defend most Roach or Baneling based all-ins.

Finally, your last scout comes from a Medivac drop and your Viking. Use your Viking to kill Overlords blocking your 3rd base or scouting around the map. You can also use the Viking to keep tabs on your opponents base count up until they have any anti-air (usually Mutalisks). Be sure not to lose the Viking to Queens, however, so stay off creep. Also, use your Medivac drop for map control at the front. Scan, kill creep, and pick up and leave with your 8 units up everywhere your opponent is spreading creep until your opponent has Mutalisks.

This build gets you map control in every way: initial ground control comes from your Reapers; follow-up ground control comes from your Reaper/Hellion pokes; follow-up air control comes from your Viking on Overlord-killing duty; and follow-up creep control comes from a squadron of Marine/Marauder in your Medivac. Be sure to use all of these to their fullest in order to have maximum scouting information.

Transitions

This build transitions well into both Marine/Tank or Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine. It can also transition into Mech, but anyone who watches Polt as a player knows that he never goes Mech in basically any matchup, so I have opted not to write-up the Mech transition.

For either transition, start Stimpack research and 2 Engineering Bays so that your midgame army will have some staying power on the field. Once you have minerals, throw down up to 7 Barracks and an extra Factory to reach the 3 base infrastructure that you need to out-produce your Zerg opponent. Start producing Siege Tanks or Widow Mines from your initial Factory to get a healthy unit count while you are building up your Bio army.

Lift up your third base and take your third once you feel safe, starting an Armory so as to continue your upgrades. Remember to stay on top of your huge mineral count. Because this build only stays on 3 buildings for unit production for quite some time, but gets you a similar income, your mineral income will seem much larger than you think. Start those Engineering Bays and Barracks as soon as you can afford them for a strong midgame army.

Tips

- Do NOT over commit your initial Reapers by trying to kill Drones. Use them more for scouting and prioritize keeping them alive so as to keep your opponents early game units back at home.
- Do NOT over commit your initial Reaper/Hellion poke by trying to kill Drones. Again, use them more for scouting and prioritize keeping them alive unless you see a huge opening that you can punish (such as spotting your opponents Queens off creep and knowing that your opponent does not have Zergling Speed).
- If you spot your opponent going all-in, then be sure to stop map-control-unit production and instantly begin Widow Mines and Marauders. Adding an extra Bunker and/or completing your wall-off at your natural will help provide buffers against any incoming attacks as well.
- When your Viking pops, be sure to shoot down as many Overlords as you can. Simply shift-queue up an attack route around all of your side of the map in order to kill any Overlords your opponent has that are off creep.
Use your initial Medivac and several Marines/Marauders for creep-killing duty. Scan, kill creep, and pick up and leave with your 8 units up everywhere your opponent is spreading creep until your opponent has Mutalisks. Try and pick off a Queen if you can.
- Once you throw down your 3rd Command Center, you are going to have A LOT of minerals. Be sure to transition quickly by starting the Engineering Bays, Barracks, and Refineries as soon as you can afford them.

Pros and Cons

This build is quite strong because of its ability to scout and harass early on.  With Reapers, Hellions, Vikings, and Medivacs all being used to take map control, and a 1/1/1 at home with the versatility to react to whatever units your opponent seems to be making, this build is also quite safe against any early all-ins that your opponent might try to do. Finally, if your opponent ever slips up and does not adequately prepare for your continuous production of map control units, you can quickly kill many Drones and take a huge economic advantage as what happens in game 5 of Polt vs HyuN.

However, this build is not quite as economical as a 3CC build such as Innovations Reactor/Hellion 3CC build. It also requires a lot of APM in order to micromanage all of your early game harassing/map control units while keeping up your macro at home. Finally, it delays Stimpack by several minutes when compared to most other builds, so all of your early aggression must come from Stimpack-less Bio units and your map control units.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Reaper,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Factory,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Starport,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleHellions,SCV,Marine,Viking,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,Marine,SCV,DoubleWidowMines,SCV,SCV,Marine,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Marine,CommandCenter,Medivac,SCV', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:30:03 PM;

This cheese proxies your initial Pylon at your opponent?s natural and makes Stalkers 2 at a time from 2 proxied Gateways. This proxy Stalker Rush is a very effective cheese that focuses on early game micro to destroy your opponent before the midgame.

Scouting

This build skips all scouting, for you are placing your first Pylon proxied at your opponent?s natural expansion regardless of what your opponent is doing. All of your scouting will come from your initial attack with your first Gateway units. The build itself will not change regardless of what you scout ? only your unit positioning and micro.

Transitions

This proxy Stalker Rush is an all-in in every respect: proxying the initial Pylon at your opponent?s natural, cutting Probe production at 12, non-stop chronoboosting your Gateways, and skipping Warpgate Research. Thus, there is no well-defined transition. If you are late in your execution and do not outright kill your opponent (or at least take out their army and 10+ Probes), then you will most likely lose the game to any sort of Gateway attack follow-up.

Tips

- ALL OF YOUR CHRONOBOOST MUST BE DUMPED INTO YOUR GATEWAYS. The limiting factor on this build is how fast you can pump out units from your Gateways. Be sure to non-stop chronoboost your Gateways as they are producing the Zealot and later Stalkers so as to attack as early as possible.
- Poke in with your first Zealot and Probe and force your opponent to lose mining time. However, be wary of a Probe surround. Favor keeping the Zealot alive over killing enemy Probes.
- Once your first 2 Stalkers finish, you must commit to the attack as quickly as possible and never stop Stalker production until either you have won the game or you have lost all of your units. The strength of this all-in is how quickly and ferociously it attacks, but if you are not constantly attacking then your opponent?s economic advantage can destroy you.
- If your opponent pulls a lot of Probes to defend, be sure to back off and fight near the main ramp. Use your 18 Pylon to buffer damage and provide high ground vision for your Stalkers to shoot up the cliff.

Pros and Cons

This proxy Stalker Rush is a hyper-aggressive all-in that is able to get 2 Stalkers and 1 Zealot at your opponent?s base at 4:00. Because of how quickly this build attacks, it can punish most greedy PvP builds or players with poor micro with ease.
Unfortunately, this all-in can be scouted because your initial buildings must all be built in your opponent?s natural.  However, it being easy to scout and easy to defend are two fundamentally different things, so you can still win with this build quite often.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Gateway,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Zealot,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Stalker,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Stalker,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:30:03 PM;

This build opens with a Nexus First and only enough units to secure a ridiculously fast 3rd base. With a 3 base economy, it then hits a 9 minute 7 gate attack comprised of mainly Stalkers and Sentries.

Scouting

This build opens incredibly greedily, so be sure that your opponent is expanding and droning with an initial Probe scout. Besides any initial Probe(s), however, this build does not give you any tools with which to scout your opponent. The majority of your scouting will come with the actual attack at 9 minutes.

Transitions

This build can either all-in or transition comfortably into a macro game.

If you are choosing to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly warp-in and chronoboost your Gateways, set up several proxy Pylons around your opponent?s third base, and stop all Probe production.

If you are choosing to play the macro game, then only use the attack to hopefully deal a bit of damage while you continue producing Probes and teching at home. Getting a Twilight Council, all of your gasses, and going for a +2 Blink Stalker army is a good choice.  Alternatively, you can start a Robotics Facility, all of your gasses, and go straight for Colossi.

Tips

- Spend all of your early game chronoboost on your two Nexus to maximize Probe production.
- Keep your Mothership Core out in front of your natural to help ward off any scouting Zerglings.
- Until you are ready to attack, position your Sentries and Zealot very defensively. Staying against buildings or walls will increase the effectiveness of defensive force fields dramatically.
- Use 2 of your Gateways to wall-in a Photon Cannon while your third base is being set up. A Cannon that cannot be targeted by Zerglings is incredibly effective at stopping runbys.
- Be sure to start moving out before +1 actually finishes in order to hit your opponent as early as possible.
- Constantly warp-in Stalkers with the attack, using your initial 8 Sentries to keep back enemy Roach/Ling armies.
- Don?t forget to mass recall your army back home if you end up getting surrounded.

Pros and Cons

This build is an incredibly greedy build that initially powers economy hard and then transitions into a powerful 7 Gate attack. You have both a strong army and a strong economy.

However, this build does not get much tech before the attack.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker back to the protection of your Sentries/Force fields and warp-in units quickly if you have to defend an early attack.

The majority of your scouting comes from your Hallucinated Phoenix. Your phoenix should be able to get into your opponents main base and determine what tech route you see your opponent going.

- If your opponent is expanding quickly, then feel safe. Consider going for a midgame Immortal+Gateway bust.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then be sure that you do not fall behind in the Immortal/Colossus count going into the midgame. Do NOT over produce Stalkers.
- If your opponent has a Stargate, then be sure to not take damage against early Phoenix or Oracles. Produce several Stalkers to initially protect your mineral lines, but consider getting a Stargate of your own or going for a quick Blink timing in order to truly stay safe against your opponent. Keep a tabs on when they take their natural expansion  a 3gate Stargate attack can be deadly if you are skipping too many warp-ins or teching too aggressively.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then make one Observer for detection against DTs and constantly produce Immortals. Also be sure to position your army/Mothership Core defensively in order to safely defend any Blink attacks.

Transitions

This build is a very strong macro opener that transitions into a macro game quite easily. However, the actual unit composition of that macro game very often depends completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with. If your opponent stays on one base for too long, then throw down more Gateways, constantly make units, and prepare to defend your natural with Stalkers, Immortals, and your Planetary Nexus. In Robotics vs Stargate macro games, quickly switch into Blink or Stargate play of your own so as to not lose against any Void Ray based armies. In Robotics vs Robotics macro games, Immortal count and/or Colossus count are the most important things.  Keep tabs on your opponents tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Robotics vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponents potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by producing Immortals+Gateway units or Colossus for defense.

Tips

- Use all your initial chronoboost on Probes so as to establish your economic advantage going into the midgame.
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial Stalker to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Traps 3gate All-in).
- Against all 1 base attacks, you must defend using your Planetary Nexus. To maximize your protection, save your Mothership Core energy as long as possible  only calling in your Planetary Nexus once your opponent has committed to attacks. Be sure to constantly chronoboost Immortals out for maximum DPS against ground-based armies.
- Against Blink play, be sure to position some of your army and an Immortal or two in your main base to destroy any Stalkers that blink up outside the range of your Planetary Nexus.
- Against Stargate play, be sure to warp-in some initial Stalkers and position your units to defend both mineral lines from potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very versatile, macro build that takes advantage of the power and range of your Planetary Nexus in order to stay safe against early attacks. It also gets detection and Immortals for defense, so very often you have a more stable opening than most other PvP builds.

However, defending early Stargate play can be quite tricky as your Robotics Facility does not help at all in producing anti-air units.

This gas first Banshee opener used by Polt and many other top level Korean Terrans opens with the fastest Cloaked Banshees possible. The Banshee(s) are used to stay safe against early attacks as well as harass your opponent, in order to get an economic advantage going into the midgame.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your Orbital Command to check whether or not your opponent is opening with Reapers. Against an opponent opening Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe; thus, you should try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or expanded at your natural with your first few Marines.

Your next scout will come with your Banshee. With this Banshee, you can check what your opponents opener is. Against another Banshee player, follow-up your first Banshee with a Raven (and then potentially Viking if extra anti-air is needed). Against a Hellbat dropping player, make a few Widow Mines to burrow defensively against any incoming drop, as you use several Banshees to out-harass him. Against a player going for a Widow Mine Drop, position your Marines defensively at home and be sure to have enough scans to deal with his Widow Mines. Building a Raven might be useful, but not until after you have 2 Banshees with which to harass your opponent.

Finally, be sure to keep an eye out on what midgame transition your opponent is doing. Look for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either all-in, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play quite easily.

For an all-in transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory and start Siege Tank production instantly. When you hit 2 or 3 Siege Tanks, grab all of your Marines (>20), your Banshees/Vikings, and attempt to break your opponents front with a slow siege push.

It is possible to go into Marine/Tank or Mech after a 3 Command Center follow-up if you are sure your opponent will not be going for any more early game pressure. Start a Raven in order to save enough minerals to afford 2 Command Centers and then transition into either Marine/Tank or Mech just as below.

When transitioning into macro Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production after you start a 2nd Command Center. That way you have enough defense early and later can have a strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use. Against 2rax Reaper, you should delay your Tech lab until your Factory has completed at least one Hellion. Otherwise you might straight up die before you even start your first Banshee.
- Watch for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop your Banshee as you enter your opponents base.  Cloak your Banshee as soon as you see any potential for burrowed Widow Mines.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that are undefended by a Turret. If you are transitioning to a 1/1/1 all-in, then be sure to target-fire Marines as well, for this directly strengthens your attack.
- Always favor keeping your Banshee(s) alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two. You can also repair a weakened Banshee at home with SCVs if you can keep it alive.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural.  You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This gas first Banshee build is an aggressive opener in TvT. Also, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for you are able to transition into an all-in, 3 Command Center play, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play. Also, this build requires a lot less APM than other TvT builds, so it can be very useful for lower league players.

However, this build is extraordinarily weak against early Reaper builds because you open with so few Marines. Also, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind your opponent in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades, especially if they open with a fast expansion.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Proxy Thor Drop', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build rushes for Thors and a Medivac as fast as possible and then goes for a hilarious all-in with Thor Drops. There is no transition with this build  you pull all your SCVs and crush your opponent as soon as possible.

Scouting

There is no purpose scouting. You are going to do the same build no matter what, and it only wastes mining time to pull an SCV from the mineral line.

Transitions

There are no transitions from this all-in. Keep rallying Marines and your next Thor and all of your SCVs and hope it is enough to win the game.

Tips

- When your Medivac pops, load up your Thor and drop your opponent, trying to kill production or SCVs.
- Avoid fighting your opponents army with your initial Thor drop at all costs. Only engage your opponents army directly once your Marines and SCVs are in the fight as well.
- Make sure to pull around 10 SCVs and attack with all of your Marines when you start your 2nd Thor so that your 2 Thors, 12 Marines, and 10 SCVs all get to your opponents base at the same time.
- During the fight, surround your Thor(s) with SCVs and repair.
- Use your Marines for a bit of extra DPS as they sit behind your Thor(s), but the true power of this all-in comes from the fact that Thors being repaired take close to no damage from early game Terran units.

Pros and Cons

This build rolls over most 1rax FE builds. Also, its a hilarious all-in that straight up kills unprepared opponents or opponents who dont have good repair micro. Also, a huge pro is that this build IS A THOR DROP.

However, this build is very weak against Reapers because you only have 2 Marines to defend against Reapers in the early game. That being said, if you can ward off the Reapers without losing too many SCVs, you might still win because Thors are obviously strong against Reapers in direct fights.  This build is also very bad against Banshees, but its possible to win the base trade because Thors also destroy Banshees in an actual fight.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Factory,CallMule,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Armory,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,Starport,SCV,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,Thor,Medivac,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Thor,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:30:04 PM;

This safe fast expand build opens with a 1gate FE and then transitions into Colossi and double upgrades as fast as possible in order to go into the late game with an upgrade and tech advantage over a Terran opponent.

Benchmark: @100% +1/+1 (@10:30ish), you should have around 55 Probes, 1 Sentry, and 2 Colossi.

Scouting

This is a very safe macro build, getting you enough units in the early game for scouting or defensive purposes, so Probe scouting is usually unnecessary.  If your opponent sends a Reaper at your base, then be defensive with your initial Zealot/Stalker, and use only your Mothership Core to scout around.  If your opponent does NOT send a Reaper at your base, then poke out with your initial Zealot/Stalker and later Mothership Core to poke at your opponents front and glean some information about their build.

While your early game is completely safe, therefore making Probe scouting irrelevant, the early midgame is not, and thus scouting is crucial. If you know that your opponent is going for a Widow Mine drop, then get out Observers and several more Stalkers and place them defensively in each mineral line. Be prepared to use the Mothership Cores Photon Overcharge on whichever Nexus your opponent chooses to drop. Delay Colossus tech in order to favor more units to deal with the harass. This same reaction works against all early drop-based or Banshee play. Against any early frontal assaults, simply Planetary Nexus your natural expansion and warp-in several more units.

Transitions

This build is quite macro-oriented, so playing for the long-game is crucial.  Against standard Bio play, Bio/Mine play, or Bio/Hellbat play, take your third base after your 3rd Colossus and transition into Chargelots, Archons, and Storm. Add more Gateways as your minerals permit. Also, Blink is a good upgrade to prioritize against heavy drop play on maps with a large distance between your main and third bases.

Against Mech play, take your third base and begin heavy Immortal production.  Make Immortals, Archons, and High Templar while on 3 bases, and focus on hitting a +3/+3 timing attack before your opponent is maxed.  Add more Robotics Facilities as your gas permits.

Pros and Cons

This build stays safe against early shenanigans as you macro up and tech straight for Colossus and +1/+1. It also gives you the infrastructure necessary to defend early drops or harassment common in this matchup.  With your upgrade lead and tech advantage, you can safely transition into the lategame by safely taking another base and going for Storm.

Tips

- Chronoboost your initial Nexus to get out as many probes as early as possible to kick start your economy.
- Use your initial units defensively if you spot a Reaper, or aggressively to scout your opponents base if no Reaper appears at your door by the time your Stalker has popped.
- Send your first Observer directly to your opponents base in order to see if hes opening with fast Widow Mines/harassing units, or teching up to a normal Bio timing. Only warp-in units before you get your first Colossus out if you scout your opponent playing aggressively. Delay your Colossus tech and production if you spot your opponent going for a quick drop or early attack play. Instead, focus on making Gateway units and Observers and placing them defensively to maintain your economic advantage. However, if your opponent is NOT attacking early, always prioritize economy and teching up over making Gateway units
- Never underestimate the power of making your Nexus a Planetary Nexus.  At the very least, it is a way to scare off a drop from doing economic damage if your army is out of position.
- Against early drops, target firing the Medivac with your Stalkers and Planetary Nexus can mean the difference between letting your opponent escape and crushing a poorly planned drop.
- Dont forget to use your Mothership Cores Time Warp spell against any 2 base Bio timings in order to keep your Colossus safe.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Zealot,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,Chronoboost,WarpgateUpgrade,Probe,Probe,Probe,Nexus,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Pylon,Probe,RoboticsFacility,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Observer,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Observer,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,RoboticsBay,Probe,Chronoboost,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Forge,Forge,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,GroundWeaponsLevel1,GroundArmorLevel1,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,ExtendedThermalLance,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,TwilightCouncil,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:30:04 PM;

Push out when your 3rd Archon finishes (@11:00ish) with 3 Sentries, 3 Archons, 1 Stalker, and around 12 Zealots, with +2/+2 about to finish.

Scouting

In the early game, Probe scout after your Gateway in order to spot whether your opponent is opening with a Reaper or Widow Mine drop. Against Reaper play you have to position your initial few units very defensively in order to avoid losing any Probes. Against a Widow Mine drop, be sure to build those Photon Cannons in your mineral lines as soon as your Forges finish. After the early game, scouting is much more minimal than you might expect. As long as you can confirm your opponent is not 1 base all-inning you (Hallucinations can give you a lot of information), you can perform this build.

Transitions

This build is a strong two base timing attack, so be sure to commit all your energy into non-stop warping in from a proxy Pylon in order to bust through your opponents front. In most situations, you will simply be able to walk through your opponents front and win the game.

However, if your opponent has a strong defense at his natural (Supply Depots and multiple Bunkers), you do already have plenty of Probes back at home, so you can simply start a 3rd Nexus, resume Probe Production, continue upgrades by getting +3/+3, and transition into Storm play. If you are going for this macro play, then be sure to get out several Colossus before you max out for a stronger 200 supply army.

Tips

- You are only able to afford so many units because of how many Probes you have. Be sure to Chronoboost your Nexii as often as possible in the early game to get up a strong 2 base economy.
- The limiting factor in this build is the Forge upgrades.  After the early game, Chronoboost your Forges as often as you can so that your 11 minute attack hits with +2/+2.
- Hallucinate Phoenix to get scouting information on your opponents opening build order.
- Against Reaper play, position your initial units defensively.
- Against Widow Mine play, be sure to get out those Photon Cannons in each mineral line on time. Using your Photon Overcharge and target firing an early Medivac can be a game changer in defending early pressure.
- Set up multiple proxy Pylons before you are ready to move out so that even if your opponent kills one or two of them, you will be able to reinforce your attack.
- During the attack, be sure that your army does not waste time attacking buildings.  Focus fire and reposition your army so that everything is always fighting your opponents army.
- If your opponent has a solid wall at his natural, then do not commit to a doomed attack. Simply playing the macro game with your upgrade advantage is a much stronger option.

Pros and Cons

This is a strong attack that destroys Bio players who do not have good building placement or who are playing too greedy. Also, your strong attack has +2/+2 and 60 Probes  so even if it fails, you have a strong economy and upgrade lead going into the late game.

This build is not great against early Widow Mine drops because your only detection is the Photon Cannons in your mineral lines.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Sage Blink All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with some light Stalker pressure and then follows up with a 3gate Blink Stalker all-in, using the Mothership Core for high ground vision and Time Warp.

Blink into the main when Blink finishes (@7:40ish) with 12 Stalkers and 25 Probes at home.

Scouting

This build is an aggressive opener that makes a lot of units, so you will not have to worry about Probe scouting. Against Reaper play, keep your first Stalker on a common hop-up ledge in order to deny your opponent scouting the Twilight Council. Against other defensive play, poke out to your opponents front with your first Stalker and check to see whether your opponent is going for Widow Mines or a quick CC into Bio so you know how to micro when you Blink into his main base with all of your units.

Transitions

This build is an all-in, so there is no standard follow-up. If your attack does damage and you keep most of your units alive, then you can take a natural expansion and transition into Upgrades+Storm. However, if you do not do significant damage with your initial Stalkers and also lose them, you are most likely out of the game because your midgame tech and economy will be vastly behind that of your opponent.

Tips

- Do not bother Probe scouting, you can do this build against nearly everything your opponent chooses to open with.
- With your initial Stalkers, either protect your main base from a Reaper scouting your Twilight Council or move out and poke up at your opponents base for some early scouting intel.
- The limiting factor with this build is Blink Researchs build time, so be sure to Chronoboost that Research constantly in order to attack as soon as possible.
- Keep your Mothership Core out of harms way. Use its 14 sight range for high ground vision, but do not commit the Mothership Core in the attack because without high ground vision, your attack will most likely fail.
- Do not forget to use your Mothership Cores Time Warp ability to help pick off SCVs or Bio units that are out of position.
- Do NOT over-commit your Stalkers in a risky blink. Only aggressively blink to get up to a high ground or to pick off a Siege Tank/Widow Mine before it activates.
- Constantly warping-in more Stalkers to reinforce your army and add strength to the attack is key to crushing through your opponents defenses.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong build because of how quickly you get both high ground vision with your Mothership Core and enough Blink Stalkers to do real damage.

However, this build is in fact an all-in, so there is no standard transition should the attack fail. Also, if your Stalker positioning is sub-optimal, a Reaper may scout your Twilight Council and reveal the build before you have even moved out to attack.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Stalker,TwilightCouncil,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Stalker,Blink,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,MothershipCore,Pylon,Gateway,Gateway,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:30:37 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'SaSe DT Rush', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This DT rush opens with a 3 Stalker Rush for safety and map control, and then gets out fast DTs either for offense (taking advantage of your opponent?s possible lack of detection early on) or defense (applying pressure while you safely take an expansion of your own).

Scouting

This build is a pretty unsafe build in general, only giving you 3-5 units for the early game timings, thus scouting is huge. However, because this build was created by SaSe, you are also low on minerals for quite some time and thus cannot afford losing mining time by scouting with a Probe.  Therefore, in the early game merely scout in your base for a proxy Gateway with the Probe who builds the 2nd Pylon; the rest of your scouting will come from your 3 Stalkers. Being active with these 3 Stalkers around your natural, third, and watchtower will prevent your opponent from sneaking proxy Pylons past you and hitting you with a very early Gateway attack. Thus, you will be able to see an incoming push coming before it?s too late, and can delay/cancel your fast expand in favor of more units if you need to.

Transitions

This build transitions very smoothly into Chargelot/Archon builds or Blink Stalker builds. To make either transition, first resume chronoboosting out probes from both Nexi and then start your research of choice (Charge or Blink). Adding on 2 more Gateways, and applying midgame pressure with lots of Gateways and 1 or 2 Archons is a great way to force units out of your opponent, scout what midgame tech he?s going, and possibly end the game if your DTs did too much damage.

Pros and Cons

This build is great because it gets a reasonably timed expansion, gives you DTs early for map control and potential game-ending damage, and lets you transition into an aggressive midgame with either Chargelots or Blink Stalkers at the core of your army composition.
However, this build is very weak vs Oracle openers, for they give both detection and a great way to harass your naked mineral line. Also, against early attacks that hit before your Dark Shrine finishes, if you miss the proxy Pylon because you are not active enough with your first three stalkers, you can straight up lose the game.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Reaper FE into 3 Rax Stim Timing', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE transitions into a very quick 2 base Stim timing with Combat Shields. With such a fast attack, you can set the pace of the game instead of letting Protoss dictate when you attack.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they get an expansion (or note if they do not expand by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Extra Bunkers and/or an Engineering Bay for defense may be a smart investment. However, if you can hold until Stimpack and Combat Shields finish (@8:50ish  much earlier than most other builds), then you will be in a great position to counter attack your opponent and do crippling damage.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and a large Bio army.  Before you focus on your attack, be sure to start a Factory for a standard Reactored Medivac follow-up. After the attack, get a 3rd Command Center, 2 more Barracks (for a total of 5), 2 Engineering Bays, and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to head into a strong, late game army.

Note that you can switch the order of the 4th and 5th Barracks with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost and the scary late game Protoss army, most Terrans have been getting their infrastructure up early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having extra reinforcements.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important; if you keep all of your SCVs in gas, then you will not have the minerals to get your Command Center or extra Barracks at the correct time.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add up to 2 Bunkers at the front, and start that Marauder production as soon as possible.
- Oracles massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you should consider skipping Marauders for more Marines or even start an emergency Engineering Bay for one turret per mineral line. Note that even if your opponent does early game damage with an Oracle, your 9 minute attack can still end the game if your opponents follow-up is not executed precisely.
- Be sure to move out with your army BEFORE Stimpack and Combat Shields finish. You want to be attacking your opponents natural expansion as soon as those two upgrades finish.
- If your opponent is out of position, you can kill their entire army or snipe their natural expansion. However, be sure that you focus fire one or the other down  losing too much DPS by having your units attack both the Nexus and the army is the main way to screw up the attack.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because of how many units you can get out for a pre-10 minute attack. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Therefore, this build is a much more aggressive variant of the other Reaper expands possible in TvP.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that with such a low Marine count in the early game, fast Oracles can do a lot of damage if your scouting is not perfect.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,GoOutScv,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Barracks,SCV,DoubleMarines,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,DoubleMarines,OrbitalCommand,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,DoubleMarines,StimPack,Marine,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,CombatShield,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,Factory,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marauder,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,Starport,Refinery,ReactorOnFactory,EngineeringBay,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,CallMule,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,InfantryWeaponsLevel1', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:30:37 PM;

This Reaper FE gets out a fast Factory so that you can defend any early Protoss pressure with Widow Mines and Bunkers. It then transitions into standard Bio play for a 10 minute Medivac attack.

Scouting

The very beginning of this build is somewhat fragile (opening with a Reaper FE means that you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper.  Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they expand (or note if they do not get a fast expansion by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play as you sacrifice your Reaper into your opponents base. If you are playing against a 1 basing Protoss, then constantly produce Widow Mines  do not just stop at 1. Also, if you do not know whether or not your opponent has built a Stargate, building a Bunker in your main mineral line for 4 Marines to sit in and shoot any early game Oracles is not a bad idea too.

Push out when your first set of Medivacs finish (@10:10ish) with 3 Medivacs, around 6 Marauders and 26 Marines, and 53 SCVs at home

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and Medivacs. After this build, get Concussive Shells, take a 3rd Command Center, continue your upgrades by getting and Armory and another Engineering Bay, build 2 more Barracks, and react to whatever midgame splash damage your opponent is getting. Against Colossi, get a 2nd Starport; against Storm, get a Ghost Academy.

Tips

- If you are not comfortable with pulling SCVs in and out of gas, then simply ignore the two notes telling you to pull an SCV out of and then later put one more into gas (at 15 and 22 supply).
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper.  Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), then continue making Widow Mines.  Also, consider moving your natural to your main base and defending on one base.
- Oracles massacre un-upgraded Marines, so position your Widow Mines effectively.  Also consider adding a Bunker in your mineral line if your opponent has a Stargate to further defend Oracle pressure.
- If your opponent is not playing aggressively, then drop your Widow Mine(s) and Marines at your opponents base.  Do not over commit if your opponent already has a detection/Cannons ready for you.
- This build gives you enough gas to start Marauder production much earlier than most other builds.  Be sure to ramp up your Marauder production early in order to make a beefier army than your opponent.
- Move out as soon as your Medivacs pop.  Stimpack, while not yet done, should finish by the time you get to your opponents base.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because it gives you the economy and infrastructure on par with a Wings of Liberty style 1rax FE. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Not to mention the fact that you start Widow Mine production very early in order to stay safe against any potential Protoss aggression.

However, this build is somewhat vulnerable to early Protoss pokes, especially if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that you start Stimpack a little later than other builds that go directly for Stimpack research, but you will still have Stimpack done for the 10 minute Medivac timing.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Bunker,SCV,DoubleMarines,GasScv,Factory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,Starport,WidowMine,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Medivac,CallMule,DoubleMarines,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Refinery,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnStarport,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,EngineeringBay,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,ScannerSweep,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,LiftStarportFromTechLab,LandRaxOnTechLab,LandRaxOnTechLab,StimPack,CombatShield,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnStarport,CallMule,SupplyDepot,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMedivacs,Marauder,CallMule,DoubleMarines,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Marauder,DoubleMarines,Marauder', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:30:37 PM;

The versatility of this build sets it apart from the other TvP openers: Polts build lets you defend, attack, or play off any shenanigans your opponent may through at you.

This build has a fragile beginning (you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they get an expansion (or note if they do not expand by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Extra Bunkers and/or an Engineering Bay for defense may be a smart investment.

If your opponent is going for a 2 Base Blink Stalker attack, then slow down your tech and gas income in favor of more units and more Bunkers. Start 2 Bunkers at the front and be ready to repair them with SCVs while you buy time for Combat Shields, more Marauders, and eventual Medivacs to pop.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and a large Bio army.  As you are taking map control with your initial Medivacs, be sure to add a 3rd Command Center, 2 more Barracks, and finish getting Concussive Shells and Combat Shields. Add on another Engineering Bay and an Armory to continue your upgrades as soon as you can afford it.

Note that you can switch the order of the 4th and 5th Barracks with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost and the scary late game Protoss army, most Terrans have been getting their infrastructure up early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having extra reinforcements.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important; if you keep all of your SCVs in gas, then you will not have the minerals to get your Command Center or extra Barracks at the correct time.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper.  Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add up to 2 Bunkers at the front, and start that Marauder production as soon as possible.
- Oracles massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you should consider skipping Marauders for more Marines or even start an emergency Engineering Bay for one turret per mineral line.
- Polt sometimes goes for an optional poke with his initial Marauder and several Marines if he has confirmed his opponent is not going for a Stargate. Be sure to keep these units alive  their only purpose is to take up a central XelNaga Watch tower
- When transitioning into the midgame, setting up your infrastructure while being aggressive with your first few Medivacs can outright win you the game.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because of the versatility inherent in its play. It makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game, gets up enough infrastructure to deal with all early and midgame attacks such as Oracle all-ins or Blink Stalker Timings, and then transitions into a completely standard bio midgame. It truly is an effective build to learn if you want to play safe and standard in TvP.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that it requires good scouting in order to take advantage of the versatility inherent in the build.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GoOutScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,MineralScv,CallMule,SCV,CommandCenter,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,Marine,StimPack,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,DoubleMarines,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,Factory,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,ScannerSweep,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,CallMule,Refinery,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,EngineeringBay,Marine,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,DoubleMarines,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,CombatShield,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,SCV,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMedivacs,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,ConcussiveShells,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:30:37 PM;

This build opens with the fastest possible Dark Templar in order to keep your opponent pinned in their base as well as some light harass, while you safely transition into a 2 base economy and either a Robotics or Blink focused play.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker back to the protection of your Mothership Core quickly if you have to defend an early attack. Hold on with Photon Overcharge until you can warp-in a DT to defend as well as harass.

This build is surprisingly safe against most openings, so scouting is pretty minimal.

Against standard Robo expand builds, your Nexus will be a little bit later.  You can make up for this either by using Warp Prism/DT harass or doing a Blink follow up to abuse their low production capability.

Against Blink play, simply take advantage of their lack of detection and kill a bunch of Probes. Against Dark Templar play, use your Observer and Stalker to push back their DTs while your(s) kill a bunch of Probes.

Against Stargate play, you might run into some problems. Phoenix will be able to scout what you are doing, and Oracles provide detection as well as harass potential.

Transitions

This build sets you up with a 2 base economy and both a Robotics Facility and Twilight Council. This lets you transition into either midgame Blink timings or Chargelot/Archon/Immortal macro play very easily.

To transition into Blink play, start and chronoboost Blink from your Twilight Council as soon as your first Dark Templar is warped in. Go up to 5 Gateways on 2 Assimilators and warp-in Blink Stalkers non-stop at your opponents base in order to punish typically greedy play in reaction to DT expand builds.

To transition into Chargelot/Archon/Immortal play, start Immortal production, a Forge, and go up to 3 Gateways. Once you are safely in the midgame, start Charge and be sure to out-expand your opponent.

Tips

- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial Stalker to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Traps 3gate All-in).
- You may want to proxy 2 Pylons with this build. One for the initial hidden Dark Shrine. The second for a close warp-in location for your initial DT.
- Un-chronoboosted Warpgate will time out perfectly with your Dark Shrine finishing
- Against Stargate play, be sure to position your initial units to defend your mineral line from potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- In the midgame, spend all of your Chronoboost on either the Robotics Facility or Twilight Councildepending on your transition.

Pros and Cons

This build is a reasonably safe build that allows you harass potential as well as forces your opponent to stay at home. It also expands at a normal time in order to get to the midgame quickly and transition smoothly into either a fast timing or macro play.

However, this build is somewhat weak against early Stargate play, for the Stargate allows for Oracles to both harass and detect and Phoenix to take map control.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,WarpgateUpgrade,MothershipCore,TwilightCouncil,Probe,Pylon,Probe,DarkShrine,Probe,Pylon,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Nexus,Probe,Observer,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,WarpInDarkTemplar', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:30:38 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Scarlett Macro Mutalisk Style', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

The definitive macro build of modern ZvT, Scarlett?s fast 3 Hatch style quickly transitions into the most commonly used composition of Zergling, Baneling, Mutalisk. Utilizing a gasless opener with a high Queen count and fast upgrades, this is by far the best build with which to learn ZvT.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of very early force, make a few Zerglings to stay safe. However, do NOT overproduce early game units because this will slow down your 3 base saturation, and thus your midgame strength. Your next scout will be with an Overlord just after you start your +1/+1 (@7:15ish). This is merely to scout whether your opponent is opening with 3 base Bio play, 3 base Mech play, or a 2 base timing. If your opponent is going Mech, immediately abandon this build. Zerglings and Banelings are highly ineffective against Hellbats, Hellions, and Siege Tanks, so begin violently tech switching based off of Terran?s composition; Mutalisks for Tanks, Swarm Hosts for Hellbat Thor, etc. Continuing Mutalisk production is fine, but be sure to take a much earlier 5th base and Infestation Pit, as well as a Roach Warren. If your opponent is opening bio, proceed as the build dictates.

Transitions

As soon as you confirm that your opponent is going for a 3rd Command Center, feel free to start your 4th Hatchery. Against Mech play, transitioning into Swarm Hosts, Mutalisks, or Vipers is very strong. Against Bio/Mine play, transitioning into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk or mass Zergling/Baneling is also quite strong. Assuming you have not scouted Mech, your transition into standard Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk should serve you fine against any bio based composition. Emphasize Zerglings against Bio/Mine, Banelings against Bio/Hellbat, and Mutalisks against Marine/Tank.

Tips

- Be sure that you take map control with your initial Zerglings. Being able to spot when and with what your opponent moves out on the map can be crucial in defending any early timings.
- Metabolic Boost will not finish until just before 8 minutes with this build. If your opponent is hitting you very early, then a Spine Crawler and/or extra Queens will be more useful than slow Zerglings.
- As above, beware Reapers pressuring the Drone that attempts to take your 3rd base. You will have to defend it cautiously with Queens and your slower Zerglings. This is where creep spread will greatly assist you.
- Just after you start your +1/+1 upgrades, be sure to send a sacrificial Overlord into your opponent?s base to check whether your opponent is going for a Mech or Bio build.
- Against a Banshee based opener, over-produce Queens and conserve energy for Transfuses, without compromising either your creep spread or your injects too much.
- Be aware of the flow of each Terran composition. For example, Bio/Mine typically means non stop aggression, so usage of static defense to buy time and Mutalisks to intercept reinforcements is critical.
- Mutalisks are prioritized in this build over the other two components; Zerglings and Banelings. It is important to be as active with them as possible without compromising your macro.
- Against Bio/Mine, engage in small groups whenever possible to abuse the long cooldown of Widow Mines to the maximum effect.
- Against Bio/Hellbat/Thor, be sure to emphasize a ground army instead of a Mutalisk based composition. More Banelings and a faster hive are highly recommended, and be sure to fight on creep to get the best possible Baneling connections.
- Be aware of the standard creep clearing push that every bio Terran executes between 10 to 12 minutes, using their first two Medivacs, 15 to 25 Marines with Combat Shield/Stimpack, and the survivors of the Reaper/Hellion squad; be sure to have Banelings ready to defend, and surrender non essential creep tumors (any tumors placed upon paths he will not attack on).
- Using the Mutalisks to deny the fourth base as long as possible is critical to victory. Because you have made so many Mutalisks, your own Hive Tech will be delayed, so you must delay Terran as long as possible in turn.
- The build gets looser and more flexible as the game goes on, as is to be expected. As you are first trying out this build, you will either be far too greedy, and die with too many Drones, or far too safe, and die with not enough Drones. Constantly adjust the ratio of Drones to units based upon what you scout and the flow of the game, and learn the precise moments when you are completely free to Drone, and when you are not to maximize your success with this build.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong against almost all standard Terran openers. It gets 4 Queens for safety, injects, creep spread, and to defend a very quick 3rd Hatchery. With such a fast third, your midgame economy is also quite solid. This build is also currently viewed as the best way to play macro ZvT. It has no inherent weaknesses, and thus will always guarantee that the better player wins the game.
However, because you delay your Extractors in favor of 4 Queens, this build is not as safe against 1 Base all-ins than an opener that gets a very fast Metabolic Boost. Additionally, because you are opening gasless, Reaper openers have to be defended purely with Queens and your Terran opponent may be more inclined to play much greedier than he normally would against a gas opener.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Queen,InjectLarva,Queen,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Hatchery,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Overlord,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,EvolutionChamber,EvolutionChamber,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,MeleeAttacksLevel1,GroundCarapaceLevel1,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Lair,SpawnCreepTumor,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,BanelingNest,Drone,Hatchery,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Spire,PneumatizedCarapace,Hatchery,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,CentrifugalHooks,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,MeleeAtacksLevel2,GroundCarapaceLevel2,Overseer,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,FlyerCarapaceLevel1,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:30:38 PM;

This aggressive build used by Liquid`TaeJa and many other top level Korean Terrans opens with a very standard Banshee build adapted to Heart of the Swarm and the cheaper Banshee Cloak upgrade. The Banshees are used to stay safe against early attacks as well as harass your opponent.

This build is VERY closely related to Polts Gas First Banshee Build  TaeJas version is just a Barracks first variant of Polts build.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your 1st Refinery to check whether or not your opponent is opening with Reapers. Against an opponent opening Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe; thus, you should try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or expanded at your natural with your first few Marines.

Your next scout will come with your Banshee. With this Banshee, you can check what your opponents opener is. Against another Banshee player, follow-up your first Banshee with a Raven (and then potentially Viking if extra anti-air is needed). Against a Hellbat dropping player, make a few Widow Mines to burrow defensively against any incoming drop, as you use several Banshees to out-harass him. Against a player going for a Widow Mine Drop, position your Marines defensively at home and be sure to have enough scans to deal with his Widow Mines. Building a Raven might be useful, but not until after you have 2 Banshees with which to harass your opponent.

Finally, be sure to keep an eye out on what midgame transition your opponent is doing. Look for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either all-in, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play quite easily.

For an all-in transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory and start Siege Tank production instantly. When you hit 2 or 3 Siege Tanks, grab all of your Marines (>20), your Banshees/Vikings, and attempt to break your opponents front with a slow siege push.

It is possible to go into Marine/Tank or Mech after a 3 Command Center follow-up if you are sure your opponent will not be going for any more early game pressure. Start a Raven in order to save enough minerals to afford 2 Command Centers and then transition into either Marine/Tank or Mech just as below.

When transitioning into macro Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production after you start a 2nd Command Center. That way you have enough defense early and later can have a strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy Siege Tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use.
- Watch for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop your Banshee as you enter your opponents base.  Cloak your Banshee as soon as you see any potential for burrowed Widow Mines.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that are undefended by a Turret.  If you are transitioning to a 1/1/1 all-in, then be sure to target-fire Marines as well.
- Always favor keeping your Banshee(s) alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two. You can also repair a weakened Banshee at home with SCVs if you can keep it alive.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural. You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This build is a standard, aggressive opener in TvT that both scouts and stays safe in the early game. Also, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for you are able to transition into an all-in, 3 Command Center play, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play. Also, this build requires a lot less APM than other TvT builds, so it can be very useful for lower league players.

However, this build is not quite as effective at killing workers as a Widow Mine Drop into Banshee build. Also, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind your opponent in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades, especially if they open with a fast expansion. Finally, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,Factory,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Refinery,SCV,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Starport,ReactorOnBarracks,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,CallMule,SCV,LandStarportOnTechLab,CloakingField,DoubleMarines,Banshee,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:30:38 PM;

Though it has fallen out of popularity, this once dominant build still remains as powerful as ever. Utilizing a gas first opening to stay safe against an opponents gas first aggression, this build gets a fast two Medivacs to violently drop 8 Marines, 2 Siege Tanks, and 3 Auto Turrets in a critical position of the enemys base.

Scouting

Taeja chooses only to scout with his Hellion, preserving all his SCVs for maximum income. At times, he cannot afford continuous Marine or SCV production in the demonstration replay; had he SCV scouted he would be even more pushed for minerals.

SCV scouting is definitely an option if you do not feel safe enough with the delayed hellion scout, but it should be relegated to a 4:30 scout at the very earliest so as to not delay your Starport in any way.

Transitions

This build can transition into both Bio or Mech. Because you have made no major investments down either tech path, and you have exactly one of each necessary production structure, you can literally go into whatever style you want.

Tips

Against a live resisting opponent, execution of this build may run into some problems. They could be opening banshees; forcing Turrets to be made just before you move out. They could be doing the exact same build, resulting in a base trade. They could be doing earlier aggression that pins you in your base for longer than youd like, such as an elevator attack or a doom drop.

There are reactions to each of these plays, and there are far too many to list here. Regardless of what happens though, sometimes it is important to identify that you are more ahead simply by staying home and defending, and not to blindly commit to the attack every single game. This will come by experience and repeatedly executing the build.

Three main consistencies must be maintained;

1) You MUST continue unit production behind this attack; you cannot start a big transition (adding on Barracks/Factories while freezing production by constructing addons) else you will be extremely vulnerable to a counter attack. The only exception is when you know with certainty that your opponent will not be performing some sort of counterattack (for example, he has gone 3 Barracks into delayed Factory, or he has gone for a elevator and youve already killed the medivacs beforehand).

2) Once your autoturrets are dropped, its almost always a good idea to fly the Raven home; it will prove useful in the mid game.

3) If they made Banshees, you have to make turrets before moving out, else risk losing the game. Delay this to the last possible moment, as you are already pressed for cash.

Pros and Cons

The lethality of this build cannot be understated; you can simply win most games with this drop, especially against players who have gone for more macro oriented builds, such as a Reaper FE or a 15 gas style.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Speedling All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Speedling all-in is a cheese designed to hard and blind-counter a Gateway Expanding Protoss player in the current metagame. It also has varying success against a FFE, depending on your opponent?s building placement.

Scouting

You only need to Drone scout for the Protoss on a 4 player map such as Whirlwind or Red City. Your early Spawning Pool prevents you from having the minerals to scout with a Drone on any other map. Instead of scouting with your units, the vast majority of your scouting will come from your initial Overlords? vision. Also, you do not need to scout for any Protoss cheeses because cheese should counter any of their cheeses quite effectively.

Transitions

Because this build is straight-up cheese, there is no true transition to this build. However, if you do damage and want to continue into a macro game, take a natural Hatchery and start a 2nd Queen to play a 2base, map control play style.

Tips

- Position your Overlords to give you vision of your opponent?s walls. Attacking the holes in your opponent?s building placement is crucial with this build, but that can only be easily done once you have vision of these holes.
- Use your initial 6 Zerglings to do as much damage as possible, along with scouting the Protoss for unusual play.
Avoid placing your Zerglings in a position where they can be surrounded by Probes and/or Zealots. Always retreat and poke in another area instead of committing to a bad position to get a guaranteed kill on a single target.
- Avoid a-clicking with your Zerglings. Rather, pick a target, move behind it to surround it, and then attack-move or target-fire the individual unit for a quick kill.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any Protoss player going for a Gateway Expand (the current metagame).  It is designed to do potentially game-winning damage against any player with sub-optimal building placement and Probe control.
However, it is significantly weaker against a Forge Fast Expanding player, for your Zerglings can only do damage where there are no Photon Cannons or wall-offs.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Extractor,Drone,Overlord,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn5Seconds,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MetabolicBoost,Queen,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:30:38 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'TLO 2 Base Muta', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with an economic 2 base Muta opener, and uses a 7:20 Overlord scout coupled with the initial Mutalisk harass to determine whether your Terran opponent is using a Bio-based composition, or a Mech-based composition.

Scouting

Scout first with your 2 initial Zerglings, use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of the Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of force very early, you will probably need emergency Spine Crawlers ? your Metabolic Boost will only be finishing around 8:20!
Your next scout will be with an Overlord as soon as your Lair finishes (around 7:05).  With this scout, aim to check if your opponent is playing Mech or Bio. Seeing any of the following can indicate Mech play: an Armory, more than 1 Factory, a Factory with Tech Lab, a lack of Barracks, or a lack of add-ons on Barracks. Seeing any of the following can indicate Bio play: 2 Engineering Bays, a Barracks with a researching Tech lab, more than 1 Barracks, or only one Factory.  If you scout Bio, you can still continue with a 2 base Spire timing and transition into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk OR you can abort the 2 base Spire timing and throw down 2 Evolution Chambers as soon as possible for +1/+1 Melee/Carapace upgrades.
The next scout will be with your initial Mutalisks. Terran will be forced to defend himself with his units, so you?ll see either Bio or Mech units to defend. These Mutalisks should be able to get into his main quite easily and scout what type of production he is using, perhaps even doing some economic damage.

Transitions

If you confirm Mech play with your Mutalisks, throw down an Infestation Pit. If you are sure he is going Mech before your Mutalisks arrive, then you can even place the Infestation Pit as soon as your Mutalisks hatch. Add more bases and Swarm Hosts when you can afford them.  Swarm Hosts are a strong option as your initial Mutalisks will likely force Turrets, Thors, and Widow Mines?units that are generally not strong against Swarm Host play. Alternatively, you can go into Overlord Speed and drop-play, to abuse the lack of Terran mobility. Finally, you can also place your Hive as soon as possible and go for a follow-up Brood Lord transition.
If you confirm Bio play with your Mutalisks, throw down 2 Evolution Chambers and a Baneling Nest as soon as possible. Note that you will be behind in upgrades against a 3 base macro Terran player, but you can recuperate this loss by aiming to snipe a key Tech lab researching Stimpack or Combat Shields, as this can prevent Terran from being aggressive with his upgrade lead. Good creep spread and strong engagements/burrowed Banelings can also mitigate this upgrade deficit. Once you hit the lategame, you have the option to transition into your preferred Hive tech.

Tips

- If you place a 5:00-5:30 Spine Crawler, you should be able to stop Hellions made from a Factory started before your opponent?s 2nd base. A 6:00-6:30 Spine Crawler will finish in time to stop Hellions made after your opponent?s 2nd base or Hellions made after a Reaper opener.
- Just when your Lair finishes (7:20ish), ideally you should be fully saturated on your 2 bases with extra minerals going into additional Drones. However, there are a couple of defensive options available if you are under pressure: If you have extra Drones and want to completely deter Hellion runbys, then make a wall-off with 2 Evolution Chambers and your Spine Crawler at the front of your natural.This will not slow down your Mutalisk timing as long as you remain fully saturated on all mineral lines and Extractors. Alternatively, you also have the ability to make a large group of Zerglings (only if you need to defend yourself) without hurting the timing of the Mutalisks. Note that you should only do this if you absolutely have to because droning should always be a priority. Remember that Metabolic Boost will only finish around 8:20, so any Zerglings made before this point should be used strictly for defense.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against Mech players. The initial Mutalisks will force extra Missile Turrets, Thors, and Widow Mines ? units that are all not ideal against the large mass of Swarm Hosts that you should follow-up with.
If you scout your opponent opening Bio with your Mutalisk timing, then you can transition into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk. The obvious problem here is that you will be behind on upgrades, but again this is not game-ending provided you get strong, cost-efficient engagements on creep. Also, this build is vulnerable to large Marine attacks in the early-game because you will not have Metabolic Boost yet to defend them. Hopefully, however, you can scout this coming with your initial Zerglings and/or Overlord in order to stay safe with Spine Crawlers.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Queen,Overlord,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Lair,Extractor,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,MetabolicBoost,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Spire,Overlord,Overlord,Hatchery,Queen,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,SpawnCreepTumor,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:30:38 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Trap 3gate All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This hyper-aggressive 3gate all-in opens with a Gateway on 10 supply in order to get the fastest Warpgate Research possible. It then hits a ridiculously early (@5:30ish) 3gate attack in order to end the game before leaving the early game.

Scouting

This build requires very minimal scouting, for you are placing your initial Gateway at 10 supply?long before any scouting information could influence your build. However, it is critical to send a Probe out to set up proxy Pylon(s) BEFORE your Warpgate is done. Thus, probe scouting to check whether your opponent has opened with a 3 Stalker Rush in order to deny proxy Pylons can yield useful information.

Transitions

This build is an all-in in every respect: getting a 10 Gateway, non-stop chronoboosting Warpgate, halting Probe production at 16 (on minerals), and dumping all money into Gateway units. Thus, there is no well-defined transition. If you are late in your execution and do not outright kill your opponent (or at least take out their army and 10+ Probes), then you will most likely lose the game to any sort of Robotics/Twilight/Stargate counter-attack.

Tips

- Use only 1 Chronoboost on Probes (as you resume Probe production after your 10 Gateway).
- Use 1 Chronoboost on your Zealot in order to finish it as your Cybernetics Core finishes.
- ALL THE REST OF YOUR CHRONOBOOST MUST BE DUMPED INTO WARPGATE RESEARCH. The limiting factor on this build is how fast you can finish Warpgate. Be sure to non-stop chronoboost your Cybernetics Core until it finishes researching so as to attack as early as possible.
- There is a slightly more aggressive/less economic version of this build that opens with a 15 Zealot, 17 Pylon, and never chronoboosts the Zealot. That build and this build can be used interchangeably based on personal preference.
- Place your proxy Pylons quite aggressively for your attack to hit as fast as possible, unless you need to hide your proxy Pylon from a 3 Stalker rushing player.
- Commit to the attack as quickly as possible and never stop warping-in Zealots and Stalkers until either you have won the game or you have lost all of your units. The strength of this all-in is how quickly and ferociously it attacks, but if you are not constantly attacking then your opponent?s economic/tech advantage can destroy you.

Pros and Cons

This build is a hyper-aggressive all-in that is able to get 5 Stalkers and 1 Zealot warped-in at your opponent?s base at 5:30. Because of how quickly this build attacks, it can punish most greedy PvP builds with ease.
Unfortunately, this all-in is quite easy to scout because you cannot hide the fact that you are getting your first Gateway and Cybernetics Core much earlier than the normal timing. However, it being easy to scout and easy to defend are two fundamentally different things, so you can still win with this build quite often.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Pylon,Zealot,Chronoboost,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Stalker,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:30:38 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Twilight All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Forge Fast Expand and then utilizes everything the Twilight Council has to offer in order to all-in your opponent. This two base all-in gets +2 attack, DTs, and mass Blink Stalkers to crush your opponent before the late game.

Scouting

After any early game shenanigans are ruled out, as you have spotted your opponent?s third Hatchery going down, then there is no need for any scouting besides what you see with your two pokes.

When you move out with your first 3 units (Zealot, Stalker, and Mothership Core), go to Zerg?s third base and see if you can pick off a queen and force some units. If your opponent reveals that he has Roaches already, then instantly pull back and stay behind your wall until your next poke with the DTs.  Expect a Roach defense vs your Blink Stalkers. If your opponent only shows slow Zerglings, then know that your opponent delayed gas and most likely has a larger economy than normal. Expect a lot more units vs your Blink Stalkers. If your opponent shows Speedlings, then pull back and stay behind your wall until your next poke with the DTs. Expect a Roach/Ling or Hydra/Ling defense vs your Blink Stalkers.

When you send your DTs to each base of your opponent, be on the look out for what units he has to defend, or what tech structures he has built. Your push is just about to happen, so it is too late to react in any way, but it is nice to know what units you will be up against before you are actually fighting them head on.

Transitions

This build is an all-in, so there is no true transition out of it. Simply keep reinforcing with your +2 Blink Stalkers (chronoboost your Gateways when you can) until your opponent is forced to leave or your army gets crushed.

If you do not win, but see that your opponent has way too much Roach or Hydra or Roach/Hydra for you to defeat, consider falling back onto a 3rd Nexus, and starting double Robotics Colossi production as a desperation move.

Tips

- Spend all of your early game chronoboost on your Nexii to maximize Probe production.
- Because you are getting your +1 Attack so early, there is no need to chronoboost it very often. Prioritize Probes instead.
- Do not over commit with your first three units. The Zealot can be killed, but if at all possible, retreat with your Stalker and Mothership Core still alive.
- Hide the Twilight Council (and later Dark Shrine) somewhere in your base that is less likely to be scouted by an Overlord.
- Keep a Probe hidden somewhere on the map before you are ready to move out. Being able to place a nice proxy Pylon for the DTs and then later Stalker warp-ins can be the difference between an easy win and a tough loss.
- Obviously, during the fight itself, utilize Blink to save the weakest Stalkers and keep your army alive.

Pros and Cons

This build is a solid all-in that utilizes everything the Twilight Council has to offer. It is a 1-2-3 punch sort of build, first hitting with your initial 3 units, then the DTs, and then the Blink Stalkers, so it keeps Zergs on their toes.

However, because this build is so reliant on the Twilight Council, your opponent flying in an overlord and spotting this will tip them off to everything that you are building; it is very easy to scout (Note: just because it is easy to scout does NOT mean it is easy to defend). Also, it is an all-in, so assuming you do not succeed in crushing your opponent with the Blink Stalkers, there is very little chance you have of coming back into the game. Finally, because this build packs a 1-2-3 punch, it is a more mechanically difficult build than other choices and is not suggested for newer players.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,GoOutProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Nexus,Forge,Pylon,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Chronoboost,PhotonCanon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,GroundWeaponsLevel1,Zealot,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,MothershipCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Stalker,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,TwilightCouncil,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Blink,DarkShrine,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,GroundWeaponsLevel2,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInDarkTemplar,WarpInDarkTemplar,WarpInDarkTemplar,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:30:40 PM;

This build uses a fast +1 Carapace upgrade to secure a fast 3rd Base and deny opposing 3rds before it transitions into a swift +1/+1 Speed Roach timing and eventual +2/+1.

Scouting

In the early stages of the game, all scouting comes from Overlord vision, so be sure that you send your initial 2 Overlords towards your opponent?s natural expansion. You can use your Overlord to compare his Hatchery?s HP to yours, to determine what kind of opener he used. If his hatchery is stronger than yours, he has gone hatchery first. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is the same HP as yours, he has VERY LIKELY done the same build as you. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is weaker to yours, he has gone for a gas and pool before hatchery in some order, meaning his speed is quicker than yours. Banelings before speed in this scenario is often advised, and likely make the Baneling nest in the main to not lose your Baneling tech to mass Zerglings with speed. An alternative is to not use your Gas, and get extra Queens and 2-3 Spine Crawlers. The main theme here is to not get Speed first, as his WILL be quicker. You need to find an edge that isn?t using Zergling Speed.
When playing versus any very early aggression (<10 pool), use your Drones to defend until you have your own Zerglings, a Queen, and potentially a Spine Crawler. Consider canceling the Hatchery for more minerals. Also use your initial overlord to scout when your opponent is taking their natural Hatchery. Feel free to apply some light pressure with your first Zerglings against a Hatch first build, but do not let it mess up your macro.
Make sure you have 2 to 4 Zerglings out on the map at all times. Send your initial 2 Zerglings to your opponent?s base to spot what they have at the front, and if possible get into the main with 1 Ling to see whether your hatching Drones or Zerglings from their eggs. Use the scouting intel that these pokes give you to determine whether you should get Banelings and extra Zerglings to defend yourself or pressure your opponent, or whether you should continue droning.
If your scout Zerglings see Drones hatching, and no wall at the front, you can choose to make Drones OR Zerglings to pressure. If you scout Zerglings, and no wall at the front, you should make the same amount of Zerglings. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings escape, send them back in to scout in 20~ seconds. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings die, remake the scout. Consider another 2 Zerglings for just-in-case Banelings. If you scout a wall, the Zerg is likely playing passive and you are likely safe.
As soon as you are sure you are safe, transition into your choice of tech.

Transitions

This has best synergy with a Hydralisk transition, which is possible after taking gas numbers 5 and 6 at your third base, although you could flood earlier Speedlings with +1 Carapace. However, you have the option of simply researching +1 Melee upgrades to transition into upgraded Speedlings, which is excellent against Mutalisk openers, or even going for a delayed Spire.

Tips

If your opponent is also going for a Roach based composition, remember that Roach Battles are mostly determined by macro and concaves. The superior concave will allow a smaller force to defeat a larger one, for the most part ? this is because more Roaches can fight in a larger concave, although you can also rush forward to allow the ones in the back to attack.
Against a Mutalisk based player, be sure to scout to see how many Mutalisks your opponent is making. If he is only making a few Mutalisks to dictate the pace of the game and force spores, you will probably be able to get away with only making Queens and Spores. If your opponent is heavily committing to Mutalisks, then consider incorporating Hydralisks and Infestors earlier than you normally would, in addition to the standard Queens and Spores. Spore Crawlers should also be placed to cover your Extractors, to ensure you do not fall behind tech wise. Do not be afraid to delay your Roach Timing if you are not sure how your opponent is going to play it out.
Against an upgraded Speedling force, delay your timing until you are maxed out. If your opponent invests very heavily into melee and carapace upgrades, they are almost certainly transitioning into an Ultralisk focused composition.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very flexible opener, which can combat greedier defensive play and also more aggressive play if your defensive micro is strong.
Because you are opening +1 Carapace Speedlings, taking and defending your third should relatively straightforward. Additionally, you have the opportunity of being reactive; the infrastructure you have at Lair level (+1 Carapace, Roach Warren, Metabolic Boost) allow you to choose between +1/+1 Speedlings, +1+1 Roaches, or even a slightly delayed Mutalisk transition.
However, this build by default will skip the Baneling nest in favor of faster upgrades and Lair Tech, so it is important to be on point with your scouting to avoid dying to enemy Baneling/Speedling aggression. If your scouting is poor, consider opening instead with the Safe Ling/Bling Opener, which will teach you what to look for and give you the tools to defend with.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Overlord,Extractor,Drone,Queen,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Queen,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,EvolutionChamber,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GroundCarapaceLevel1,Hatchery,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Lair,InjectLarva,RoachWarren,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Extractor,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GlialReconstitution,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:30:40 PM;

This Reaper FE opens with a strong economy, and then transitions into constant harass with a Widow Mine drop follow-up.

Scouting

This build is reasonably safe against most your opponent can open with as long as you are smart with your two Reapers.  Use them for scouting by poking at your opponents front in order to determine what your opponent can or cannot be doing as well as potentially killing a Marine or SCV.  Against Reaper play, keep your Reapers more defensively positioned.

Transitions

This build can transition into Marine/Tank or Mech very easily. However you cannot transition into Bio/Hellbat because you have not invested any time into getting the early game Bio upgrades.

When transitioning into Marine/Tank, start your tank production soon, using the Widow Mines and Reapers to stay safe as well as apply pressure. As your Medivac is moving out, swap your Barracks onto the Factorys Reactor and start double Marine production, add on a Tech lab onto your Factory to start Siege Tank production, and build two more Barracks and a third Refinery as soon as you can afford it to complete your 2 base infrastructure.

When transitioning into Mech, again you must rely on the Widow Mines and Reapers to stay safe and apply pressure, but this time back at home you must be playing greedily. You can dump your money into a 3rd base while your Medivac is moving out. Once youve started 3 bases, getting 2 more Factories, all your Refineries, and a decent Siege Tank count is your obvious next move. YoDa likes to also make a Tech lab on his Starport to get Ravens, but this is a stylistic choice that you dont have to make.

Pros and Cons

This build is great because it gives you a good economy and gives you lots of map control with the early game Reapers/Widow Mines. The harass you can apply is incredibly effective if you split up your Widow Mines effectively throughout your opponents base.

However, it is somewhat vulnerable to Banshee play, so be sure to position your Widow Mines defensively against Banshees. Also, with poor Medivac control, you can very easily lose your Medivac and all the Widow Mines if you fly directly into a Viking or Marine pack. Be sure to prioritize keeping the Medivac alive above all else.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '2 Reactored Rax Reapers', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This mass Reaper build order gets 2 Reactored Barracks cranking out 4 Reapers at a time in order to overwhelm your opponent with purely mass Reaper.

Scouting

There is minimal SCV scouting with this build because you will open the same regardless of what your opponent is making. The majority of your scouting comes from your constant Reaper attacks.

Against anything but Banshees, constantly produce Reapers to overwhelm your opponent. Against Banshees, be sure to cancel your Reaper production and start producing 4 Marines at a time. If you have done significant economic damage, then getting an Engineering Bay for a Missile Turret is not a bad idea either.

Transitions

This build actually transitions pretty well into a decent midgame for being an all-in. However, you can only transition into Bio after opening with this build because it is hard to utilize your quick Reactors and two Barracks early on if you are trying to transition into Mech. When you feel like you cannot do any more damage with your Reapers, be sure to stop Reaper production and begin your Bio upgrades.

For a standard Bio follow-up, get your natural expansion, start Marine production, and get a 3rd Barracks with a Tech lab. This way you can start Stimpack, an Engineering Bay, Factory, and 3rd Refinery all at the same time just like as if you had opened with a normal 1rax FE into Medivacs.

For a fast upgrade transition, start your natural expansion, Marine production from the 2 Barracks, 2 Engineering Bays, and then +1/+1. As soon as you can, get one more Barracks with a Tech lab so that you can start researching Stimpack. Then, you can take your third Refinery and get a Factory to go into Reactored Medivacs and +2/+2.

For a follow-up timing attack, start your natural expansion, Marine production, and a Factory instantly.  Get a Tech lab on the Factory and start Siege Tank production in order to hit a very fast Marine/Tank push with your second Siege Tank. Behind this contain/attack, you can get your 3rd base, 3rd and 4th Refineries, double Engineering Bays, and 2 or 3 more Barracks (get Stimpack and Combat Shields).

Execution

As soon as your first Reapers pop, start being aggressive. Your number one goal is to deny your opponents Factory for as long as possible (Hellions or Widow Mines can be difficult to maneuver around), but in order to do this, you have to be in your opponents face with your Reapers as soon as they are built. Also, with your constant harass, be sure to dwindle your opponents Marine count without committing too hard and losing any Reapers.

Your Reaper count increases very quickly, and when you get around 6 to 8 Reapers, you can truly overwhelm most units your opponent can have.  Thus, focus on killing his army with your initial Reapersyou will be able to kill his SCVs once his army is dead.

In general, if your opponent sees what you are doing, you are in trouble.  Thus, it is suggested that at least one of your Barracks is build outside your base (even just at your natural will sometimes work fine). However, you can proxy both Barracks outside your main to make this build a little more all-in too. This also works for some mind games because if your opponent scouts you with a Refinery but no Barracks in your main, he will most likely try to defend proxy Marauders (a defense that is awful on most maps against mass Reaper).

Pros and Cons

This build is very aggressive and can catch many opponents off-guard.  With a hilarious amount of Reapers, you are usually able to overwhelm their army within the first 8 minutes. However, even if the all-in does fail, it can still transition into a 11-12 minute Bio+Stimpack/Medivac timing.

However, if you do not do much damage, you will be quite behind your opponent in tech (and possibly income). Also, this build can be easily scouted if an SCV sees both Reactors building before a single unit, so at least one of the Barracks must be proxied outside of your main.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Refinery,OrbitalCommand,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,DoubleReapers,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleReapers,SCV,DoubleReapers,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleReapers,DoubleReapers,CallMule,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:08 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '1 Rax FE into 2 Medivac Push', @SC2VersionID = '2.0.5', @Description = 'General Overview

This 1rax FE build gives you a strong economy, while staying safe from early Protoss pressure. It then transitions into a strong 10 minute push with +1 attack, Stim, Combat Shields, Concussive shells, and 2 Medivacs.

Scouting

When you send your scouting SCVs, you want to look for gasses, nexus energy, and the units he is producing out of his gateway. If he only has 1 gas before his stalker pops, check to see whether your opponent gets his natural at around 5:15 (You can hide your SCV nearby and then run it in around 5:30) to check for an expansion later if need be. If he has 2 gas and you don?t scout an expansion by 6:00, then be wary of an all-in. The common responses to standard Protoss plays are:
- Nexus First: Bunker rush with 4 Barracks instead of getting your 2nd CC OR Stop making marines at 3, get your 3rd CC and go straight into double upgrades to get a leg up in the macro game.
- Double Gas, No Expansion by 6:00: Get 3 bunkers (and a missile turret if you haven?t ruled out DTs). Pull SCVs to repair and provide a meat shield as necessary.
- 1 Gate Expand: Play normal.

Tips

- To confirm that your opponent is not allining you, have an SCV (or scan) go to his natural just before the 6 minute mark. A 4gate will hit before this timing, but 1 bunker and repair should be able to hold a 4gate easily enough; all other scary allins hit much later and this scout will give you enough time to prepare an appropriate defense.
- Unless you are expecting an allin of some sort, do not make marauders until you?ve started your starport. The 50 gas from making 2 marauders at a time will slow down the push by over a minute.
- Also related to this, you can push your medivac timing earlier by getting your factory before your barracks addons. Because you?re not making marauders just yet anyway, the only difference between getting the addons before factory vs getting them after is that you cut a couple of marines and get a faster medivac timing. Both versions are totally valid.
- Once you have your first marauder out, take your own watchtower by scaring away or killing his stalker ? up until you get a marauder out, you have to stay behind your bunker for defense.
- When you attack with your first 2 medivacs, be sure to scan your opponent?s natural in order to determine how much stuff/how many sentries he has waiting for you. If your opponent has too many units, then double drop the main instead of attacking directly into the natural.  Do NOT engage in chokes against sentries.

Transitions

As you?re pushing out, you will need to place down your 3rd CC, 2nd engibay and armory, 2 more rax, and a ghost academy or 2nd starport to counter your opponent?s HTs or collosi. If you?re feeling safe, then place down the 3rd CC and engibay first. If you?re worried about not having enough units, get the 2 more rax earlier, as well as possibly your ghost academy or 2nd starport before 3rd. Transition into 3 base bio with ghosts/vikings when you have the money.

Pros and Cons

This is probably the most standard 1rax FE. Compared to the other variants, it gives you reasonably timed infrastructure, a very safe opening against most 1 base and early 2 base Protoss all-ins, and of course the exact same economy as the other 1rax FEs.  However, early on you have no map control at all because of how well early stalkers can deal with naked marines in the open field; you don?t get up your 3rd CC extremely fast; and you don?t get up your 5 barracks up as quickly as Bomber?s build.
Other TvP builds, besides the 1rax FE variants, should also be considered. This build gives you a lot smaller army and much later upgrades than MKP?s 2rax early on, in exchange for a much stronger economy and a solid timing attack with Medivacs at around the 10 minute mark. Also, it gives you more scans and SCVs to pull to deal with early DTs and/or pressure. While the 2rax will attack early and hit hard with continued aggression, the 1rax FE will give you a much more powerful attack later on, in exchange for leaving you more vulnerable against the early aggression Protoss can lay on.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,CommandCenter,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,Bunker,Marine,SCV,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Refinery,Refinery,SCV,Marine,CallMule,Marine,Marine,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,Marine,SCV,SCV,Marine,SupplyDepot,StimPack,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Marine,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Factory,EngineeringBay,Refinery,Marine,Marine,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,CombatShield,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Marauder', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:08 PM;

VortiX uses a gasless opening and transitions into a strong Roach Zergling timing, aiming to punish greedier Roach play or swift Mutalisk play.

Scouting

n the early stages of the game, all scouting comes from Overlord vision, so be sure that you send your initial 2 Overlords towards your opponent?s natural expansion. You can use your Overlord to compare his Hatchery?s HP to yours, to determine what kind of opener he used. If his hatchery is stronger than yours, he has gone hatchery first. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is the same HP as yours, he has VERY LIKELY done the same build as you. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is weaker to yours, he has gone for a gas and pool before hatchery in some order, meaning his speed is quicker than yours. Banelings before speed in this scenario is often advised, and likely make the Baneling nest in the main to not lose your Baneling tech to mass Zerglings with speed. An alternative is to not use your Gas, and get extra Queens and 2-3 Spine Crawlers. The main theme here is to not get Speed first, as his WILL be quicker. You need to find an edge that isn?t using Zergling Speed.
When playing versus any very early aggression (<10 pool), use your Drones to defend until you have your own Zerglings, a Queen, and potentially a Spine Crawler. Consider canceling the Hatchery for more minerals. Also use your initial overlord to scout when your opponent is taking their natural Hatchery. Feel free to apply some light pressure with your first Zerglings against a Hatch first build, but do not let it mess up your macro.
Make sure you have 2 to 4 Zerglings out on the map at all times. Send your initial 2 Zerglings to your opponent?s base to spot what they have at the front, and if possible get into the main with 1 Ling to see whether your hatching Drones or Zerglings from their eggs. Use the scouting intel that these pokes give you to determine whether you should get Banelings and extra Zerglings to defend yourself or pressure your opponent, or whether you should continue droning.
If your scout Zerglings see Drones hatching, and no wall at the front, you can choose to make Drones OR Zerglings to pressure. If you scout Zerglings, and no wall at the front, you should make the same amount of Zerglings. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings escape, send them back in to scout in 20~ seconds. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings die, remake the scout. Consider another 2 Zerglings for just-in-case Banelings. If you scout a wall, the Zerg is likely playing passive and you are likely safe.
As soon as you are sure you are safe, transition into your choice of tech.

Transitions

However, because you have not yet committed upgrades to either Ranged or Melee, you can choose between transitioning into Roach Hydra or Ling Ultra.
If you do choose to go for Roaches, immediately research Roach Speed and take your third, while droning as heavily as you can without endangering yourself. You can transition to a similar midgame to that of Vortix?s 3 Base Speed Roach, albeit without the fast upgrades.
It is not recommended you go for a Mutalisk transition.

Tips

Aim to focus down Queens with transfuse energy first, and use Roaches to tank any Baneling hits. Emphasize surrounds with your Speedlings and tank Banelings with your Roaches.

Pros and Cons

This build excels and punishing either greedier Roach players, and players rushing for Mutalisks. If it fails, you are behind as with any timing attack. You do not have any tech, you have no upgrades, and you will almost certainly be behind in drones. Additionally, because you are opening gasless, your defense is likely to be much more difficult. You will have no Banelings or Zergling speed, so your defense will revolve entirely around Spine Crawlers, Queens, and building placement.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Queen,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Drone,RoachWarren,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Extractor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,SpawnCreepTumor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,SpawnCreepTumor,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,SpawnCreepTumor', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:08 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '2 Rax Reaper FE to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with 2 Barracks to produce a lot of Reapers very quickly.  It is a great way to get complete map control with 4 Reapers, apply heavy pressure to an expanding opponent, and transition into standard Bio play.  This 2rax Reaper build also can instantly win against some Gas First or CC First builds.

Scouting

This build is a reasonably safe build against most things Terran can open with as long as you are smart with your initial four Reapers. Thus, SCV scouting early on is not required or even suggested. Use your Reapers to take map control and pick off Marines/scout the front. However, there may come a time when your opponent has a Bunker up and you can no longer poke the front. Then, while prioritizing keeping your Reapers alive over all else, jump into his base and pick off SCVs/continue to scout.

If you scout your opponent opening Banshee, then cease Reaper productioninstead, favor making Marines and getting an earlier Engineering Bay. If you scout a Widow Mine Drop, then be wary of your opponents Medivac, and hole up in your main base until you have enough units to stabilize. If you scout a Marine/Tank/Banshee all-in, then keep your 2nd Command Center in your main base and play defensive. If you scout a 1rax FE, then scout for the Bio or Mech follow-up, and apply pressure whenever possible.

Note: If you scout your opponent going Mech, then add a 2nd Tech lab instead of Reactor on your initial Barracks and build some marauders too.  You can still follow the same basic build order, but you will have a little less gas than normal, so you might need to get early gas geysers than what is written up above.

Transitions

This build commits too much into Infantry upgrades for you to transition into Mech. However, it transitions quite smoothly into Marine/Tank or pure Bio (vs Mech).

For a Marine/Tank transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory for Siege Tank production, take your third base, start your 4th-6th gas geysers, and start another Engineering Bay+Armory for more upgrades. With your midgame push, confirm what unit composition your opponent is going, and play aggressively/passively accordingly.

For a pure Bio transition (if your opponent is playing Mech), start another Engineering Bay and Armory to continue your upgrades as you take your 3rd Command Center and keep your opponent pinned back. Threaten boosted Medivac drops whenever possible, but do not over commit your army if your opponent has an adequate defense.

Pros and Cons

This build is a safe build that also opens aggressively. With this build, you can pick off Marines and SCV, while simultaneously getting a full scout of your opponents base and stressing their multitasking. This build also has a heavy Marine follow up, and can deal with Banshees or 1/1/1 all-ins rather well due to the Reactor/Tech lab first. This transitions into normal Bio play but gives you the advantage due to early harass and map control.

However, this build performs poorly against early Hellion openings. If you scout Reactored Hellions, cease Reaper production instantly and transition into faster Marine/Marauder production. Also, if your opponent holds the Reapers cost-effectively with a 1rax FE or CC First (either due to you mis-microing, or them having a solid defense), then you will be behind going into the midgame economically.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,Barracks,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Reaper,SCV,SCV,Reaper,Reaper,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Barracks,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,CallMule,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,Marine,CombatShield,SCV,Marine,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Refinery,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,Factory,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,EngineeringBay,StimPack,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SCV,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,CallMule,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marine,CallMule,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,LiftFactoryFromReactor,TechLabOnFactory,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:08 PM;

This build appears to be a standard Zerg opener to the untrained eye, but it actually can outright kill most unrefined Terran macro builds in the lower leagues.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. Do your best to stop your opponent from scouting how many Zerglings you are creating. The rest of your scouting will come from your Speedling timing attack. Check whether your opponent is going for a Bio, Mech, or 3CC play. You should at the least be able to force your opponent to lift off their natural unless they made a tight wall ? don?t commit your Speedlings into a meat grinder if your opponent has walled off successfully.

Transitions

As soon as you hit your attack, you need to be droning quite heavily to be able to stand any sort of chance going into the midgame. Only put Drones back in gas and re-begin teching up to Lair, Evolution Chambers, and Mutalisks once you are getting closer to 2 base Drone saturation.

Tips

- Be sure that you take map control with your initial Zerglings. Being able to deny your opponent vision of your building Zerglings will make this attack that much stronger.
- Do NOT attack into a Terran force behind a full wall-off. Force your opponent to abandon their natural and continue droning up.

Pros and Cons

This build looks like a standard ZvT build, but hits your opponent incredibly aggressively with a lot of early game Speedlings. This Speedling timing should either outright win the game or give you an effective economic advantage that will take you into the midgame. However, because you are cutting Drone production in order to support this swell of Zerglings, your economic situation will be much further behind than what you might be used to. If your opponent holds the attack without taking much damage at all, then it?s possible you will simply get rolled over by any sort of counterattack as you are attempting to make Drones.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Extractor,Drone,SpawningPool,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,StartIdle,StopIdleIn5Seconds,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Queen,MetabolicBoost,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:08 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '3gate Proxy Oracle All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This micro-intensive build rushes for a proxy Stargate, and then pumps out Oracles to do damage to your opponents mineral line while simultaneously crushing through your opponents front with a strong Gateway+Mothership Core army.

Attack your opponents main mineral line with 1st Oracle as soon as it finishes (@6:15ish), and push at front with Zealot/Stalker/Mothership Core.

Scouting

This build is an all-in that makes a lot of units, so is safe in general vs an aggressive opponent  the only scouting you need to do is spot where your opponent has spawned and whether or not they have taken gas. If you are performing this build vs a gasless Terran, you can be much more aggressive with your initial 3 units and oracle. Versus a gassing Terran, you must be wary of Widow Mines, so be sure not to clump up your units when pushing up ramps or going into your opponents mineral line with your Oracles.

Transitions

This build is an all-in, so note that there is no clear transition out of it.  Continue making oracles (up to 3 or 4) and warping in Stalkers so that you can break the front. Note that if your opponent does eventually hold and you end up losing your entire army, then you are most likely behind both economically and in tech. Only expand and continue producing Probes once/if you break the front and you are just making sure that you have enough economy to follow up with a win.

Pros and Cons

This build hits very early with a proxied Oracle, taking advantage of the weakness of early game Marines without upgrades. This build is so strong because it gives you enough units to pressure both your opponents front and their mineral line simultaneously. It also then gives you the infrastructure needed to warp-in enough Gateway units to eventually bust down your opponents front.

However, this build is a very micro intensive build  you must be target firing with your Oracle in the main, while not losing any of the units in the front, usually for at least 3 minutes. It is also weak vs Widow Mines if you have poor control. Lastly, note that this build is in fact an all-in, so doing some damage but losing your entire army does put you behind by quite a bit.

Tips

- Chronoboost your initial Stalker so that you deny scouting from your opponent as soon as possible.
- Do not get your initial Probe trapped in your opponents base or killed, for that will force you to send another Probe to build the proxy Pylon and lose more mining time.
- You have to target fire individual SCVs for the Pulsar Beam to be most effective.
- One Oracle can take down 4 Marines if it has enough energy for Pulsar Beam the entire time.
- You can use the Oracles Envision spell for mobile detection in case your opponent has opened Widow Mine or Banshee.
- Be wary of Widow Mines both in the front or in the main mineral line and stay alert of the 40 second cooldown they have between shots.
- Dont forget to use the Mothership Cores Time Warp ability to help vs SCVs/marines in the attack at the front.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '8-8-8 Proxy Reaper', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This all-in gets the fastest possible Reaper with which to do damage against your opponent. It then follows up with another Barracks so that you can make enough Reapers to overwhelm your opponent and outright win the game before it has even begun.

Scouting

You will be doing this build no matter what, so there is no SCV scouting.  The rest of your scouting will come from your Reapers seeing what your opponent has. However, an interesting SCV timing to note: you will reach a very nice proxy location with your SCV on most 2 person maps if you send it out exactly as you get 50 minerals for the first time at 8 supply.

Transitions

There is no defined transition from this build; it is basically all-in after all.  However, if your opponent goes for very quick roaches then you might want to add-on Tech labs and get Marauders. Besides that, you should have enough Reapers to evenly trade with anything your opponent can make, as long as you can stutter step appropriately.

Tips

- Do NOT lose any of your first 3 Reapers. They are the most important part of this build  applying the early pressure, forcing Drones to be pulled, and most importantly stopping Queens/Roaches from being made. If you lose them, you will most likely lose the game.
- Do not stop for Hatcheries or buildings of any kind. Go straight for the Drones and force some to be pulled off the worker line. If your opponent has their full economy up they will simply outproduce you.
- The only micro you have to do is stutter step against Zerglings/Drones, and pull back the weakest Reaper against Queens.
- 4 Reapers will kill a Queen without you losing a single one of them as long as you pull the targeted Reaper back in time.
- In order to hit the exact build order supplies above, you will have to cut some SCVs for several seconds. I highly recommend watching the tutorial replays (and using the Take Command button with a friend to see how you match up to it) until you get a hang of the build.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,GoOutScv,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,SCV,SCV,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,Reaper,Barracks,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Reaper,SCV,Reaper', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:09 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '15 gas FE into Mine Drop to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reactored Rax FE gives you enough Marines to stay safe against early Protoss pressure, while still getting a fast expansion. Then it transitions into a fast Marine/Widow Mine drop to hit your opponent with some pressure of your own. Interestingly, this build can also transition into standard Bio play or macro Mech play.

Scouting

This build is largely safe against any early pressure that Protoss can apply because it gives you a Reactored Barracks to pump out Marines two at a time. Also, if you are feeling unsafe, you have the minerals after your reactor finishes to place down a Bunker at your natural. Also, if your opponent is doing a 1 base all-in, then instead of being aggressive with your Marines/Widow Mines, you can keep them in your main and defend your Bunker/main. By simply constantly producing Widow Mines, Marines, and Medivacs to keep replenishing your defenses, you can remain safe against most all-ins. However seeing the all-ins coming is crucial. Scouting your opponents natural expansion timing with an SCV is huge (if your opponent does not have an expansion started by around 5:30, expect an all-in). Besides seeing an all-in coming, the rest of your midgame scouting will come from seeing how your opponent defends the Widow Mine drop.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because it gets a good economy, but also enough Marines to defend early game Protoss pokes. Then, the Marine/Widow Mine drop gives you complete map control AND keeps your opponent in the dark as to what followup you are doing (Mech/Bio/3CC). Not to mention that if your opponent is not careful, this build can get Widow Mines in your opponents mineral lines and land some huge hits on Probes, essentially winning the game instantly.

However, this build is more vulnerable to later all-ins such as Void ray or Blink+Mothership core all-ins than more standard bio play (because you will not have stim yet), so be sure to position your Widow Mines defensively and add on more bunkers against a Protoss that you have scouted isnt expanding. Also, with poor Medivac control, you can very easily lose your Medivac and all the Widow Mines if you are not careful. Lastly, this build is not quite as economical as a 1rax FE build, but it still gets a pretty reasonably fast expand, so its not too far behind a 1rax FE build in terms of economy at all.

Tips

- Early game Stalker/Mothership Core pressure may be hard to deal with, but position your Marines effectively and hold on until you get out a Widow Mine in order to defend your base.
- Once you have pinned your opponent on an aggressive build (for instance, by scouting a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), do NOT move out; instead, posture your Widow Mines and Marines in an appropriately defensive position.
- Oracles flat out destroy marines, so if you are fighting an opponent going for Stargate, position your Widow Mines by the mineral line and even consider getting out one turret per base.
- When committing to an attack, boost in and drop one Widow Mine at your opponents main-to-natural ramp in order to trap his army on one half of his base. Once you have his ramp locked down, you will have several seconds of complete control of the half of his base where his army is not located. Use these seconds to kill workers and/or position a mine in a crucial location.
- Above all else, the strength of this build is non-stop harass/pressure.

This classic 7 Roach Rush all-in is a great build for newer players to learn one base macro with. It hits a very quick timing that can crush through inexperienced or unsuspecting opponents.

Scouting

This build can be performed against any opener Terran has. The only scouting you need to do is send your initial 2 Overlords to your opponent?s base in order to spot both where your opponent is spawned and whether or not they have a Bunker or Marauders that you will have to break down or fight.

Transitions

This 7 Roach Rush build is a strong 1 base attack that opens with a lot of units and few Drones, so your follow-up will be very slow. That being said, you should start to float some minerals as you are reaching your opponent?s base, so start a natural Hatchery, build a lot more Drones, and get Metabolic Boost as soon as possible. Going for a Lair and getting a Banelings Nest in order to start a Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk composition is a strong way to deal with Terran in the midgame.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong 1 base attack that can crush your opponent early before they have their midgame even established. However, this build can be held off if your opponent scouts it and prepares with a repaired Bunker or Marauders if they have opened with a 1 base play of their own.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '15 Gas Marine-Hellion Expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This fast expansion build created by Innovation uses Hellions to stay safe against Reapers, Banshees, and Hellbatsall while taking map control.

Scouting

Scouting with this build until you get your first Hellions out is not necessary.  However if you want to SCV scout, checking your opponents gas timing clues you in on what they could possibly be doing.

If your SCV sees that your opponent has mined more gas than you have, the most likely are opening with Reapers. However, even if you do not get into your opponents base, you can still tell a Reaper is coming by leaving your scout next to your opponents Barracks to spot whether it dies to a Marine or a Reaper. Your first 2 Marines positioned in your main at a Reaper jump-up spot, followed up by the Reactor for extra Marine production should crush any aggressive Reaper play if you react with and position your initial Marines well. With the Reactored Hellion follow-up you can seize map control and spot if there are any other pushes coming.

When your second Orbital Command finishes and you are still worried about a 1 base play, consider scanning your opponents main base.  Against 1 base play, be sure to have good vision around your base to prevent elevators and to defend your front with a Bunker. Also, a Missile Turret per mineral line with one Viking will shut down any Widow Mine Drops into Cloak Banshee openers. Lastly, if your opponent is going for Hellbat drops, then producing more than 6 Hellions and starting a Viking can be really helpful for your defensenormal Hellions do quite well against Hellbats, and Vikings do quite well at deterring Medivacs.

Execution

If your opponent invested more than 2 Reapers before expanding into bio play, then this is your cue to do heavy damage. If he played greedy and didnt build a bunker at his natural, you can go in with your 4 Hellions, 6 Marines and your first Medivac and kill his un-upgraded Marines. If there is a Bunker at the natural, then simply elevator your Marines and then Hellions into your opponents main and kill as many units as you can.

Against Mech play you might have to play a bit more conservative with your aggression because in Hellion vs Hellion fights, the player who was positioned correctly before the fight usually has the advantage. Instead of committing to an attack or elevator, pulling your army back and placing down a quick 3rd Command Center is a safer way to play.

Against standard Bio play, you can attempt to hit a Marine/Hellion timing at his front with your first 4 Hellions, 6 Marines, and a Medivac. Or, if your opponent is too well defended at the front, perform a 4 Hellion drop and harass his SCVs instead. Getting your 2nd Barracks and starting Stimpack before taking your 3rd Command Center is crucial to staying safe against 10 minute Bio timings and drop play. Alternatively, going Mech and producing Widow Mines/Siege Tanks as you take your third base is a strong way to stay safe as well.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into anything: Marine/Tank or Mech play. Note that as stated in the Execution section above, the follow-up you can do after you get your initial Marine/Hellion/Medivac army is completely dependent on your own preference and the play style of your opponent.

When transitioning into Bio play, against Mech and 3CC builds you can get away with starting your 3rd CC right away and following-up with 2 Barracks with Tech labs (to start Stimpack/Combat Shields), 3 Refineries, and 2 Engineering bays. Against more traditional Bio play it is necessary to start a Tech lab on your initial Barracks for a quicker Stimpack. Then, after taking a 2nd Refinery, you can build a 2nd Barracks onto the naked Reactor and start Siege Tank production to take yourself into the midgame. This is followed up by a 3rd Command Center (between 8:00-8:30), 1 more Barracks, both Refineries at your natural expansion, and 2 Engineering bays. Not having Stimpack completed in time for the inevitable 10ish minute drop play can be a game changer because with the new Medivacs boosting around your main and natural, it is very easy to get caught out of position and take a lot of damage for free.

ForGG does an interesting follow-up where he simply constantly produces Hellions  sometimes going up to 20+ Hellions  and overwhelms his opponents before they have Stimpack or enough Siege Tanks to deal with this attack. Mass Hellions are surprisingly good against opponents who make Hellbats or try drop play without a perfect follow-up.

Another possible follow-up is going for Mech play. This is easily achieved by keeping the Factory onto the Reactor for more Hellions, getting all 4 Refineries while starting more Factories, and starting your 3rd Command Center very quickly. Building some Vikings for drop defense will definitely come in handy as well.

Pros and Cons

This build defends early pressure quite easily, while getting a quick expansion and going into the midgame. Also, once your first Medivac is out, you hit your opponent with lots of pressure early on to kick start an aggressive game. Finally, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for opening with a 1/1/1 grants you the freedom to go into nearly anything.

However, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades. Also, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Factory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,Starport,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SCV,OrbitalCommand,SCV,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,Medivac', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:09 PM;

This fast expansion build created by Maru uses a lot of scouting in order to stay safe against Reapers and Banshees, getting out enough Marines and the infrastructure needed to defend all sorts of aggression that early-game TvT can have.

Scouting

Figuring out your opponents opening so that you can react appropriately when you are performing this build is crucial. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that you SCV scout around 12 or 13 supply in order to see whether your opponent has opened gas first or not.

If your SCV gets into your opponents base and sees that your opponents Barracks is delayed compared to yours, you know that they are opening gas first  the most likely scenario being Polts Gas First Banshee Build.  However, there are some Gas First Hellion openers, so stick around until the first Marine pops so that you can see what add-ons your opponent is making. A fast Tech lab usually will be swapped off onto the Starport for a fast Banshee. A fast Reactor can be used to swap off and go for Hellions.  Against Hellion play, build your Command Center and keep your Marines on the high ground.

If you get into your opponents base and see that your opponent has mined more gas than you have, the most likely scenario is that they are opening with Reapers. Note that even if you do not get into your opponents base, you can still tell a Reaper is coming by leaving your scouting SCV next to your opponents Barracks to spot whether the first unit to pop out is a Marine or a Reaper. Against Reaper play, build your Command Center and position your Marines on the high ground. If your opponent commits to 2rax Reaper or Mass Reaper play, transitioning into Innovations Marine/Hellion Expand to stay safe (instead of taking a 2nd gas and instantly opening with a Starport) is a common reaction. With the Reactored Hellion follow-up you can seize map control and deal with Reapers quite easily.

If your opponent is opening with an expansion of their own or has mined the same amount of gas as you have, then consider cutting the Raven and going into delayed Cloaked Banshee OR Siege Tank production of your own. Whichever you choose is personal preference.

When your second Orbital Command finishes and you are still worried about a 1 base play, consider scanning your opponents main base.  Against 1 base non-Banshee play, starting Siege Tanks and using your Raven for Seeker Missile is an easy way to stay safe. Against 1 base Banshee play, position your Marines and Raven near your production or mineral line as you start a Viking or two for extra defense.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either Marine/Tank/Medivac or Mech play.

When transitioning into Marine/Tank play, against Mech and 3CC builds you can get away with starting your 3rd Command Center right away and following-up with 2 Barracks with Tech labs (to start Stimpack/Combat Shields), 3 Refineries, and 2 Engineering bays.

Against a player opening straight into Bio play, however, it is necessary to start a Tech lab on your initial Barracks as soon as possible for a quicker Stimpack. Then, after taking a 2nd Refinery, you can build a 2nd Barracks onto the naked Reactor and start Siege Tank production to take yourself into the midgame. This is followed up by a 3rd Command Center (between 8:00-8:30), 1 more Barracks, both Refineries at your natural expansion, and 2 Engineering Bays. Not having Stimpack completed in time for the inevitable 10ish minute drop play can be a game changer because with the new Medivacs boosting around your main and natural, it is very easy to get caught out of position and take a lot of damage for free.

Another possible follow-up is going for Mech play. By starting a 3rd Command Center instantly, getting all 4 Refineries, and making 2 more Factories and an Armory, youll instantly be at the midgame infrastructure you need. Be sure to make Vikings for drop defense and start your Siege Tank production instantly so that you have a healthy Siege Tank count to defend any early drops/pressure.

Tips

- Fully read the Scouting section of this build before performing it in a game.  The reactions to scouting information as presented in the Scouting section must be learned before this build is even worth performing in a real game.
- SCV scout with this build at 12 or 13 supply.
- If you are absolutely sure your opponent is not opening with Banshee play, then starting delayed Banshee production of your own instead of the Raven is a great way to get midgame map control and a lot more scouting information.
- Against the first Banshee, you might need to pull all of your Marines to your production or mineral line while you wait for the Raven to pop.  This is completely fine  try to minimize damage by pulling all of your SCVs to one location so that your Raven provides detection over all of your vulnerable spots once it is out.
- Anticipate how many Banshees your opponent is making and either continue to produce Vikings or stop after 1 or 2 for safety.
- Be sure to transition into your midgame infrastructure as soon as you have successfully defended the Banshees.

Pros and Cons

This build defends early pressure quite easily, while getting a quick expansion and going into the midgame. Also, this build is incredibly versatile when it comes to transitions, for opening with a 1/1/1 grants you the freedom to transition into nearly anything.

However, this build requires a lot of scouting in order to be performed effectively. The reactions and transitions you must perform depend entirely on your scouting information and interpretation of your opponents build order.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Factory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,Refinery,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Starport,DoubleMarines,SCV,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,LandStarportOnTechLab,Raven,WidowMine,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,ScannerSweep,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,LiftStarportFromTechLab,LandFactoryOnTechLab,SiegeTank,SupplyDepot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:09 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Alicia 12-12 Colossus All-In', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build utilizes an unconventional Gateway and gas timing to produce a fast Mothership Core for scouting before smoothly transitioning into a 2 Colossus All-in.

Attack your opponent when your 2nd Colossus finishes (@9:30ish) with 2 Colossi, 3 Stalkers, 3 Sentries, and a Mothership Core with about 45 Probes at home.

Scouting

Do not Probe scout with this build. Because you are using a 12/12 opening, you will have an extremely early Mothership Core for immediate scouting. Your Mothership Core should be directly rallied to the enemy base upon completion.

The early Mothership Core allows you to see exactly what a Terran is aiming for. If they are aiming for Factory aggression with a Starport simply chronoboost out 2 Observers, placing one in each base. Position your 3 Stalkers in the main to catch a drop. Bring your Mothership Core home and use it to defend the natural with Photon Overcharge. This defensive setup should allow you to defend any multi-pronged aggression from the Terran.

If it is merely a 2 base, 3 Barracks opener, then proceed as normal.

Transitions

As this is an all-in, the transitions for this build are heavily dependent on the damage you deal. If you kill a significant amount of workers but find yourself unable to finish your opponent off, transition into normal Blink/Colossus play. If you do not kill many workers and lose your army, then you most likely will lose to a follow-up counterattack. If you trade armies but do eventually lose your own, you are free to instantly transition into anything you wantBlink/Colossus, Chargelot/Archon, or Storm play are all equally viable. Remember to start 2 Forges and chronoboost your upgrades to catch up in the upgrade war.

Tips

Produce a third Colossus and leave it at home along with your Mothership Core. This allows you to effectively defend counter aggression with 2 Photon Overcharges. You have enough punch in your frontal push with Forcefield and Guardian Shield not to require Time Warp.

Only chronoboost your 10th and 13th Probe before the completion of your Cybernetics Core. You need to bank energy to allow you to simultaneously chronoboost your Mothership Core and first Stalker. Otherwise your scouting information is delayed and a Reaper can play havoc with your main.

Once you have completed your Mothership Core and initial Stalker, return to chronoboosting Probes until the completion of your Robotics Bay. At this point exclusively chronoboost Colossi. If you find you have spare Nexus energy chronoboost Thermal Lance but prioritize accelerating your Colossus count  your push begins once both Colossi have been completed.

Pros and Cons

This all-in is one of the most difficult to scout builds currently available to Protoss. To most Terran players it will look like standard macro play and may even prompt incorrect reactions such as earlier Medivac aggression or a fast 3rd Command Center. Also, because of the fast Mothership Core scout, you will almost always be able to identify Terrans early game build structure (3rax, 1/1/1, etc).

However, because your Mothership Core stays at home for defense and you have no upgrades to fall back on, your attack is fully all-inthere is no way to retreat your Colossus safely if your attack fails and you are certain to fall behind in upgrades as the game stretches on.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Stalker,Chronoboost,WarpgateUpgrade,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Assimilator,Stalker,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,Nexus,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Chronoboost,Stalker,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Observer,RoboticsBay,Assimilator,Assimilator,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,WarpInSentry,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Pylon,Probe,Probe,ExtendedThermalLance,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:09 PM;

This variant on the standard 1rax FE build gets the midgame infrastructure up much earlier for a lot of midgame aggression, while sacrificing early safety against one and early two base Protoss attacks.

Scouting

When you send your scouting SCV, look for the number of gasses your opponent has, their Nexus energy, and also the units they are producing out of the Gateway. If he only has 1 gas before his stalker pops, check to see whether your opponent gets his natural at around 5:15 (You can hide your SCV nearby and then run it in around 5:30 to check for an expansion later if need be). If he has 2 gas or is not spending his chronoboost, then be wary of any sort of early attack.

Tips

- To confirm that your opponent is not all-inning you, have an SCV (or scan) go to his natural just before the 6 minute mark.  A 4gate will hit before this timing, but 2 bunkers and repair should be able to hold a 4gate easily enough; all other all-ins hit much later and this scout will give you enough time to mount an appropriate defense.
- You cannot afford Marauders with this build until you start the Starport. The 100 extra minerals and 50 gas from making 2 Marauders at a time will slow down the push by over a minute.
- Take map control when you initially poke out with your first two Medivacs. Do NOT engage Protoss yet though. This build sets up your infrastructure for a lot of reinforcements, but does not increase your army size until those reinforcements have actually arrived.
- Once the first or second wave of units from all 5 Barracks have popped (you should be making 3 Marauders and 4 marines at a time), straight up fight Protoss? army. Spread your army, kite Zealots, pick up units trapped between forcefields and zealots with Medivacs, and dodge storms as best you can. However, do not forget to build reinforcing units, and do not stop the aggression unless you are forced to. During this aggression, you also get to see what army composition your opponent has.  Get a 4th Refinery.  Then react appropriately to Colossus by making Vikings (and possibly a 2nd Starport) and to High Templar by making Ghosts.

Transitions

During the fighting, place down your 3rd CC, 2nd Engineering Bay and Armory, and Ghost academy or 2nd Starport to counter your opponent?s HTs or Colossi. Fighting your opponent across the map forces them to reveal which tech path they?ve gone down and safely give you the time you need to counter it before it comes to your base.

Pros and Cons

This 1rax FE variant cuts many early-game corners compared to other 1rax FEs.  Delaying the 2nd Refinery means that you cannot afford any Marauders at all until after your Starport has been started. Thus, in case your opponent does an early-game attack, you have to rely on Bunkers and SCVs to repair and tank damage much more than you would in other builds. However, what this build lacks in the early game it more than makes up for in the mid game. Getting five Barracks up that fast means that you can apply a lot of midgame aggression against your opponent.

Simple, economical, and deceptively dangerous, Bomber takes us back to 2012 with an incredibly early 16 Marine Combat Shield Push that simultaneously takes a 6:00 3rd. An excellent low APM alternative for players who dislike Reapers and Hellions.

Scouting

Because you are not opening Reapers, you are in danger of unexpected Roach or Speedling attacks. And because you are not making Hellions, you will have difficulty confirming the existence of a Zerg third base if Speedlings are on the map, as well as being vulnerable to unscouted Baneling Busts. As such, your only SCV scout is crucial in determining if your Zerg opponent has opened with gas or not.

If your opponent has opened gasless, keep your scouting SCV alive and hidden as long as possible to confirm the existence of a third base by 6:30. If no third is taken by 6:30, it is worth scanning, as many dangerous builds, such as Soulkeys 1-1 Roach Timing, start gasless off of two bases.

If your opponent has opened gas but stopped mining at 100 gas, assume that Speedlings are on the way. As such, depending on how quickly your opponent chose to take his gas, a wall off is necessary before six minutes. It is fine to use your 3rd CC as part of your natural wall off on certain maps, such as Frost, Yeonsu, and Polar Night. However, if your opponent went for much faster Speedlings (Gas -> Pool -> Hatch), then it is advisable to wall off ASAP using Depots and bunkers, and delaying your 3rd CC. Additionally, consider not performing your Marine timing if the speedling count is abnormally high (30 or above).

If your opponent has opened gas but has continued mining past 100, it is necessary to check whether or not Metabolic Boost is researching with your scouting SCV. Beyond that, scan to see what is coming your way and build extra bunkers if necessary. You are specifically looking for a combination of the following: obvious tech cues (baneling nest, roach warren, fast lair), lack of Queens/Creep Spread (if there are only two injecting, then something is wrong), lack of Evolution Chambers, lack of a timely third base, and a flood of overlords.

It is highly reommended you do not perform your timing unless it is obvious your opponent is opening nonthreatening gas tech, such as Overlord Speed or very fast upgrades. And finally, depending on what you scout, if it becomes very obvious that no timing will occur, consider getting Stimpack instead of Combat Shields, as well as producing Marauders from your tech labbed Barracks.

Transitions

Because you have already invested so much infrastructure into Barracks and infantry upgrades, your only transition from this build is a bio based composition. However, because you have invested no money whatsoever into Factory tech, you can transition smoothly into Biomine, Biobat, Biobat with Thors, Marine Tank, or even Pure Bio.

Additionally, the Factory and Engineering Bay ordering is entirely up to the users discretion. If you feel you are in danger of a counter all in, or want faster Medivacs for aggression, then start the Factory first. If you feel that you do not want to fall behind in upgrades, start two Engineering bays first.

Tips

Your first priority with this build is accurately assessing whether or not you can do damage with a timing push.

If you feel you can do damage with the timing, do your best to ensure your opponent has as little idea of it as possible. Have lone marines ready at your base to deny Overlord scouting, and hide the bulk of your marines on the main ramp connecting to the natural base. Keep your Barracks away from the edges of your base; especially the one with a researching Tech Lab. If there is a way to construct a third base that an Overlord can obviously see it (such as by the natural choke at Polar Night, where there is almost always an overlord), then that would be best. Most Zergs upon seeing such an early third will let their guard down and drone heavily.

As youre moving out with the Marine squad at 7:00, have at least two scans saved and do your best to avoid obvious overlord positions, and either clear the towers beforehand (impossible vs Speedlings) or avoid them altogether if possible. The best possible scenario is you catch your opponent completely off guard with no Larva banked in the middle of a huge cycle of drones, with 16 marines at his third base.

Use your banked scans as best you can to clear huge swatches of creep, with priority on active tumors. If you do kill the third, use your discretion to decide whether or not attacking further into the natural (emphasis now on the Evolution Chambers or Nat Hatch) or retreating with your marines is the better choice.

DO NOT REINFORCE THIS PUSH. It relies heavily on the element of surprise. Once Zerg reacts and begins to produce cycles of defending units, your reinforcements (3 marines every 25 seconds) will be easily overwhelmed without force multipliers such as Widow Mines, Medivacs, or Battlecruisers.

During the actual engagements, stutter stepping and positioning are critical. Wedging all your marines into the mineral line of his third and using his hatchery as a choke seems to be the optimal engagement zone. If slow banes are involved, split as best you can without stim or target fire them down.

On the other hand, if you feel you cannot do damage with your timing, theres no problem whatsoever. Stay behind your walloff, make bunkers if necessary, and wait for Factory Tech and Medivacs to perform a standard creep clearing push. You are already ahead with your 6:00 3rd and triple MULE income.

Pros and Cons

This build is one of the most economical builds available while still having a surprising amount of potential to outright win a game. It also deflects non baneling based aggression excellently, such as Roach Ling timings. Additionally, the build has a surprising amount of creep clearing potential, as few Zergs will stand toe to toe with 16 Combat Shield Marines this early in the game; most Zergs will surrender their creep without a fight.

The weaknesses of this build, however, are equally apparent.If scouted, the push has a high chance of outright failing. In addition, because your infrastructure is so limited during and following the attack (3 mostly naked Barracks), you are extremely susceptible to counter all ins and heavy Baneling based counter attacks, especially after you kill their third but lose all 16 marines in the process.

And finally, because you have not opened Reapers or hellions, your information is extremely limited, and confirming the existence of a third base can be very difficult if you lose your scouting SCV too early on.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,OrbitalCommand,Marine,CommandCenter,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,Marine,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,OrbitalCommand,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Marine,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,CombatShield,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,CommandCenter,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Marine,Refinery,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,Marine,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,CallMule,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,EngineeringBay,EngineeringBay,ReactorOnBarracks,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,StimPack,OrbitalCommand,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,InfantryArmorLevel1,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Factory,Refinery,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marauder,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SCV,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Marauder,Armory,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,CallMule,TechLabOnFactory,Factory,SCV,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DrillingClaws,Barracks,Barracks,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,ConcussiveShells,InfantryWeaponsLevel2,InfantryArmorLevel2,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,ReactorOnFactory,CommandCenter,Marauder,DoubleMedivacs', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:09 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Bomber Reaper FE to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE, optimized by Startale Bomber, gets out exactly one Reaper for scouting as well and a ridiculously fast Command Center. Then it follows up with a Bio army with just as much strength as a gasless 1rax FE can provide.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they get an expansion (or note if they do not expand by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Also, if you do not know whether your opponent has a Stargate or not, it is a safe plan to build one Missile Turret per mineral line to defend any Oracle shenanigans.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and Medivacs. After this build, get a 3rd Command Center, 3 more Barracks (for a total of 8), and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to head into a strong, late game army.

Note: It is completely viable to replace the 4th and 5th Barracks in this build with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost, most Terrans (including Startale Bomber) have been getting lots of Barracks early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having those extra reinforcements.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important  be sure to mine exactly 100 Gas so that you have enough for the Reaper and Reactor and no more.  Getting your natural Command Center up before the 2nd Supply Depot is a strength of this build.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add a 2nd Bunker at the front, and consider getting a Missile Turret in each mineral line.
- Oracles, even with an expansion, massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you have to instantly get out one Missile Turret per mineral line.
- The gas timings of this build are somewhat more delayed than what you might be used to if you usually play with a gasless 1rax FE.  Therefore, be sure to cut all Marauder production until after your Starport has completed.
- When you move out with your Medivacs, be sure to boost in and out of where your opponent is expecting.  Forcing out the Mothership Cores energy can be the difference between an quick win and a potential loss.

Pros and Cons

This build is good because it gives you the economy and infrastructure on par with a Wings of Liberty style 1rax FE. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Getting such a fast Reactor gives you enough marines to defend early game Stalker + Mothership Core harass.  Finally, this build takes no detours and goes directly into Bio+Medivac play, so your Stim+Medivac aggression happens much sooner than if you go for an early Widow Mine Drop.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes, especially if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that with such a low Marine count in the early game, fast Oracles can do a lot of damage if your scouting/turret timing is not perfect.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Barracks,Bunker,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,StimPack,Marine,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,Factory,EngineeringBay,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,Marine,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Marine,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Starport,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnFactory,ScannerSweep,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,CombatShield,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,SCV,DoubleMedivacs,Marauder,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Barracks,Barracks,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,InfantryArmorLevel1,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,DoubleMedivacs,SCV,SCV,Barracks,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:09 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Dear Flexible Phoenix Expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Stargate for Phoenix and some early ground units to provide the infrastructure necessary to react to every build an opposing Protoss might throw at you.

Benchmark: When your Nexus finishes (@6:45ish), you should have 3 Phoenix, 1 Sentry, 1 Stalker, a Mothership Core, and around 23 Probes.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker back to the protection of your Sentry quickly if you have to defend an early attack.

The majority of your scouting comes from your Phoenix. Your Phoenix should be able to get into your opponents main base and determine what tech route you see your opponent going.

- If your opponent is expanding quickly, then feel safe while applying some light harass with your Phoenix. You can dictate the pace of the game by committing to a lot of Phoenix or starting a Twilight Council or Robotics Facility and defaulting back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then be sure that deal some economic damage with your initial Phoenix. Either commit to Phoenix and Void Rays or default back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.
- If your opponent has a Stargate, then be sure to not take damage against early Phoenix or Oracles by initially positioning your units defensively.  Getting a healthy Phoenix lead against your opponent will most likely be enough for you to end the game.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then consider getting a Robotics Facility instantly in order to make one Observer for detection against DTs.  Alternatively, you can position your units with an Oracle at your main ramp and defend for a while. Regardless, do not make more Phoenix and instead transition into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame with your economic advantage.

Transitions

This build is a very safe opener that gives you the scouting capabilities and infrastructure to react to any build your opponent can perform. However, the actual steps you take to transition into a stable midgame often depend completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with. This is why scouting with your Phoenix and generally being active on the map (perhaps with a delayed scouting Probe) is crucial.

In Stargate vs Twilight macro games, harass your opponent with your Phoenix, but transition out of Stargate units into an economic Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame as soon as possible. In Stargate vs Robotics macro games, again harass your opponent to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you get a healthy Chargelot/Archon count up. Keep tabs on your opponents tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Stargate vs Stargate macro games, position your Phoenix more defensively while you chronoboost your Phoenix non-stop.

The most common way to start the transition into Chargelot/Immortal/Archon is by starting a Robotics Facility and 2 more Assimilators, followed by a Twilight Council and Forge for +1 Ground Weapons and Zealot Charge. Add on the Templar Archives and Archons when you can afford it.

Tips

- Once you start your Mothership Core, save your chronoboost so that you can dump it all into Phoenix. There is no need to chronoboost Warpgate (unless you spot your opponent going for very early aggression).
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial few Gateway units to stop a Probe from setting up a proxy Pylon and allowing for a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Traps 3gate All-in).
- Against Stargate play, position your Stargate units defensively around your mineral lines to defend potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- Otherwise, always be active with your Phoenixes. The main priority for the Phoenix is to get scouting information, for only when you have a full read on your opponents build can you can start chronoboosting probes and enter the midgame.
- Even though you open with a Stargate, transitioning into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon unit composition in the midgame can be very strong.
- When entering the late game, however, be sure to produce Tempest from your inactive Stargateespecially against a Colossus-based opponent.

Pros and Cons

This build is a versatile, economic build that can harass your opponent and provide the scouting information necessary to defend a fast expansion.  Also, your Phoenix can do terrible, terrible damage to Robo-based build such as duckdeoks 3Gate Robo, and even perform well in a macro game against greedy builds such as NaNiwas Safe Expand.

However, this build requires a lot of scouting information to be executed effectively. It also is quite difficult to defend early attacks if you do not kill your opponents proxy Pylon.

This build opens with a 3 Gateways and Blink, using a Hallucinated Phoenix to scout for potential Dark Shrine or Stargate shenanigans. It produces a healthy Stalker count to apply pressure to your opponent or safely secure your expansion against any all-in.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker(s) back to the protection of your Sentry quickly if you have to defend an early attack.
The majority of your scouting comes from your Hallucinated Phoenix. Your phoenix should be able to get into your opponent?s main base and determine what tech route you see your opponent going.
- If your opponent is expanding quickly, then consider warping in Stalkers non-stop from a proxy Pylon as you all-in your opponent with a Blink all-in. Should you choose to expand instead, you will be slightly behind economically ? but with Blink.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then be sure that you do NOT over produce Stalkers.  Instead, expand and fall back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.
- If your opponent has a Stargate, then be sure to not take damage against early Phoenix or Oracles by initially positioning your Stalkers defensively. You can expand quite easily behind your Blink play and go into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame or all-in your opponent if you spot them taking a fast expansion behind the Stargate.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then consider getting a Robotics Facility instantly in order to make one Observer for detection against DTs. If you are sure your opponent is also opening with Blink, then constantly produce Immortals and defend a natural expansion OR skip the Robotics Facility entirely and try to win the Blink Stalker vs Blink Stalker micro war.

Transitions

This build is a very safe opener that allows you either to all-in your opponent with Blink Stalkers or transitions into a macro game quite easily. However, the actual steps you take to transition into it often depend completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with. This is why scouting with the Hallucinated Phoenix and generally being active on the map with your Blink Stalkers is crucial.
If you choose to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly produce Stalkers 3 at a time from your proxy Pylons and attack as soon as Blink Research is finished (@7:40ish). Bait out a Planetary Nexus and/or kill the Mothership Core and as many Sentries as possible before fully committing to an attack. If your opponent is on one base, you can still expand at home ? using your Sentry to force field the ramp to stop his army from coming down and engaging you with his entire army.
In Twilight vs Stargate macro games, abuse your mobility to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you have a strong midgame Chargelot/Immortal/Archon army ready. In Twilight vs Robotics macro games, again abuse your mobility to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you get a healthy Chargelot/Archon count up.  Keep tabs on your opponent?s tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Twilight vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponent?s potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by getting a Robotics Facility and producing Observers/Immortals or by winning the Blink Stalker vs Blink Stalker position battles in the open field.
The most common way to start the transition into Chargelot/Immortal/Archon is by starting a 2nd Nexus, a Robotics Facility and 2 more Assimilators, a Forge for +1 Ground Weapons, and Zealot Charge research in that order. Add on the Templar Archives and Archons when you can afford it.

Tips

- Once you start your Mothership Core, save your chronoboost so that you can dump it all into Blink Research. Only 1 or 2 chronoboosts should be spent on Warpgate (unless you spot your opponent going for very early aggression).
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial Stalkers to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap?s 3gate All-in).
- Against Stargate play, be sure to position your units to defend your mineral line from potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- If you choose to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly chronoboost Blink and then later your Gateways to get the maximal amount of units out with Blink as soon as possible. Bait out a Planetary Nexus and/or kill the Mothership Core and as many Sentries as possible before fully committing to an attack. If your opponent is on one base, you can still expand at home ? using your Sentry to force field the ramp to stop his army from coming down and engaging you with his entire army.
- If you choose to expand behind this build, do not produce more than 8 Stalkers which you should use to take map control and poke your opponent?s front. Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases. Transitioning into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon unit composition is very strong.

Pros and Cons

This build is a versatile, aggressive build that can pressure your opponent or defend basically any all-in with Blink Stalkers. It gets a fast Hallucinated Phoenix scout your opponent?s main base and let you know if you need detection, should reposition your army, or all-in your opponent.
However, this build requires a lot of scouting information to be executed effectively, so getting a Hallucination into your opponent?s base is crucial.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Dear Phoenix into Colossus', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Forge Fast Expand and then gets several Phoenix for map control and scouting. While you are using the scouting Phoenix, you transition into Colossus play in order to secure your third base and set up a stable midgame OR all-in your opponent with a Stalker/Colossus/Phoenix army.

Scouting

After any early game shenanigans are ruled out, as you have spotted your opponent?s third Hatchery going down, the rest of your scouting will come from your Phoenix.

Use your Phoenix to first pick off every Overlord on the map that is undefended by creep/Queens. Then use them to poke around your opponent?s base ? picking up units not protected by Spore Crawlers/Queens. Be sure to focus on what tech structures you see your opponent making. If you spot a swell of Roaches, stay on 2 bases and consider extra Immortals. If you spot a Hydralisk Den, be sure your Robotics Bay is constantly producing Colossus. If you spot a Spire, instantly get a Twilight Council and go for Blink/+2 Ground Weapons while you resume Phoenix production from your Stargate. You might have to cancel your Colossus production.

Transitions

This build can either all-in off of 2 bases or safely secure a third base to comfortably play a macro game.

If you are choosing to all-in with this build, be sure to go up to 8 Gateways and 3 Colossus with Extended Thermal Lance before moving out. Constantly reinforce with Stalkers as you use your +1/+1, 3-Colossus, 5-Phoenix, 8 Gateway all-in to crush through a Roach/Hydra based army. Watch out for Viper play, though!

If you are choosing to play the macro game, timing your third base is tricky. Dear warps in a lot of Zealots from his 4 Gateways before securing his third if he sees any amount of units on the map with his constant Phoenix scouting. If Dear doesn?t see any Roach/Ling force out on the map (as in game 3 of Dear vs Soulkey), then he will take it even before his first Colossus is started. As you take your third base, set up a Cannon defense surrounded by Pylons/Gateways to help with Zergling runbys as you tech up into the late game. Getting a Twilight Council to continue +2 Ground Weapons and Blink is a solid way to both deal with tech switches and set you up for a 3 base attack. Be sure to spend your excess minerals on proxy Pylons and Zealot runbys to keep your opponent?s base count in check.

Tips

- Spend all of your early game chronoboost on your two Nexus to maximize Probe production.
- The exact FFE build order you use is up to your personal preference. Dear has performed this build after a Forge First FFE, Nexus First FFE, and a failed attempted Cannon Rush.
- If possible, hide the Stargate somewhere in your base that is less likely to be scouted by an Overlord.
- Chronoboost your Stargate to get out those Phoenix as quickly as possible to deny any Overlord scouting of your follow-up Robotics transition.
A main strength of this build is its versatility, but you can only be versatile if you have the necessary scouting information. Scouting your opponent?s tech path and army production with your Phoenix is crucial.
- If you spot your opponent playing very greedy, you can choose to warp-in all of your Zealots from your 4 Gateways aggressively and hit a +1 Zealot/Phoenix timing while continuing the build at home.
- Chronoboost your Robotics Facility to get out your Colossus as quickly as possible and set up a solid midgame army.

Pros and Cons

This build is an incredibly versatile build that can be used as a macro opener or a 2 base all-in. It gets out early Phoenix for scouting and map control while transitioning into a solid ground based Colossus midgame.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'DeMusliM Reaper FE', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This HotS Reaper FE, optimized by Flash and DeMusliM, gets out exactly one Reaper for scouting and a ridiculously fast Engineering Bay for an early +1 Infantry Attack in order to hit a 10 minute timing with +1/+1, Stimpack, and Medivacs.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (opening with a Reaper FE means that you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they expand (or note if they do not get a fast expansion by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Also, if you do not know whether or not your opponent has built a Stargate, taking advantage of your ridiculously fast Engineering Bay to build a Missile Turret is not a bad idea too.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and Medivacs.  After this build, secure your 3rd Command Center, continue your upgrades with +2 Infantry Attack, build 6 more Barracks (for a total of 8), and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to go into a strong, late game army. Your fast third Command Center and early upgrades means that your late game army will be much stronger than your opponents assuming that you are able to deny their third base with your initial Medivac poke.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important  be sure to mine exactly 100 Gas so that you have enough for the Reaper and Reactor and no more.  Getting your natural Command Center up before the 2nd Supply Depot is a major strength of this build.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add a 2nd Bunker at the front, and consider getting a Missile Turret in each mineral line. 
- Oracles, even with an expansion, massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you have to instantly get out one Missile Turret per mineral line.
- The gas timings of this build are somewhat more delayed than what you might be used to if you usually play with a gasless 1rax FE.  Therefore, be sure to cut all Marauder production until after your Starport has completed.
- Try not to take any huge engages against your Protoss opponent with your initial Medivacs unless you are sure you can do damage.  With only 2 Barracks producing units, and such a fast 3rd Command Center, your army is not designed to outright win the game  rather to further your economic and upgrade advantage in order to win the game at a later point.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because it gives you the economy and infrastructure on par with a Wings of Liberty style 1rax FE. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Not to mention the fact that you also get a ridiculously early Engineering Bay in order to kick start your Bio upgrades very early. This build also takes no detours and goes directly into Bio+Medivac play, so your Stim+Medivac aggression happens much sooner than if you go for early Widow Mines.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes, especially if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that with such a low Marine count in the early game, fast Oracles can do a lot of damage if your scouting/Missile Turret timing is not perfect.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Bunker,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,EngineeringBay,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SCV,OrbitalCommand,Barracks,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,Factory,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Refinery,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,StimPack,SCV,SCV,Starport,DoubleMarines,Marine,ReactorOnFactory,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,ScannerSweep,Marauder,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,InfantryArmorLevel1,CallMule,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marauder,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Armory,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,CommandCenter,CallMule,SCV,SCV,DoubleMedivacs,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CombatShield', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:10 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Duckdeok 3gate Robo', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a 3 Stalker Rush to take map control, and follows up with a 1base 3gate Robo in order to pressure you opponent, get detection, and play safe against Blink/Stargate builds. This pressure build produces somewhat stable macro games if you react appropriately to your scouting information.

Scouting

For all early game scouting, please refer to the Scouting section of the 3 Stalker Rush build.

After your initial units have scouted around your side of the map, the majority of your scouting will come from your 3gate pressure at your opponents base.

- If your opponent is fast expanding, then attempt to cancel the Nexus before it finishes. Warp in more units at your proxy Pylon for extra pressure.
- If your opponent has just as many (or almost as many) Gateway units as you, immediately fall back and begin Immortal production. Against either Gateway attacks or Blink All-ins, you need a high Immortal count in order to defend.
- If your opponent does not have as many Gateway units as you, then push up the ramp and attempt to kill his army. Do NOT over-commit once your opponent has activated Photon Overcharge. If you cannot push up his ramp, then warp-in a Sentry or two at his natural and set up a contain while you expand back at home. If during the contain a Stargate unit flies into your base, be sure to activate your Photon Overcharge in order to keep your Probes alive.

Transitions

Once you have set up or a contain or you are forced to retreat back home, be sure to setup your natural expansion. Going into the macro game, however, the actual unit composition of your army very often depends completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with.  If your opponent stays on one base for too long, then throw down more Gateways, constantly make units, and prepare to defend your natural with Stalkers, Immortals, and your Planetary Nexus. In Robotics vs Stargate macro games, quickly switch into Blink or double Stargate play of your own so as to not lose against any Void Ray based armies. In Robotics vs Robotics macro games, Immortal count and/or Colossus count are the most important things. Keep tabs on your opponents tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Robotics vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponents potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by producing Immortals+Gateway units or Colossus for defense.

Tips

- Split your initial chronoboost on Probes and Warpgate Research in the early game so that you are not economically behind but still have a quick Warpgate attack.
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial 3 Stalkers to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Traps 3gate All-in).
- Against fast tech plays, your initial 3gate pressure should give you information on both the type and timing of your opponents attack. Be sure not to over-commit your Stalkers here, however, for Blink or Immortal all-ins will be able to hold your attack and counter-attack with a lot of force if you are careless with your initial units.
- Against Blink play (or your opponent has a lot of Stalkers when you pressure), be sure to pull back immediately and start Immortal production.
- Against Stargate play, use your Photon Overcharge to push back any Oracles or Phoenix if your Stalker army is out of position.
- Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very versatile, safe build that takes advantage of early Gateway units to apply pressure as well as defend every sort of all-in that can hit you. It also gets detection and Immortals for defense against ground-based all-ins, so very often you have a more stable opening than most other PvP builds.

However, this build forces you to be active on the map with your initial units. If you over commit your army unnecessarily or do not interpret your scouting information correctly, late all-ins can be very hard to stop.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,MothershipCore,Stalker,Stalker,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,Probe,Stalker,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Pylon,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:10 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Duckdeok 2 Base Blink Push', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This 1gate FE follows up with a 6gate, 2 base Blink Stalker attack, using the Mothership Core for high ground vision and Time Warp.

Benchmark: When Blink finishes (@7:40ish), you should have with 6 Stalkers and 36 Probes at home.

Attack your opponents natural/main with your first full warp-in from all 6 Gateways (@8:30ish) with 12 Blink Stalkers and constant Stalker reinforcements.

Scouting

This build is an aggressive opener that makes a lot of units, so you will not have to worry about Probe scouting. Against Reaper play, keep your first Stalker on a common hop-up ledge in order to deny your opponent scouting the Twilight Council. Against other defensive play, poke out to your opponents front with your first Stalker and check to see whether your opponent is going for Widow Mines or a quick CC into Bio so you know how to micro when you Blink into his main base with all of your units.

Transitions

This build is a strong 2 base Blink Timing that commits a lots of resources to Stalkers and no resources to upgrades or tech, so your follow-up will be quite slow. If your attack does damage and you keep most of your units alive, then you can start 2 more Assimilators, 2 Forges, and a Templar Archives, in order to transition into a Chargelot/Storm unit composition with Blink Stalkers to help deal with drops. However, if you do not deal some damage with your initial Stalkers, then you will be behind both economically and in tech against an opponent who will have Stimpack and Medivacs soon to follow.

Tips

- Do not bother Probe scouting early on because you can do this build against nearly everything your opponent chooses to open with.
- With your initial Stalkers, either protect your main base from a Reaper scouting your Twilight Council or move out and poke up at your opponents base for some early scouting intel.
- The limiting factor with this build is Blink Researchs build time and finishing your 6 Gateways, so be sure to Chronoboost Blink Research constantly in order to attack as soon as possible.
- Keep your Mothership Core out of harms way.  Use its 14 sight range for high ground vision, but do not commit the Mothership Core in the attack because without high ground vision, your attack will most likely fail.
- Do not forget to use your Mothership Cores Time Warp ability to help pick off SCVs or Bio units that are out of position.
- Do NOT over-commit your Stalkers in a risky blink. Only aggressively blink to get up to a high ground or to pick off a Siege Tank/Widow Mine before it activates.
- Constantly warping-in more Stalkers to reinforce your army and add strength to the attack is key to crushing through your opponents defenses.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong build because of how quickly you get both high ground vision with your Mothership Core and enough Blink Stalkers to do real damage  after opening with a 1gate FE. While your opponent might have Stimpack done in time for the attack, you can still beat your opponent in the open field if you use Time Warp and Blink appropriately.

However, this build commits a lot of resources to the attack, so transitioning into standard play will be much further behind if you had just rushed for High Templars and upgrades. Also, if your Stalker positioning is sub-optimal, a Reaper may scout your Twilight Council and reveal the build before you have even moved out to attack.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Nexus,MothershipCore,WarpgateUpgrade,Pylon,Stalker,GasProbe,GasProbe,TwilightCouncil,Probe,Probe,Stalker,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Blink,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,WarpInStalker,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,Probe,Probe,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:10 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'FanTaSy Mine Drop into Banshee', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This aggressive build hits your opponent with relentless harassment, either outright winning the game or giving you a considerable economic advantage before even entering the midgame. Also, with Widow Mine and Banshee play, this build force a lot of scans  giving you another sort of economic advantage going into the midgame.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your 1st Refinery so as to check whether your opponent is opening Reapers or not. Against a Reaper player, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe and try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or an expansion at your natural with your first Marines.

Your next scout will come with your Widow Mine Drop. With this drop you can check what your opponents opener is. Against a Banshee player, you can following through with the build and trying to out-micro him in Banshee vs Banshee harass, or you can cancel your banshee and start a Viking and Engineering Bay for a Turret to play safe. Against a Hellbat Dropping player, make a few more Widow Mines to position them defensively against any incoming drop as you use your Widow Mine Drop and incoming Banshee to out-harass him. Against a player going for a similar Widow Mine Drop, you can either pull back and try to defend or attempt to do more SCV damage with your drop than he does with his.

Finally, when your first Banshee starts its harass, you will get a good look at everything else your opponent is doing when trying to transition into the midgame. Keep an eye out for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either Marine/Tank or Mech play quite easily.

When transitioning into Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production early in order to have a safe defense and later strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use.
- Keep your eyes peeled for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop a drop or Banshee. Do NOT drop on top of an active Widow Mine.
- With your initial Widow Mine drop, avoid Turrets at all costs. The main purpose of the drop is to force multiple scans, with a side goal of dealing crippling economic damage.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that were already weakened by the initial drop before attacking any of the full health SCVs.
- If your opponent has a Missile Turret already set up in his mineral line, then do not worry. Instead, camping a Terrans production with a Widow Mine and several Marines can be just as effectiveespecially with the Banshee follow-up that hits soon after.
- Always favor keeping your Medivac and Banshee alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural. You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very strong, aggressive play style that opens up with unrelenting harassment before even entering the midgame. With a Widow Mine drop and Banshee follow-up, you can kill many SCVs and also force your opponent to scan often  giving you another type of economic advantage. Finally, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for opening with a 1/1/1 grants you the freedom to go into nearly anything.

However, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades. Also, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,Factory,Refinery,CallMule,SCV,Marine,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,Starport,WidowMine,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,WidowMine,Medivac,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnStarport,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,Banshee,CloakingField,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,Banshee,TechLabOnFactory,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:10 PM;

This 2 base, Hatchery-tech Roach-Speedling all-in crushes through Void Ray-less Stargate or heavy Gateway Protoss openers, both out of a Gateway Expand or Forge Fast Expand.

Scouting

Send your first Overlord to scout your opponent?s natural wall to spot for a Forge Fast Expand or Gateway Expand, and then send it to a safe area for a later 7:00 scout.  Consider using your 2nd Overlord to guard your natural expansion against Cannon Rushes. Your next Overlords can be placed around your opponent?s main or natural base as backup scouts or for vision of their 3rd base.
Use your initial Zerglings to scout around the map for Probes and proxy Pylons. Keep a Zergling outside his front to scout for any early pokes, and avoid any Stalkers or the Mothership Core whenever possible.
The majority of your scouting will come from the Roach/Ling all-in. Note whether or not your opponent has opened with a Stargate, Robotics Facility, or Gateway-heavy army, and react accordingly.

Transitions

This build is a 2 base Roach/Ling all-in off of only 27 Drones, so there is no well defined transition. That being said, if the attack is not going well, be sure to pull back and keep your units alive, instantly resume Droning, and attempt to secure a third base and 3rd Queen.  Going for Lair and Roach Speed or Hydralisks is probably your best way to defend the inevitable counter-attack, but you might be too far behind (based entirely on how much damage your all-in did) for it to be enough.

Tips

- Be active on the map with your initial few Zerglings in order to deny vision of the fact that you do not have a 3rd Hatchery (and especially that you have mined more than 100 gas just for Metabolic Boost).
- Roaches take up a lot of supply, so be sure to start several Overlords BEFORE you need to make the 8 Roaches.
- During the all-in, keeping up on your injects so that you have enough Speedling reinforcements could be the difference between a close game and an easy slaughter.

Pros and Cons

This is a very strong 2 base all-in that uses Roach/Ling to crush your opponent before the midgame has even started. It also requires little scouting and little APM to perform well, so it is a great build for newer players to perform as well.
However, if your opponent spots your lack of third base early on, they should have enough time to wall off their natural with Photon Cannons if they opened with a FFE or get out enough Sentries if they opened with a Gateway Expand.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Harstem 1 gate FE to Blink-Colossus', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a 1gate FE, and transitions directly into both Blink and Colossi. With these two tools you can safely secure your main and natural from both frontal pushes and backdoor drops.

Benchmark: When your first Colossus finishes (@9:00ish), you should have 1 Colossus, 3 Stalkers, a Sentry, a Mothership Core, 2 Observers, and around 50 Probes.

Scouting

This build is a safe build that gets detection and a lot of early game Stalkers, so Probe scouting is unnecessary. Use your initial Stalkers to ward off any of your opponents Reaper(s) or scout the front of your opponents base if they are opening with a Command Center First.

Most of your scouting will come from your 2 Observers. Send the first directly to your opponents main in order to spot what infrastructure is being built. Send the second to a common attack or drop path so that you have vision of when your opponent is moving out.

Against early Widow Mine drops, position your units defensively and consider delaying Colossus production in favor of more Observers.

Transitions

With Blink, Colossus, and Observers, you should be able to safely secure your main and natural expansions. Against bio play, consider getting 4 or 5 more Gateways while continuing your upgrades and taking your 3rd base as soon as you are safe to.

Alternatively, you are also able to go for a 2 Base, +2 Blink Stalker/Colossus all-in with this build.  Simply get your Ground Weapons upgrades instead of Ground Armor, and throw down 7 more Gateways after you start your Colossus production in order to break your opponent with simply Stalkers and Colossi.

Tips

- Chronoboost your Nexii constantly in order to get an economic advantage.
- Use your initial Stalker(s) to ward off any opposing Reapers and/or take a XelNaga Watchtower to see a push coming.
- Position your Robotics Facility, Forge, and Twilight Council in a central location to prevent them from being killed during a drop.
- Your Observers are the main way you can position your army to adequately defend multi-pronged aggression  replace them if they are scanned and lost.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with both Blink Stalkers and Colossi, rushing for all the tools you need to defend Terran aggression.  With strong upgrades and a mobile unit composition, this build allows you to enter the midgame ridiculously quickly.

However, with such investment in upgrades and tech, you have very little opportunity for aggression or much map control.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Nexus,MothershipCore,WarpgateUpgrade,Pylon,Assimilator,Probe,Stalker,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Stalker,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Observer,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Observer,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,RoboticsBay,Pylon,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,TwilightCouncil,Forge,Probe,WarpInSentry,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Blink,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,GroundArmorLevel1,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Pylon,ExtendedThermalLance,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Probe,Probe,Nexus,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:10 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Hero Aggresive Stargate', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Gateway Expand and then transitions into light Gateway pressure in order to start the macro game with an economic advantage. Also, this build gets both a Stargate and a third base quite quickly for a Chargelot/Void Ray or pure Sky-toss unit composition in the late game.

Scouting

After the early game, be sure to scout for early Roaches from your opponent. If your opponent is performing an early 2 base all-in, then warp-in Sentries and make Void Rays from your Stargate instead of being aggressive with your initial 6 units. If your opponent has taken a third base or shows NO signs of aggression, then be sure to set up your proxy Pylon as soon as you can for the attack to hit before Zergling Speed can finish.

When you are attacking with your initial 6 units (2 Stalkers, 3 Zealots, and Mothership Core), your opponent must defend with whatever units he has. With this extra scouting information, be sure to react appropriately. If your opponent has opened with Roaches, then be sure to start Void Ray production earlier. If your opponent has opened without Zergling speed, then be sure to continue the 3gate attack, reinforcing with Zealots and Stargate units when you can. If your opponent has opened with Zergling speed, then be sure not to over-commit to the attack; rather, pull back and start your Stargate production appropriately. Also note that if you kill a Queen or two, you should reinforce with an Oracle first due to your opponent?s lack of anti-air.

Depending on how your attack has gone (especially if your opponent defended with opening fast Roaches), then you might not feel safe to take such a quick third Nexus. Instead, start a Forge and a few Cannons at your natural in order to play safe.

Transitions

This build is a macro build, so don?t commit multiple warp-ins to the initial 3gate attack unless you are confident in its success. Following up with the appropriate Stargate units and taking your 3rd Nexus/extra Assimilators is much more important than dealing a killing blow with these units.

HerO follows up this attack with a Forge and several Cannons at both his natural expansion and 3rd Nexus. He then starts 2 more Stargates and both Assimilators at his 3rd Nexus in order to make a mass Void Ray army. With his economic advantage, he ensures that no standard Roach/Hydra timing attacks can kill his Sky-toss army until it is already too powerful.

However, it is also possible to play with an sOs style transition, favoring mass Chargelot and only several Void Rays in order to make a beefier ground army.  Again, start a Forge (or two) for Cannons at the natural expansion and 3rd Nexus as well as for Ground Upgrades. Then start at least 4 Gateways for a healthy Gateway count and a Twilight Council to begin Zealot Charge before taking your 5th and 6th Assimilators at your 3rd Nexus.  Add in High Templar/Archons instead of more Void Rays as your gas count allows it.

Tips

- Because this is a macro build with only light pressure, commit almost all of your chronoboost on both your Nexus throughout the build.
- With your initial Stalkers, be sure to clear any stray Zerglings around your base that might scout your build. Then defend the building proxy Pylon until your first warp-in.
- As soon as you start your Stargate, you need to send out a Probe in order to set up an aggressive proxy Pylon
- During your 3gate attack, use your Stalkers to target-fire any Queens your opponent might use to defend with. If you can kill a Queen or two, then follow-up with an Oracle to deal a lot of damage. Also, be sure to use Time Warp on any Queens or Roaches so as to minimize your opponent?s mobility in the fight.
- Do NOT over-commit multiple warp-ins to the 3gate attack unless you are confident that you can do damage. Each warp-in that you use slows down your 3rd Nexus timing by at least 20 seconds.
- If your opponent defends with fast Roaches, then consider starting a Forge and several Cannons at your natural expansion before you take the 3rd Nexus.

Pros and Cons

This macro build is strong because it opens with some light aggression for harassment and scouting, while taking a rather quick 3rd Nexus behind it. Also, it is a safe Gateway Expand build because your 3gates and Stargate together are enough to defend most early Zerg all-ins. Finally, this build uses a Stargate for some decent harassment, a deterrent for Mutalisks, and an opening for a strong unit-composition in the midgame.

However, this build requires solid macro while simultaneously performing a timing attack, so may be quite hard for newer players. Also, this build is somewhat weak against a Zerg who takes minimal losses during the 3gate attack and is able to follow-up with a +1/+1 mass Speedling attack to kill your 3rd Nexus.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Nexus,MothershipCore,WarpgateUpgrade,Pylon,Stalker,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Stalker,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Stargate,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Phoenix,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,VoidRay,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Nexus', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:10 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'HuK 5gate Warp Prism Attack', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with 2 Stalkers and a Mothership Core to take map control, and then follows up with a Warp Prism and 5 Gateways to drop the main of your opponent and force field him out of his own base.

Benchmark: When your Warp Prism finishes (@7:05ish), you should have around 32 Probes, 2 Stalkers, 4 Sentries, 1 Warp Prism, and a Mothership Core.

Scouting

This build is most effective against gasless openers from Terran, and quite ineffective against 1 base plays. Thus, be sure that you confirm your opponent doing a Reaper FE, CC First, or 1rax FE build with either your Probe scout at 13 supply or with your initial Stalker poke. If your opponent has not opened with an expansion, then abandon the Warp Prism and go instead for 2 more Assimilators, a Robotics Bay, double Forge, and standard macro PvT play. If your opponent has opened with an expansion, then proceed with this build and be sure to force field your opponent out of his main base.

Transitions

This build is a strong, 5 gate attack off of 2 bases with only 2 Assimilators.  Thus, you have to damage with this attack if you want to go into the midgame with an advantage. Assuming you do no damage and you lose the Warp Prism, you will have a very hard time coming back in the game, and should play stupidly greedy if you want a chance to come back. If you do some damage with this build but eventually lose everything, then you might still be in the game; transition by getting both Assimilators at your natural and go into a standard Colossi/Forge midgame. If you do a lot of damage and save some of your army with the Warp Prism, then you can feel free to take a greedy third base instantly while transitioning directly into Colossi+upgrades off of double Forge.

Tips

- Use your initial Stalkers and Mothership Core for map control and early game scouting. Only build the Warp Prism if you are playing against an expanding Terran. Get your naturals Assimilators and go into Colossi if you see your opponent staying on one base.
- Against Reaper play, keep at least one Stalker at home in order to defend your Probes and/or stop him from seeing your Warp Prism.
- When you finish your Warp Prism, load up your 4 Sentries instantly and head directly for your opponents main base.
- Poke your opponents front with your Stalkers before you go into the main with your Warp Prism to make sure that your opponent has all his units at his natural.
- Drop your Sentries on the high ground near your opponents ramp to instantly force field him out.
- Transform your Warp Prism into Phasing Mode and constantly warp-in 5 units at a time, favoring Zealots and Sentries.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with your Stalkers/Mothership Core to easily defend Reapers as well as take map control. Then, with the scouting intel that your Probe and Stalker poke give you, you follow up with a very early Warp Prism and 5 gate attack in order to drop in your opponents main while you force field him out. Against a non-expand build, you have the Robotics Facility and can get Observers or Immortals to play safe.

However, opening with this build delays your midgame tech by a lot. By only staying on 2 Assimilators, you do not have the gas income to go into Colossi instantly, and thus have to rely on your Warp Prism doing damage to get a leg up on your opponent. Also, this build relies a lot on early game scouting in order to ensure that your opponent is going for a standard expansion into Bio play.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,MothershipCore,Stalker,Chronoboost,Probe,Nexus,Probe,RoboticsFacility,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Chronoboost,WarpPrism,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpInSentry,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInSentry,WarpInSentry,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:10 PM;

This build opens with 5 Stalkers to apply pressure to your opponent and scout for what theyre opening.  It then follows up with a Stargate Expand, allowing you to reactively counter your opponents opening tech.

Benchmark: When you Stargate finishes (@6:30ish), you should have 24 Probes, 5 Stalkers, and a Mothership Core.

Scouting

Because of how low on minerals you are, you cannot afford to Probe scout.Thus, all of your scouting comes from your Stalkers.

Being active with your initial 3 Stalkers around your natural, third, and watchtower will prevent your opponent from sneaking proxy Pylons past you and hitting you with a very fast Gateway unit attack. Also, with your mobile army, you can head directly at your opponent in order to scout what units they have made and even attack them if they are attempting to expand quickly.  Your 5 Stalkers (with high ground vision from your Mothership Core) must scout what your opponent is doing, so that you can react accordingly with your Stargate in the midgame.

- If your opponent is fast expanding, then produce an Oracle from your Stargate and attempt to pressure the front with your Stalkers as your Oracle does damage in the main.
- If your opponent has multiple Sentries out, then attempt to bust up the ramp with your Stalkers to force him to use Force Fields to defend his ramp. The most likely scenario is that your opponent is making a Robotics Facility behind their Sentry count. However, it is also possible that your opponent is making a Stargate instead.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then make an Oracle or two and keep them in their base by threatening to kill multiple workers if they leave.
- If your opponent has a Stargate of their own, make constant Phoenix and position your units very defensively to deal with early Oracles.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then make one Oracle to stay defensive with in case of DTs. Afterwards, you can make up to 3-4 Phoenix for map control and harass potential, but quickly transition into Void Ray/Immortal to stay safe against Blink play.

Transitions

This build transitions into a macro game very easily. However, the actual unit composition of that macro game very often depends completely on what build your opponent has chosen to open with. If your opponent stays on one base for too long, then throw down more Gateways, constantly make units, and prepare to defend your natural with Void Rays, Stalkers, (possibly Immortals), and your Planetary Nexus. In Stargate vs Stargate macro games, quickly go up to 2 Stargates constantly making Phoenix and get a Fleet Beacon for the Phoenix Range upgrade. In Stargate vs Robotics macro games, use your Phoenix or Oracles to get an economic advantage, while transitioning into Sky-toss or a Phoenix/Blink all-in. In Stargate vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponents potential Blink or Dark Templar harass, as you transition to Void Ray/Immortal for defense or pure Sky-toss.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very safe build that gets quick map control with 5 Stalkers early on for safety, aggression, and scouting. With accurate scouting information, it then transitions into Stargate play and expands so that you can play a reactive macro game with a strong economy.

When you are out on the map with your first Stalkers, however, your opponent might sneak an Oracle into your main base. Be careful that you are only aggressive when you can be aggressive and only use your Stalkers for scouting when you cannot be aggressive.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'HyuN 12 Roach Opener', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This 12 Roach Rush is a timing attack designed to cripple a Terran economy, transitioning into a further all-in or macro play as needed.

Scouting

There is only minor scouting necessary with this build before you hit your opponent with your 12 Roaches. Simply ensure that your opponent is not cheesing you with an 8-8-8 opener or proxy 11/11 Rax.
Once you are committed in the attack, be on the look-out for signs that your opponent is going for a full-on macro play (3 Command Centers), some sort of Hellbat aggression (Armory), some sort of Banshee play (Techlabbed Starport), or normal Bio play (multiple Barracks). Your upcoming transition requires you to both do some damage and later handle any counter attack potential from your opponent without losing much yourself.

Transitions

Depending on what you are most comfortable with and what you scout your opponent doing, you can transition into a later all-in or macro play yourself. Note that regardless of whichever path you follow, you will have to do some amount of damage with your attack or you will be behind both in terms of economy and tech.
If you are transitioning into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk play, stop all Roach production, and get a Lair, Metabolic Boost, and 2 Evolution Chambers as soon as possible. Getting Mutalisks out to defend 3 bases from drops as you tech towards +2/+2 Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk with all the necessary upgrades is how you?ll get ahead in the midgame.
If you are transitioning into a Roach based midgame, try to avoid making many more Roaches after your initial 12 roach opener. Instead, focus on securing 3 Hatcheries, 2 Evolution Chambers, and teching for a Speed Roach/Speed Hydra midgame (with potentially Swarm Host/Viper lategame).
If you are transitioning into another all-in, your best best is some sort of Roach based army with splash damage (such as a Roach/Bane all-in). Do note that any follow-up all-in will be particularly weak against Banshee or Widow Mine defenses.

Tips

- As you get to your first 100 Gas, if there is still a scout in your main base, consider fake researching Metabolic Boost. Be sure to cancel if before you get to 28 supply and need to start your Roach Warren.
- Don?t over-commit to making Roaches. Only make 12 and then be sure you are getting the necessary 2 base economy, Overlord count, and creep spread back at home while your attack is commencing.
- The point of the attack is to cripple your opponent, but if the attack does not go too well, there is no retreat; your follow-up depends largely on your ability to scout what your opponent has opened with and react/defend accordingly.

Pros and Cons

This aggressive build can outright defeat opponents that are macroing too hard or do not scout and react adequately. Opening with 12 Roaches gives your early game a muscle that not many other ZvT builds give you, giving you great denial of any Reaper/Hellion openers as well.
However, this build does put you behind both in terms of economy and tech if your attack does not do damage.

Scouting

Scout with either Overlords, Zerglings, Overseer, or Changelings when your Hydralisk Den goes down. Send them into either the main base or the 3rd base in order to see if Protoss is going for a tech-heavy composition (Colossus/Void Ray/etc) or a Chargelot-heavy composition. If they are going for a Chargelot heavy composition, instantly throw down a Banelings Nest, start Baneling Speed, and max out with around 16 Banelings in your unit composition.
Besides this, all mid and late game scouting comes from the Roach/Hydra/Viper pokes or attacks that you will perform. React appropriately by either re-maxing with Ultras or Swarm Hosts. You will need a 5th base to fully support any Hive-tech re-maxes.

Transitions

There is no ?transition? per se. If you can win the game with this push, then be sure to attack in an open position, use Blinding Cloud or Abduct appropriately, and take the game quickly. If you cannot win the game outright, then fall back on your 4/5 base economy and tech switch to whatever best counters your opponent?s army. Note that you should get a lot of static defense in order to stay safe during your super late game tech switches between Mutalisks, Swarm Hosts, and Ultralisks.

Tips

- If your first Overlord scouts your opponent going for a Gateway expand, then you should abandon getting the third base, instead getting an Extractor and starting Metabolic Boost before taking your 3rd.
- If your natural gets Pylon blocked, then you can make an early Overlord at 15 supply instead of the Hatchery in order to buy some time against it. If your opponent lets the Pylon finish, then simply making 4-6 Zerglings to take the Pylon down should be enough of a commitment before returning back to the build.
- Being thorough about checking for early proxy Pylons across the map with your early game Zerglings is crucial against early Protoss timings. Being able to spot aggression and stop it before it can even begin is the easiest way to avoid quick losses.
- Be sure you send in an Overlord scout at 7:00. Spotting your opponent?s midgame tech informs your next step with this build(whether it be more Drones, a Hydralisk Den, or Spore Crawlers).
- Vipers will be usable (Consume finishes) 3:30 after your Infestation Pit starts.
- Scouting for a heavy Chargelot composition before you max can be quite important. Throwing down a Banelings Nest and maxing with several Banelings can be the difference between a quick loss and a sure win.
- Once you have re-maxed on Ultras, starting a Spire and tech-switching between Mutalisks and Swarm Hosts/Ultras is a strong way to win in the very late game. Also note that you should get a lot of static defense when performing these late game tech switches.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a hugely economic opening while still being safe. It then transitions into a Viper-based defense in order to secure your 4th base and quickly max out on Roach/Hydra/Viper.
This build however requires constant scouting in order to be safe. Also, it is not great against Skytoss unless you scout it early because you might over-produce Roaches (which obviously cannot shoot up) when gearing up for a normal attack.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Queen,Zergling,Drone,Drone,Queen,Hatchery,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Queen,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Overlord,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,RoachWarren,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Overlord,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,EvolutionChamber,Extractor,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Lair,Overlord,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Hatchery,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,MissleAttacksLevel1,MetabolicBoost,Extractor,Extractor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Overlord,InfestationPit,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Queen,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Hatchery,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Hive,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GlialReconstitution,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,HydraliskDen,MissleAttacksLevel2,Extractor,Extractor,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,MuscularAugments,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Viper,Viper,Viper,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,BanelingNest,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:11 PM;

Designed specifically to kill most Protoss players during the mid game Templar transition, INnoVations SCV pull hits at around 14 minutes with MMM, Vikings, SCVs, and 2/1 upgrades.

Scouting

The first ten minutes of the game is a standard TvP Reaper FE, so scouting and reactions proceed as normal.

First, SCV scout, 15 supply at the latest, to see if you are being 10 gate Zealot rushed. Then follow up with your Reaper scout, checking pylon count, assimilator count, gas mined, and MSC/Stalker/Nexus timing.

Your early Engineering Bay allows for equally early Missile Turrets, so you should be able to build a turret in your main base and position marines in your natural mineral line in the event of an Oracle attack.

Against a delayed Protoss expansion (4:10+, no Nexus), always build a bunker.

Against a fast expanding Protoss, poke with your first Marauder and 8-10 Marines to force overcharge and to gauge his army size.

This initial poke will reveal the following possibilities:

- Little to no Gateway units: Possible double forge (proceed as normal) or Dark Templars (build turrets and bank one scan minimum).
- No obvious Observers: Confirm Twilight tech. If your opponent is going for Templar instead of Colossus, immediately abandon the build and do a biomine parade style using a reactored Factory and five barracks before your third Command Center. SCV pulls are a poor choice against Pisonic Storm.
- More Stalkers then usual: Possible Blink Stalker aggression. React accordingly with bunkers and mines. Consider hiding your small poke squad at his third or fourth, and counter attacking when he moves all his stalkers and his MSC to your side of the map.
- Phoenixes: Phoenix Colossus is by far the most likely choice, but constantly scout to see if the Colossus count is rising. If it remains at one or two for very long, be cognizant of the possibility of a feint into Templars.
- Healthy Gateway unit count: Proceed as normal.

These above are only a few examples, but the most common. Against most styles that involve Colossus (single forge, double forge, blink colossus, phoenix colossus, etc) you will be able to simply play as normal and execute the all in without any problems.

For lower level players, please be advised all scouting reactions as written above are general assumptions made against players attempting optimal strategies. You will be blindsided by sub optimal and often illogical strategies quite often, but you should be able to compensate with superior macro and mechanics.

Transitions

As with any all-in, there is no transition unless you have done a significant amount of damage.

If your attack fails, there is no transition; you will die almost immediately to any counter attack, or you will be contained to two bases and slowly starve to death.

If your attack succeeds in mostly destroying Protosss army, but you cannot finish off your opponent, retreat and rally defensively. Continue your upgrades, maintain consistent worker production, and add a third command center and a Ghost Academy, if necessary.

Tips

The main objective of this push is to successfully engage and destroy his army decisively. Your SCVS are there to absorb just enough Colossus volleys to allow your Vikings to destroy all the AOE and your MMM to shoot through the Gateway buffer.

Again, to emphasize, your objective is to destroy his army decisively, not to destroy his third, or his natural, or snipe any tech. You are to take one crushing victory with your army before beginning to do any eco or tech damage.

During the actual engagement, be sure to have your SCVs in front of your main army. Attack in as wide of a concave as you can form, and make sure that your Vikings are shift A-clicked across his Colossus.

Do not attempt any drops or secondary attacks. Your attack needs to be as strong as possible along a single front for the highest chance of success.

Pros and Cons

The first ten minutes of this build, as mentioned above, are identical to a standard Reaper FE, making this a particularly tricky all in to scout. Additionally, this build has the benefit of blind countering some two base Colossus all-ins because it gets Vikings so quickly, and in such high numbers.

That being said, just as with any all-in, if scouted and identified, this build loses a lot of its potency. A faster than normal Templar transition and increased Sentries for force fields are both popular and effective responses against scouted SCV pulls.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,EngineeringBay,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,SCV,Barracks,SCV,DoubleMarines,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SCV,CallMule,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,TechLabOnBarracks,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,StimPack,Marauder,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,Factory,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marauder,CallMule,SCV,SCV,InfantryArmorLevel1,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Starport,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnFactory,DoubleMarines,Marauder,SCV,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SupplyDepot,Refinery,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,CombatShield,SupplyDepot,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMarines,CallMule,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,Armory,CallMule,Barracks,Barracks,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,ConcussiveShells,SCV,SCV,CallMule,TechLabOnBarracks,ReactorOnBarracks,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,InfantryWeaponsLevel2,SupplyDepot,CallMule,Marauder,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleVikings,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,Marauder,Starport,CallMule,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleVikings,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,CallMule,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Viking,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleVikings,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,CallMule,Marauder,Marauder,Viking,DoubleVikings', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:11 PM;

Then it follows up with a quick 3rd Command Center to get a leg up against a macro-oriented Protoss opponent.

Scouting

This macro build is a greedy build, so scouting for all-ins is important.  However, you cannot afford to (nor have any need to) scout with an SCV before 17 supply. When you get to your opponents base, check whether they have a natural expansion started at or before the 5 minute mark. If your opponent has not started a Nexus by around the 5 minute mark, and they have both gas geysers, then you can assume they are performing an all-in with either a Twilight Council or Stargate. Be prepared to delay your 3rd Command Center in favor of 2 more Bunkers at the front (or main if your opponent appears to be doing a Blink all-in) and/or a Turret per mineral line to deal with Oracles.

All of the midgame scouting will come from you pushing out and taking the middle watchtowers, attacking the front, and dropping the main once you have Medivacs out. Simply noticing what units and unit composition your opponent is using to defend should give you enough information about their midgame plans to make informed counters.

Transitions

Because of how much infrastructure and time has been spent on Bio play in this build, the only possible follow up is going for more Bio play and adding in Vikings+Ghosts (and Hellbats or Widow Mines for the late game) as you take more bases.

To transition into standard Bio play, get another Engineering Bay and an Armory to continue double upgrades, add-on a Reactor and Tech lab onto your 4th/5th Barracks, get all of your third bases Refineries, and throw down either a Ghost Academy or a 2nd Starport depending on whether your opponent is going for Colossi or High Templar.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong build because of the powerful economy you kick start with your initial CC First and quick third. Also, by avoiding early Widow Mine drops or harassing units and focusing completely on getting upgrades and Bio, your army is considerably stronger at the 10 minute mark than most other TvP builds. Finally, this build is strong because you get a fast Engineering Bay and excess minerals, and thus have the opportunity to throw down Bunkers/Turrets to deal with any sort of 1 base aggression that a Protoss player can throw at you.

However, this build is only safe if your scouting is effective. Misjudging that your opponent is going for a macro game instead of an all-in can cost you the game instantly. Also, there is no opportunity with this build to apply pressure before you finish Stim and Medivacs at the 10 minute mark because it is focused on economy instead of pressure.

Tips

- The main strength of this build is the economic advantage. Do NOT miss SCVs as you are taking bases and macroing up.
- You cannot afford to scout before 17 supply in order to afford the CC and Barracks on time, but scouting what your opponent is doing in the early game is crucial, so be sure to send an SCV to scout soon after you reach 17 supply.
- Build another Bunker or two at the front if a scan or your SCV scout finds that your opponent has not started an expansion around the 5 minute mark.
- If you are playing completely blind, build a Missile Turret in each mineral line to defend against the possibility of Oracles before they could possibly arrive.
- Once you have Stimpack and Medivacs, push out instantly to try and deny a third base from your opponent and/or get scouting information about what midgame tech choice your opponent is committing to. However, keep in mind that you are on 3 Orbitals, and so remember that your economy is far ahead, but your army supply is not.

This CC First build gets a ridiculously fast 3rd Command Center, taking your economy immediately into the midgame. Using Reactor Hellions for map control and scouting information, this build is also reasonably safe; your Hellions let you quickly react to any Zerg all-in and Widow Mines + 3 Orbitals provides a reasonable defense.

Scouting

Instead of worrying about early game Zerglings, Innovation just builds his Command Center on the high ground, and finishes a wall-off with the initial Barracks. Thus, Innovation does not scout at all until his first Hellions pop.  With these Reactor Hellions he takes map control, clears out any Zerglings at watchtowers, and pokes Zergs front to spot the Zergs third base, any buildings at the front, and any units that Zerg is making.

- If you see a ton of Speedlings, then make sure your Hellion micro is on point. Feel free to pull back behind your natural wall in order to more effectively deal with Speedlings.
- If you see Roaches, then immediately cut Reactor Hellion production and start making Widow Mines two at a time. Make a Marauder, and consider cutting SCVs in order to complete a wall-off at your natural and prevent your opponent from running past your Bunker/Widow Mines.
- If you see two Evolution Chambers, then assume your opponent is playing a macro game.
- Alternatively, if you see a third base, then you can also assume your opponent is playing a macro game.

After any early pressure is spotted or not spotted, lift off your third Command Center and take your third. Use your Hellions and Marines (now with Stim) to secure it. All mid-game scouting will come from your incoming push with your first Medivacs.

Transitions

This build transitions well into both Marine/Tank or Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine because it sets up the basic infrastructure needed for either of those and gets Stim, +1/+1, and Combat Shields. Its infeasible to transition into Mech because of how much infrastructure and time you have already committed to into Bio upgrades.

For either transition, secure your third base, take both Refineries at your third, start +2/+2, and produce a lot of Marines. When transitioning into Marine/Tank, start a Tech lab on your Factory as well as a second Factory to kick start your Siege Tank count. When transitioning into Bio/Widow Mine, produce a Reactor on your Factory and start cranking out Widow Mines as you abuse your mobile Marine/Medivac force to apply pressure to your opponent. A +2/+2 timing attack with several Siege Tanks or several Widow Mines, and a lot of Marines is a very strong timing to hit.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a ridiculously economic opener  CC First into 3 CC.  However, this build gets Reactored Hellions quite quickly in order to take map control as well as stay safe against early Speedling timings. Also, your Hellions are quite useful in terms of the scouting information they give you.

However, this build is somewhat weak to early Roaches. Also, you can only apply very light pressure to your opponent with your initial 6 Hellions  all other harass will have to come later once Medivacs are out.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Bunker,Marine,CallMule,SCV,Factory,CallMule,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,SCV,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,SCV,StimPack,Marine,CallMule,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SCV,EngineeringBay,EngineeringBay,DoubleHellions,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,SCV,SCV,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,InfantryArmorLevel1,Marine,LiftFactoryFromReactor,ReactorOnFactory,Barracks,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SupplyDepot,CallMule,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,LandRaxOnReactor,DoubleMarines,SCV,LandRaxOnReactor,DoubleMarines,Marine,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Armory,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marine,CombatShield,CallMule,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SCV,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marine,ReactorOnFactory,ReactorOnBarracks,TechLabOnBarracks,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SCV', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:11 PM;

This 3 Hatchery opening transitions into a strong Speedling/Hydralisk timing to hit the third base of Protoss before its economy can kick in. It then tech switches instantly into Spire or Roach/Hydra/Viper play to best counter the unit composition Protoss has used to defend the pressure.

Scouting

Once you are into the midgame, all of your scouting will come from what your opponent hits you with, and then later your Ling/Hydra timing attack. Assuming your opponent has opened with Stargate play, you will either see Phoenix harassing your Overlords/Drones or a Void Ray for defense while your opponent tries to take a third. As soon as you have confirmed your opponent going for Stargate play (either with an early Overlord scout or by any of the above cues), you can choose to go through with this build.
When you are attacking your opponent?s third base with your Ling/Hydra timing, be sure to note your opponent?s unit composition. Against Colossus play, throw down a Spire. Against Stargate play, keep making Hydralisks. Against Blink play or a strong ground army, transition into Roach/Hydra/Viper play or continue with a Ling/Hydra unit composition and +2/+2 upgrades.

Transitions

This build is designed to tech switch as soon as you spot the unit composition of your opponent, so it has quite a few transitions. In all cases, as you are moving out with the Ling/Hydra timing attack, be sure to start your 4th Hatchery.
If your Ling/Hydra timing runs into a Colossus, start a Spire and take 2 more Extractors at your 4th Hatchery. Go for a hard Mutalisk switch to catch your opponent off-guard and keep applying pressure/harassing your opponent?s Probes, while you take the map and transition into the late game. Killing off any Phoenix during your Ling/Hydra timing will strengthen this transition dramatically. Going for a Hive instantly and getting Vipers can be strong against Colossus play too.
If your Ling/Hydra timing runs into a Chargelot/Void Ray or pure Skytoss unit composition, then be sure to keep making Drones and out-expand your opponent OR keep committing to the fight by rallying more and more Hydralisks and Speedlings in an attempt to break your opponent. If you choose to macro and out-expand your opponent, a Roach/Hydra/Viper unit composition with 2 Evolution Chambers is quite standard ? so start +2/+2 Missile upgrades and Hive tech as soon as you can.

Tips

- If your first Overlord scouts your opponent going for a Gateway expand, then you should abandon getting the third base, instead getting an Extractor and starting Metabolic Boost before taking your 3rd.
- Also, if you feel unsafe opening with a Hatchery First against a Forge First Fast Expand, then feel free to open with a Pool First into 3 Hatchery Opener and transition into this build in exactly the same manner.
- If your natural gets Pylon blocked, then you can make an early Overlord at 15 supply instead of the Hatchery in order to buy some time against it. If your opponent lets the Pylon finish, then simply making 4-6 Zerglings to take the Pylon down should be enough of a commitment before returning back to the build.
- Being thorough about checking for early proxy Pylons across the map with your early game Zerglings is crucial against early Protoss timings. Being able to spot aggression and stop it before it can even begin is the easiest way to avoid quick losses.
- There is no need for a Roach Warren if you spot your opponent going for a Forge Fast Expand into Phoenix build, as Jaedong scouts when beating Dear at the WCS Finals.
- During the Ling/Hydra timing, be sure not to fight in a choke where force fields will split your Zerglings from Hydralisks.
- During the Ling/Hydra timing, spread your army to help reduce Colossus splash damage. Target firing any Colossus or getting on top of the Robotics Facility is a great way to perform game-ending damage.
- Start your 4th Hatchery before the fight so that your transition is backed with maximal economy.  Perform the tech switch reacting to your opponent?s unit composition as soon as you can.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a hugely economic opening in order to fund a 3 Base Ling/Hydra timing to crush your opponent?s 3rd Nexus. It also does not commit much to the attack, allowing you to tech switch instantly and counter the unit composition your opponent has chosen to defend their third with.
However, this build is weak to early pressure, for you skip the Roach Warren for safety against early 2 base Protoss attacks. Also, because this build opens with a gasless 3 Hatchery opener, you should only be performing this build against Forge Fast Expanding players.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Queen,Zergling,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Queen,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,MetabolicBoost,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Drone,EvolutionChamber,EvolutionChamber,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,MeleeAttacksLevel1,MissleAttacksLevel1,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Lair,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,SporeCrawler,SporeCrawler,SporeCrawler,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,HydraliskDen,HydraliskDen,Overseer,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GroovedSpines,MuscularAugments,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,InjectLarva,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hatchery,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:11 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'INnoVation Reaper-Hellion 3CC', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

Invented by Flash but refined and popularized by INnoVation, this Reaper/Hellion 3CC variant is by far the most popular on ladder and is considered by the majority of Terran players to be the most standard of macro builds. Its versatility has stood the test of time, and the current version below will be continually updated as INnoVation continues to optimize it again and again.

Scouting

You can open with this build regardless of what your opponent is doing, so SCV scouting is unnecessary. You only need to SCV scout if you want to confirm that your opponent is opening Hatchery First and want to start a Bunker at their natural in order to begin Reaper/Bunker pressure.

The rest of your scouting will come from your Reapers and then later Reaper+Hellions poking the front and forcing your opponent to reveal what units they have in order to defend your attacks. Note: Ling Speed will finish around 3 minutes after your opponent takes an Extractor. Thus, if your initial SCV/Reapers see your opponent taking gas, be sure to send your Reapers back just before those 3 minutes are up and wait for some Hellions before attempting to engage Speedlings in the open field.

In case your Reapers or Hellions spot your opponent making Roaches or going for a Roach Warren, immediately cancel your next pair of Hellions and begin making Widow Mines and Marauders. Having your Widow Mines positioned effectively, and using SCVs to tank damage or repair your Bunker will be all you need to stay alive.

Be prepared to throw the timings of the second half of this build out assuming any serious aggression, such as a Roach Bane all-in.

Transitions

This build transitions well into both Marine/Tank or Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine because it sets up the basic infrastructure needed for either of those and gets Stimpack.

The above transition involving double barracks after hellions followed by double ebay is the standard transition. In the event of an extreme all in, such as Roach bane, immediately begin marauder, mine, and bunker production. Against a strong Roach timing it is advised to begin tank production while slightly delaying either your Starport or Engineering Bays; this is most demonstrated notably in INnoVations series against Hyun in the WCS 2014 Global Finals.

Another great transition if you have done some damage with your Reapers or Hellions is going for a Hellbat/Marauder follow-up attack. How Dragon does this is throw down an Armory as soon as you start your 3rd Command Center, and then make Hellbats constantly as soon as the Armory finishes.  Starting two Engineering Bays and going for a +1/+1 Marauder/Hellbat push is a great way to keep up the aggression against your Zerg opponent. Keep in mind that this sort of 3CC Hellbat aggression is far weaker than a two base committed Hellbat push.

Pros and Cons

This build was originally intended as an aggressive opener backed by strong macro. In modern TvZ, however, any competent Zerg player will easily deflect Reaper Hellion pressure with minimal losses, and gasless three hatches are becoming increasingly rare due to the benefits provided by opening either Speedlings or Roach aggression. As such, the major pro of this build should now be listed as the amount of information that the Reaper can provide; because Zerg cannot proxy any tech, you should be aware of what Zerg is doing most of the time. In this way, opening Reaper/Hellion is inordinately safer than simply opening Hellions, if only because of the information difference.

The weakness of this build traditionally had been hyper aggressive openers, such as fast Speedling rushes (which can be deterred by bunkers between your 2nd CC and your main ramp), Roach/Bane busts (which can be held with bunkers, repair, and either mines or hellions with Marauders), or even fast Muta play (which INnoVation countered by simply pushing at his normal time with three missile turrets at home).

The new biggest threat against this build, however, is Roach timings. Simply put, this build focuses very heavily on Hellion production, and delays all other AOE quite significantly (usually up until around 11+ minutes). As such, 1-1 Roach Busts, or fast 2-2 Roach Hydra max out attacks, or even Roach Hydra into Brood Lords are all excellent examples of builds in which players should quickly identify, cut Hellions, and immediately begin adapting their builds for the situation.

Learning this Build and the Difficulty Curve

This build is undoubtedly one of the hardest macro builds to learn in the game. Besides its extreme adherence to timings and linear sequences, it is also extremely punishing in every aspect; INnoVation has refined this build to the point of impracticability; over queueing means delaying Hellions; delaying Hellions delays your Barracks, delaying your Barracks delays your starport, and delaying your starport delays your entire 1-1 push. In short, a single mistake has many more long lasting impacts as opposed to a standard Terran build.

To go about learning this build, it is important to work on only one section at a time and to not try to do everything at once when you first start off, else you will immediately fail.

In the order of things to focus on (#1 being top priority, and #8 being the lowest priority)

1. Worker Production
2. Not getting supply blocked, not over queueing, and proper rallies for all structures
3. The build itself (for example, starting Hellions before 5:30, or double E-bay and 2nd gas geyser at 7:40) and its relevant timings
4. Taking your Third base on time
5. Scouting
6. Keeping your Reaper Hellion alive
7. Harassing
8. Micro (Sniping the first creep tumor, catching the transfer of drones to the third base, weakening Queens to force transfuses and decrease tumors, sniping active tumors, runbys, etc.)

In short, always defer to the priorities, and only move down the line as you can accomplish the others. Even if you kill 32 Zerglings with your Hellions, it is irrelevant if you Medivacs finish at 12 minutes instead of 10:20. Even if you land your third base at 8:30, it is irrelevant if you only have 26 SCVs at the time instead of 40-50 that INnoVation might have. And even if you plant every structure down perfectly at the allotted times, supply blocks, over queueing, poor rallies, and suboptimal worker distribution also grind this entire build to a screeching halt.

Focus on one step at a time, and continually re watch INnoVations replays of this build from his view to fully internalize the mechanics and decisions that make this build brilliant.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,Reaper,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,CommandCenter,GasScv,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Factory,SCV,SCV,CallMule,CommandCenter,SCV,LiftRaxFromReactor,OrbitalCommand,LandFactoryOnReactor,Marine,SCV,DoubleHellions,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleHellions,StimPack,Marine,SCV,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,DoubleHellions,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnFactory,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,EngineeringBay,EngineeringBay,Refinery,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Marine,SCV,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,InfantryArmorLevel1,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,SCV,SCV,SCV,LandRaxOnReactor,LandRaxOnReactor,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Refinery,Refinery,ReactorOnFactory,Starport,SCV,SCV,SCV,CallMule,CallMule,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,ConcussiveShells,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,Armory,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Refinery', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:11 PM;

This all-in hits your opponent?s main with a lot of speed Roaches. However, Jaedong puts his own clever flair on this traditional ZvT All-in by using an Overlord Roach Drop to guarantee his Nydus follow-up is successful.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of very early force, position your Queens to defend your natural and consider getting a Spine Crawler. Banshee play may be an issue with only 2 Queens, but such a fast Lair means you will have a very quick Overseer.
The next scout will be with your initial Roach Warren attack. Terran will be forced to defend his main with all his units, so you?ll see either Bio or Mech units to defend. These Roaches should be able to scout and do some serious economic damage ? hopefully enough to end the game with constant reinforcements from the Nydus Network.

Transitions

This build is a 2 base all-in that gets a lot of attacking units and very few Drones as well as upgrades that do not lend themselves towards the mid or late game. Therefore, there is no well-defined follow-up for the build, should your attack fail. However, if you do a lot of damage with the attack but lose your Nydus Network, be sure to follow-up with a 3rd Hatchery, a lot more Drones, and 2 Evolution Chambers to try to transition into normal play.

Tips

- Against a Reaper/Hellion player, save your Queen energy after you start 2 or 3 Creep Tumors. Having energy for Transfuse lets you push back any early attacks without revealing your Roaches.
- Hide your Roaches for as long as possible before you move out. The less time you give your opponent to react to your build, the better your chance at crushing through their front.
- Make 2 Overlords per inject cycle ? 8 Roaches takes up 16 supply.
- Bring an Overseer or two with your Roach attack so that you have detection against Widow Mines. Remember to split your Roaches to avoid splash damage from either Widow Mines or Siege Tanks.
- This attack is an all-in, so you have to kill your opponent with this attack. Don?t let your Roaches mess around attacking buildings or SCVs ? kill your opponent?s army as soon as possible.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any player going for a fast 3 Command Center build (the current metagame) because of how late their upgrades and army will be. Also, any build that gets both Roach drops AND Nydus Networks is a very fun all-in to play with.
However, this is an all-in, so if you cannot do game-ending damage with the Roach attack, you will be economically behind the Terran opponent.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,MetabolicBoost,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Overlord,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Lair,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,RoachWarren,Drone,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,VentralSacs,Overlord,Overlord,GlialReconstitution,PneumatizedCarapace,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,NydusNetwork,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,NydusWorm', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:11 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Jaedong 9 Pool', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a 9 Pool in order to apply a lot of early pressure to your opponent and keep them on one base, and then transitions into more macro oriented play with a Speedling follow-up.

Scouting

All of your scouting comes from your initial Overlords and your 10 Zerglings.  First scout where your opponent has spawned by sending your Overlord directly to one of the possible bases. Then use your first 6 Zerglings (with more rallied) to poke/prod your opponent?s base.
If you see your opponent?s natural Hatchery nearly done, then they have performed a Hatchery First opener and you can choose either to ignore the natural and attack their workers in the main or to focus exclusively on the natural and plan to bring it down. Note that you MUST do economic damage one way or another with your 10 Zerglings or you will fall behind economically.
If your opponent?s natural Hatchery is only just started, then they have performed a Pool First opener. Focus on canceling the natural Hatchery ? you won?t be able to do much damage in the main before their Spawning Pool finishes.
If your opponent does not have a natural, then go up into the main and check their gas count. Prepare against 1 base play of either Banelings or Roaches by focusing much more on Speedlings and potentially getting a Spine Crawler.

Transitions

You can use this opener to transition into any form of Zerg play. If you want to end the game immediately, you can put Drones back on gas and go for a 1 base Ling/Bane all-in.
More standard play ensues by starting your natural expansion as soon as possible and making only as many Speedlings as needed to be safe and have map control. For a Roach midgame, start a Roach Warren and Lair after your first 100 gas. Then, on 3 gasses, you can start Roach Speed and +1 Attack. For a Mutalisk midgame, get a Lair with your first 100 gas and saturate your 2 bases and 4 gasses as soon as possible. Start your Spire as soon as your Lair finishes.

Tips

- Attack his Drones in his main if he has performed a Hatchery First opener
- Attack his natural expansion if he has gone for a Pool First opener
- Scout his main if he has gone for a 1 base build
- Do NOT make too many Zerglings. It may seem tempting to try and kill your opponent with constant reinforcements, but slow Zerglings lose their effectiveness very quickly. Drones are much more important.
- Be sure to pull off of gas once you have mined 100 for Metabolic Boost. You need all of your Drones mining minerals in order to boost your economy into the midgame.

Pros and Cons

This build opens up with a 9 Pool in order to situate aggressively in a matchup known for its early game volatility. It also gets Metabolic Boost at a standard time, while still allowing for both macro or all-in transitions.
However, this build is obviously a lot less economical than most other ZvZ builds, so you must do some sort of economic damage with your initial 10 Zerglings or risk falling behind.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,CancelExtractor,Drone,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Queen,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,MetabolicBoost,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Overlord,InjectLarva', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:11 PM;

Scouting

Feel free to Probe scout after you build your Gateway in order to determine what your opponent is building. The majority of information about what Terran is doing however will come from what your opponent hits you with.  If you spot a Reaper coming into your base, then try and stop it from seeing your building Stargate with your Stalker and Mothership Core (do not worry too much if it is spotted however, for your Stargate is only initially being used for one Oracle). If you do not spot a Reaper, then send your Mothership Core and use its huge sight range to spot what buildings your opponent has inside of his base before returning home.

The majority of your midgame scouting will come from your Oracle. Use it to spot whether your opponent is opening with Bio, going for fast upgrades, fast triple Command Center, or strong 2 base timing. If you see an opening, then the Oracle can be used to harass your opponents SCVs, but the true purpose of the Oracle is constant scouting through the midgame. Your opponents 3rd base timing is especially useful as a good benchmark for when you should try and take your 3rd base.

Transitions

The build transitions into a Phoenix/Colossus midgame, with a standard Colossus/High Templar/Archon late game. As soon as you spot your opponent taking his 3rd base, secure a third of your own, then start 2 Forges and several more Gateways. Keep producing Phoenix and Colossus until you have around 7 of each (7 is a LOT for a normal game, but the heavily delayed High Templar tech means that you have a stronger army in the midgame), supplementing your army with Zealots when you have extra minerals. Finally, when your +1/+1 is halfway done, be sure to start a Twilight Council for +2/+2, Zealot Charge, and Templar Archives in order to reach your lategame army.

Tips

- In the early game, you are attempting to get your economy up enough to support Phoenix/Colossus on 2 bases.  Be sure to chronoboost your Probes constantly until you need to divert chronoboost to your Robotics Facility/Stargate.
- Against Reaper play, position your initial Stalker and Mothership Core defensively.  Try to deny it scouting your Stargate, but dont worry if it is scoutedthe Stargate is only initially used for one Oracle.
- The main purpose of your initial Oracle is for scouting. While it is true that you can kill several SCVs if your opponents Marines are out of position, do NOT sacrifice your Oracle for a few extra kills. The constant threat of harass and ability to scout for the first 10 minutes of the game is a lot more important than an extra SCV kill or two.
- Position your Phoenix defensively outside your main (to absolutely shut down any midgame drops) up until you are ready to take your third.  If/when your Oracle dies, use your flock of Phoenix to take map control and kill several SCVs with any extra APM you have.
- Take your third base and start 2 Forges as soon as you spot your opponent taking his 3rd base.
- Build more Colossus (up to 7) than you normally would (around 4). With the extra air support tanking and killing Vikings, your Colossus count must be quite large in order to take out your opponents Bio army.

Pros and Cons

This build gets out an early Oracle for harass potential and constant scouting. It also gets a strong economy and uses a midgame Phoenix/Colossus unit composition to defend drops and bio pushes with ease. This midgame composition is quite robust in terms of defending your third as well as stopping constant Medivac harass.

However, this build is short on Gateway units for the early stages of the game. Thus, any early drops are quite hard to stop unless you are able to scout them beforehand and prepare appropriately. Also, you do not start your Forges until you start your third base, so you will often be behind in upgrades against a macro-Terran.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,MothershipCore,Nexus,GasProbe,GasProbe,WarpgateUpgrade,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,Probe,Stargate,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Probe,Oracle,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Observer,RoboticsBay,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Observer,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,ExtendedThermalLance,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Phoenix,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Phoenix,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Phoenix,Chronoboost', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:11 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Leenock 3 Base Ultra', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with fast upgrades and mass Speedlings to crush any midgame attacks. It then transitions into a strong 3 base Ultralisk timing to either cripple the Protoss opponent or outright win the game.

Scouting

Scout first with your 2 initial Zerglings, use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of the Protoss base depending on the map.   Check to see whether your opponent is Gateway expanding or Forge expanding. Be wary of early pressure if your opponent is Gateway expanding.
With your 7:00 overlord scout, consider adding a Baneling Nest if you are up against a Gateway timing. Make mass Speedlings to defend any 2 base ground plays or ramp up Queen production early to defend any 2 base air plays.
Against a 2 base Colossus push, consider adding a Spire for Corruptors if you need more defense. Also, regardless of whether or not you need to make Corruptors for defense, you should start Air upgrades in case of a Mutalisk switch after you have maxed out with your Ultralisk army.
Ideally, your Ultras should be out with +5/+3 around 15:50. Commit to an attack as soon as possible when these upgrades finish.  If you have yet to take a 4th base and Spire or Hydralisk Den by this stage in the game, get them now.

Transitions

There is no ?transition? per se.  If you can win the game with this push, then be sure to attack in an open position and take the game quickly. If you cannot win the game outright, then fall back on your 4 base economy and tech switch to whatever best counters your opponent?s army.

Tips

Against Pylon blocks

- If you want to try and guarantee the Hatchery being placed, send a Drone to your natural around 11/12 supply and hide it there. This might trick Protoss into thinking that you are going Pool first.  Note that this will not work every time, and it also will not stop a Protoss dedicated to Pylon blocking you.
- A 15 Pool/15 Hatch/15 Gas opener (or at worst ? if they fail to cancel the Pylon ? a 15 Pool/15 Gas/and Hatchery as soon as you can) will be fine in this case. The most important thing is starting your Extractor on time, not the natural Hatchery.
- Be sure to make 4-6 Zerglings to take the pylon down if you need to, and go up to 3 Queens as soon as you can ? just like normal.
- Once you place your Extractor, the first 100 gas goes to Metabolic Boost, and place your Evolution Chambers when you get to 175 gas like normal to transition back into the build.

The Engagement

- Bring your Queens to transfuse, and any optional Infestors or Banelings you made to force good engagements.
- Do NOT engage into a Protoss wall. You want to engage in as open an area as you possibly can for your melee army to do maximum damage.
- Do NOT engage without your queens in transfuse range unless you are sure you can take a strong fight. Strong creep spread with all of your Queens helps tremendously.
- Try to avoid Archons with your Zerglings; use the Ultralisks to tank those. Similarly, focus your Zerglings on Stalkers and Immortals; keep your Ultralisks away from those.
- If you use Ultralisks to crush any forcefields, Zerglings can actually deal with Colossi quite easily as they take minimal damage whilst underneath the Colossi.

Pros and Cons

This build is very strong against a ?standard? Protoss army of Gateway units, Colossi and some Stargate or Templar units. Also, this timing attack has the strong potential to end the game.
However, this build is somewhat simple for Protoss to scout and is vulnerable to timing attacks and all-ins when you only have upgraded Speedlings to defend.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Life Baneling Bust', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a quick 3 Hatcheries, faking as if you are going for a macro-oriented play, but then builds an overwhelmingly large swell of Zerglings and Baneling busts your opponent before they are ready.

Scouting

Use your initial 2 Zerglings to probe the front of your opponent?s natural. Assuming they don?t die, send them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or outside the front of the Terran?s base depending on the map.
Your next scout will be with your Baneling bust. Based off of how strong your opponent?s wall is, what unit composition he is using to defend, and how many SCVs you kill, react accordingly.

Transitions

While technically this build gets a third base, you are on a very low Drone count, and are spending all of your money on an early all-in that absolutely has to deal some amount of economic damage. Usually the only viable follow-up is sending wave after wave of Zerglings and Banelings in order to finish off your opponent, but if Terran has pushed you back or  over-committed to a strong wall-off, just pull back and Drone at home. Transition into standard Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk play if possible.

Tips

- While Life opens with a 15 Spawning Pool, you can perform this same build by opening with a 15 Hatchery as well.
- Hide your 2nd Extractor and Banelings Nest from areas where your opponent is likely to scout with a Reaper or Hellion.
- Morph your Banelings out of sight of your opponent?s wall-off, so your opponent does not know that you are about to hit him until your Baneling bust is already happening.
- Be sure to send your Banelings in to target down any Bunkers or Supply Depots in the wall first and then flood in with the rest of your Zerglings.
- Most of your initial army will likely die. The true win happens from your rallied army and any more Banelings you morph from it.

Pros and Cons

This build hits an early 2 Base timing when your opponent is less likely to be expecting any pressure, let alone a strong all-in. Without a strong wall-off or excellent micro, it will walk over most unsuspecting Terran players.
However, this build sacrifices a lot of economy and tech in order to fund such a huge army.

This build opens up with a quick 3 base economy to stay safe against any early Terran shenanigans as well as give you enough power to hit a strong Zergling/Baneling timing before your Terran opponent can get their 3 base economy rolling. One main strength of this build is that the timing push is not all-in, but rather a tool to get you safely to the familiar position of Mutalisks and 4 bases without having to deal with unrelenting Terran pressure.

Scouting

Note the 7:00 Overlord scout to check whether your opponent is going for Bio or Mech. Do not continue with this build order if your Overlord scout spots your opponent going for Mech.
If you scout a Reaper/Hellion/Banshee opener, keeping your Queens alive without Metabolic Boost is quite difficult. Instead of blindly rushing into this build, get a few Spine Crawlers and 1 Spore Crawler per mineral line with an extra Spore or two between the natural and 3rd Hatchery.  It is fine to commit a lot to defense in this situation as going Reaper/Hellion/Banshee slows down any Bio/Mine pushes considerably.
By the time you attack just after 11 minutes, you must know how Terran is going to defend. Run a Zergling or two at Terran?s wall where you want to bust through to spot what army composition is waiting.
- If you scout Bio/Mine, continue as normal with the initial bust.
- If you scout Marine/Tank, consider continuing the bust. However, if you see more than one Siege Tank, be sure to retreat and build your Spire/Creep/Hive!
- If you scout Mech this late, you have most likely already lost. Transitioning into Mutalisks or Swarm Hosts instantly may be enough to keep you alive, but know that you have committed a lot of resources to a bust that cannot succeed.

Transitions

Once you perform the bust, you will either outright win the game, do a little bit of economic damage and trade armies, or completely fail without doing any serious damage. In either of the first two cases, continue to deny the most recent Terran base (either an undefended 3rd, or a future 4th if their 3rd is well established), and continue to play the macro game. If your bust has completely failed, then you can attempt to play the macro game with your 5 Hatcheries already done, but note that you have committed and subsequently a lost of resources going into the macro game.
In a macro game, go up to Hive tech when you most prefer. Some Zergs delay it, some get it faster. Life is known for getting it for +3/+3 and faster Ultralisks. Eventually transitioning into Ultralisk/Queen/Infestor is a solid end-game unit composition ? just be sure that you have enough static defense to deny doom drops and stop Terran from spreading you too thin as you attempt to create this scary army.

Tips

- Against any early pressure, your Queens and a Spine Crawler are all the defense you will need.  With a later Metabolic Boost, you cannot rely on Speedlings to help defend any 1 base all-ins.
- Do your best to clear the map of any of your opponent?s Hellions BEFORE you are ready to bust. Being able to spawn your Banelings close to your opponent as opposed to back at your base makes this bust a lot more effective.
- Get an Overseer before the initial bust to help clear any Widow Mines. However, this build hits early enough that there should not be too many Widow Mines up just yet for you to worry about.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any player going for a Tank-less 3 Command Center build (the current metagame). Also, because you saturate your third base before moving out, it is quite easy to stop Zergling/Baneling production and transition into a macro game with a strong economic advantage.
However, this build sacrifices quick Mutalisks in lieu of more Zerglings and Banelings, so early drops can be a problem.

This build is a fast expand build that opens with a Mothership Core for defense, and then follows-up with a very quick 5gate timing with Zealots and Sentries to crush your opponent before they can even enter their midgame tech.

Scouting

After the early game, scouting is much more minimal than you might expect. As long as you can confirm your opponent is getting a third Hatchery (and sometimes even if they are not getting one), you should be able to go through with this build.

With your attack, you will be able to scout what units he is using to defend. If you are fighting mass Speedling, then constantly warp-in Zealots and Sentries.  If you are fighting Roaches, then constantly warp-in Stalkers. Your opponent should not be able to get out either Hydras or Mutalisks in time to defend this attack.

Transitions

If it appears that your opponent has way over-committed to defending your attack with units or Spine Crawlers, you can always retreat and go for the macro game. Either force field your opponent back and walk home or mass recall your army to your natural Nexus. A common follow-up to this build is starting a Robotics Facility and going for Colossi to deal with your opponent?s Roaches. Alternatively, you can go for a Stargate and make Phoenix in order to prepare for your opponent?s Mutalisks. Be sure to use Hallucinations often to check-up on what midgame tech your opponent is going for. Take a third base when you feel safe.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a Gateway expand, so your 5gate attack will hit very soon (before 7 minutes). This build usually hits your opponent before they have any midgame tech.

However, this build relies on you deflecting your opponent?s scouting information in order for it to be maximally effective.

This CC First build takes your economy immediately into the midgame and then transitions into a 9 minute, 2 base Marine/Hellion/Medivac timing with Stimpack.

Scouting

Build the Command Center on the high ground and then wall-off with your initial Barracks. This way, you will not have to worry about early Zerglings because you will have a full wall. Thus, SCV scouting is no longer necessary.

Your first scouting comes from the first Hellions you make. With these Reactor Hellions, you can take map control, clears out any Zerglings at watchtowers, and pokes Zergs front to spot the Zergs third base, any buildings at the front, and any units that Zerg is making.

If you see a ton of Speedlings, then make sure your Hellion micro is on point. Feel free to pull back behind your natural wall in order to more effectively deal with Speedlings.

If you see Roaches, then immediately cut Reactor Hellion production and start making Widow Mines two at a time. Delay your Starport for a little while in order to afford Marauders, and consider cutting SCVs in order to complete a wall-off at your natural and prevent your opponent from running past your Bunker/Widow Mines.

If you see two Evolution Chambers, then assume your opponent is playing a macro game.

Alternatively, if you see a third base, then you can also assume your opponent is playing a macro game.

Transitions

This build transitions pretty normally into standard Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine play as well as Marine/Tank/Medivac play in a pretty common manner. However, because of the resources and time you have devoted to Bio units and upgrades, this build cannot transition into Mech.

For either the Bio/Mine or Marine/Tank transition, as you are pushing out, instantly start your 3rd Command Center, Combat Shields, and 2 Engineering Bays. It is also strongly suggested that you continue Medivac and Marine production before adding on more Barracks so that you can continue unrelenting drop play and keep your opponent on their half of the map while you are attempting to take your own third and get into your comfortable late-game infrastructure. When your Engineering Bays finish, be sure to start your Infantry upgrades, all of your Refineries, and throw down up to 5 more Barracks to be able to pump out your 3 base army.

If you are going for Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine play, be sure to start a Reactor on your naked Factory and start Widow Mine production (adding a 2nd Factory with a Tech lab for the Widow Mine upgrade once you have later secured your third).

If you are going for a Marine/Tank/Medivac play, be sure to start a Tech lab on your naked Factory and start Siege Tank production (adding a 2nd Factory with a Tech lab once you have later secured your third).

Tips

- Do NOT over commit with your initial Hellions. Use them exclusively for scouting purposes in the early game; their true purpose is to bolster your ground army in the actual Marine/Hellion/Medivac timing attack.
- Against any all-ins with this build, you must rely on your Bunker placement, SCV control, and scouting it coming. Be active on the map with your first Hellions so that you know what is coming your way before it gets to your doorstep.
- Feel free to push out with your Bio army even before Stimpack/Medivacs are even done. As long as you have Hellions scouting in front to ensure you are not being all-inned, your Bio army can be walking across the map while your Medivacs boost in behind them so that you hit your opponent the second Stimpack finishes.
- Do NOT clump up against Banelings. Your opponent should not be able to have that many Banelings by the 9 minute attack, but be sure to spread your army and micro appropriately if you see Banelings on the field.
- Remember to pick up your Marines into the Medivacs and boost away as soon as your army is finally overtaken. Keeping your opponent on their side of the map while you set up your own third base is crucial.
- Save at least one scan to kill creep. As a Zerg, losing your initial midgame creep and a Queen or two spreading it can be devastating for the later stages of the game.

Pros and Cons

This build opens quite economically, and then transitions into making a strong army and hitting your opponent with a lot of units at the 9 minute mark before they can even stabilize their third base economy. It is a very strong build for punishing greedy Zergs.

However, while it is a CC First opener that is not at all all-in, it is definitely not nearly as macro-oriented as the standard Reactor Hellion 3CC build or other 3CC builds such as Polts Map Control Build. Also, if your opponent can see it coming and overproduces units to defend, you will have to pick up and rely on drop play instead of a large frontal assault to get an advantage.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Bunker,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SCV,CallMule,Factory,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,SCV,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Refinery,TechLabOnBarracks,CallMule,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,StimPack,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marauder,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Starport,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleHellions,SCV,Marauder,SCV,CallMule,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,Marauder,DoubleMedivacs,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnFactory,Marauder,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:12 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'MC Oracle Expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This PvT opener opens with early Oracles to smash through un-upgraded marines and harass your opponents mineral line, all while taking an expansion back at home and transitioning into the midgame.

Scouting

This build opens aggressively with lots of units, so there is no need to be worried about early pressure. However, in order for you to control your Oracles well and attack in the correct places, it is necessary to know what your opponent is building. Thus, use your early game map control with your Stalkers and Mothership Core to poke in and see whether your opponent is going for Widow Mines/where they are building Turrets/how they have positioned their Marines so that you will know when and how to attack with your oracles.

Transitions

This build transitions into any normal midgame that you would like. At around the 8 minute mark, plant down either a Robotics Facility or Twilight Council to start your teching into Colossus or High Templars+Storm. Then, after your Oracle harass has finished, you will already be halfway to your desired tech. Getting more gateways down and the upgrades (+1 Ground Armor and Charge/Storm) started while you are harassing your opponent is very important.

Alternatively, you can go for a Phoenix/Colossus midgame army. Plant down a Robotics Facility at around the 8 minute mark and tech straight for Colossi on 4 Assimilators. When your Robotics Bay finishes, start 2 more Gateways, start your first Colossus, and begin producing Phoenix in order to re-converge to a play style akin to Jims Phoenix/Colossus Build.

Tips

- Use your first Stalker to deny an SCV/Reaper scout and keep your opponent in the dark as to what build you are going.
- Rally your Oracles to an airspace near your opponents base so that your push happens as soon as you are ready.
- The Mothership Core can poke in and around your opponents main base to see what tech buildings they have and/or what units they are building.
- Go in with your first Oracle if they opened with gas to start applying pressure soon. If you wait for 3 or 4 Oracles, a Widow Mine drop might be already on the way and you would not be able to defend it.
- Wait for more Oracles if they opened gasless 1rax FE and your stalkers have not been able to do any damage. If you go in too soon, then theyll just build a reactive missile turret and shut down your later Oracles.
- Remember: Oracles scale REALLY well. 3 Oracles can take down up to 10 marines without losing a single Oracle.  Be aggressive vs marines, and super defensive vs turrets/widow mines.
- Do not forget to include the Mothership Core in the fight  its DPS and Time Warp spell are very useful when taking out marines/units.
- Start that midgame transition BEFORE you focus on the harass in your opponents base so that after the Oracle harass has finished, you will already be halfway to your desired midgame tech.

Pros and Cons

This build gives you map control and hits your opponents with a lot of early game Oracles to destroy a mineral line. It is strong because Oracles absolutely destroy un-upgraded marines, and are maneuverable enough that they can track down and run after SCVs.

However, opening with this build delays your expand a lot more than if you had opened straight 1gate FE. Because you have less economy, the midgame Terran timing attacks with medivacs are even scarier than normal (unless you do damage with your Oracles), so you actually have to do damage to attempt to transition into the midgame. Remember that Oracles have very little health, so you have to babysit your units if you have any hope of not losing them instantly to a well placed Missile Turret/Widow Mine.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,MothershipCore,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Stargate,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Oracle,Probe,Nexus,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Chronoboost,Oracle,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Oracle,Probe,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:12 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Maru Reaper FE to Hellbat-Banshee Push', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE transitions into a fast 2 base Hellbat Banshee timing in order to crush your opponent early regardless of whether or not they open with Roaches.

Scouting

Use your Reaper to poke around your opponents natural and ascertain whether or not they are performing an early all-in. Later, when you have Hellions out, poke the front to ensure that your opponent is taking a 3rd base and not performing some delayed 2 base all-in. Favor keeping your Hellions alive over getting more scouting information/killing Drones because you will need every Hellion later for the Hellbat Banshee timing.

During your actual attack, be sure to note whether your opponent is defending with Roaches (which means a potential Roach/Hydra midgame, or at the very least delayed Mutalisks) or with Ling/Bane (which means a probable Ling/Bane/Muta midgame, and a more standard Mutalisk timing).

Transitions

This build opens with a 1/1/1 and therefore does not yet commit to a Bio or Mech midgame. It can in fact transition into either quite easily.

For a Bio (+Hellbat or Widow Mine) transition, start your 3rd Command Center as you swap off your Barracks onto the Starports Tech lab in order to start Stimpack research, 2 Engineering Bays, and 4 more Barracks. Use non-Stimpack Medivac drops to delay your opponent while you get up the necessary midgame infrastructure.

For a Mech transition, start your 3rd Command Center, 2 Factories, and 2 more Refineries. Continue Banshee production to deal with a Roach counter-attack as well as take advantage of the delayed Mutalisk tech.

Tips

- Use your initial Marine to try and pick off an early scouting Overlord as well as deny early Drone scouts.
- Your Reaper is not meant to deal damage, but rather give you some basic scouting and map control.
- Do NOT over-commit your Hellions while scouting around your opponents base; you will need all of them for the followup Hellbat Banshee timing to be effective.
- Try and position a Marine or two inside your base to shoot down any scouting Overlords.
- During the actual Hellbat Banshee attack, be sure to stutter step into Roaches and Queens, and spread/kite Zerglings and Banelings.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong 2 base all-in that can outright kill an unsuspecting Zerg opponent, and at the very least forces a huge response in order to defend. By forcing your opponent to make an army, you keep both of your economies low and extend the midgame (where Terran is arguably best in TvZ). Also, this build is better than an exclusively Hellbat attack because of Banshees effectiveness against Roaches.

However this attack requires a lot of micro in order to keep up with a rally of Hellions and Banshees. Also, it is a 2 base build, so has a much smaller economy than standard macro play.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Reaper,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,Factory,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,LiftRaxFromReactor,ReactorOnBarracks,CallMule,SCV,Starport,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SCV,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,DoubleHellions,Refinery,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnStarport,SCV,SCV,CallMule,CallMule,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleHellions,SCV,SCV,CloakingField,Banshee,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Armory,SCV,SCV,DoubleHellions,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,Banshee,CallMule,DoubleHellions', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:12 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'MKP 1-1-1 All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This is a highly aggressive, 1 base 1/1/1 all-in which focuses on early harass to damage your opponent while simultaneously building up army for a follow-up all-in. While this build has the potential to fall back into a macro game, transitioning into the midgame is difficult if early damage is not inflicted on the opponent.

Scouting

This build gives you several opportunities for scouting. Your first bit of information comes from getting your scouting SCV into his base between 12 and 16 food. If you manage to get your SCV into your opponents base, check for how many Refineries your opponent has. If your opponent does not have gas, they will most likely be doing a 1rax FE build. This presents one of the better scenarios for your early game Hellion drop to workespecially if your opponent does not anticipate the Hellion drop. If your opponent has one Refinery, it likely means that your opponent will be going for Reapers, have a Marine/Hellion defense, or have a Marine/Widow Mine defense. With your Hellions drop, do not over commit, simply keep your opponent busy. If your opponent attempts to Hellion expand, he will pull ahead economically assuming his defense prevents your hellions from inflicting any damage. You will most likely not see a second gas geyser with your SCV scout.

Once you have your first Hellions out, you should have full map control by clearing any XelNaga Towers and poking the front. Running in to spot your opponents natural is also a smart move, but be sure to pull back if there are any units defending. Your Hellions are there to increase the effectiveness of your later all-in, not to end the game early on.

Lastly, when you Hellion drop in his main, you should finally be able to see everything your opponent has gone for. If your opponent has gone for Cloaked Banshees, it will not instantly be a threat because he will need to keep the Banshee in his base to defend his workers. Later, once you have a Raven, Banshees will no longer be an issue. If your opponent has gone for Hellions of his own, be careful when out on the map, and always favor retreating if your Hellions are in danger. If your opponent has gone for Widow Mines, be sure to avoid obvious spots where he could have placed them.

Ideal Game

Your Hellion drop should inflict some kind of damage to your opponent and keep him occupied with defensive measures. However, even while doing damage with them, it is important to keep them alive. With ideal Hellion harass, your later all-in will overwhelm your opponent or trade in your favor.

If your opponent is prepared for the all-in engagement, he will most likely have either a Bunker, Siege Tanks, or both to defend. Your Hellions from earlier can help clear SCVs repairing the Bunker. Assuming you need to siege and push slowly because he has Tanks, consider dropping your Hellions again to divert some forces and his attention. However, remember that every unit is precious, so do not over commit with this drop.

Transitioning

In the situation where you cannot straight up win the game with your all-in but still have him contained, consider expanding and transitioning into Marine/Tank play or Mech. Simply throw down an expansion, take more gas, and ramp up your production from there.

If the all-in fails and your opponent is ahead economically, then you will have most likely lost the game. However, expanding and defending this base with Siege Tanks can still be a last-ditch option.

Tips

- With your first two Hellions, clear the XelNaga Watchtowers and take map control.
- During your Hellion drop, be sure to constantly pump Marines from your Reactored Barracks and produce Siege Tanks.  The strength of this build is the follow-up all-in, not the initial Hellion drop.
- Do NOT lose your Hellions when dropping them.  Use the Medivac boost to get your Hellions out of there if they are ever in danger.
- When moving out, be sure to bring 2 SCVs to repair.
- Slowly siege your opponent unless you are sure you can crush through the front.
- Remember to use Seeker Missile or Auto Turrets from your Raven to push the fight in your favor.

Pros and Cons

This build is a 1-2 punch of sortsfirst hitting with a Hellion drop and then following up with a Marine/Tank all-in. It is often too much for expanding opponents to handle and quickly ends the game. The Hellion drop can also be deadly harass if your opponent does not scout it or defend appropriately.

However, because this build was created by MarineKing himself, it is quite micro intensive, and thus is hard to pull off as a lower league player.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker back to the protection of your Sentries/Force fields and warp-in units quickly if you have to defend an early attack.

The majority of your scouting comes from your Hallucinated Phoenix. Your phoenix should be able to get into your opponents main base and determine what tech route you see your opponent going.

- If your opponent is expanding quickly, then feel safe. Consider going for a midgame Immortal+Gateway bust.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then be sure that you do not fall behind in the Immortal/Colossus count going into the midgame. Do NOT over produce Stalkers.
- If your opponent has a Stargate, then be sure to not take damage against early Phoenix or Oracles. Produce several Stalkers to initially protect your mineral lines, but consider getting a Stargate of your own or going for a quick Blink timing in order to truly stay safe against your opponent. Keep a tabs on when they take their natural expansion  a 3gate Stargate attack can be deadly if you are skipping too many warp-ins or teching too aggressively.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then make one Observer for detection against DTs and constantly produce Immortals. Also be sure to position your army/Mothership Core defensively in order to safely defend any Blink attacks.

Transitions

This build is a very strong macro opener that transitions into a macro game quite easily. However, the actual unit composition of that macro game very often depends completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with. If your opponent stays on one base for too long, then throw down more Gateways, constantly make units, and prepare to defend your natural with Stalkers, Immortals, and your Planetary Nexus. In Robotics vs Stargate macro games, quickly switch into Blink or Stargate play of your own so as to not lose against any Void Ray based armies. In Robotics vs Robotics macro games, Immortal count and/or Colossus count are the most important things.  Keep tabs on your opponents tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Robotics vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponents potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by producing Immortals+Gateway units or Colossus for defense.

Tips

- Use all your initial chronoboost on Probes so as to establish your economic advantage going into the midgame.
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial Stalker to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Traps 3gate All-in).
- Against all 1 base attacks, you must defend using your Planetary Nexus. To maximize your protection, save your Mothership Core energy as long as possible  only calling in your Planetary Nexus once your opponent has committed to attacks. Be sure to constantly chronoboost Immortals out for maximum DPS against ground-based armies.
- Against Blink play, be sure to position some of your army and an Immortal or two in your main base to destroy any Stalkers that blink up outside the range of your Planetary Nexus.
- Against Stargate play, be sure to warp-in some initial Stalkers and position your units to defend both mineral lines from potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very versatile, macro build that takes advantage of the power and range of your Planetary Nexus in order to stay safe against early attacks. It also gets detection and Immortals for defense, so very often you have a more stable opening than most other PvP builds.

However, defending early Stargate play can be quite tricky as your Robotics Facility does not help at all in producing anti-air units. Also, this build requires a lot of scouting information to be executed effectively, so getting a Hallucination into your opponents base is crucial.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Probe,MothershipCore,Sentry,Nexus,Gateway,Sentry,Pylon,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Immortal,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:12 PM;

This build opens with a Gateway Expand and then transitions into a very quick all-in with 2 Immortals, a Warp Prism, and a lot of +1 Zealots.

Scouting

After the early game, scouting is much more minimal than you might expect. As long as you can confirm your opponent is getting a third Hatchery, you should be able to go through with this build.

However, if your opponent scouts your Robotics Facility early on, then you can send your Warp Prism directly towards your opponent?s base in order to both fake pressure and see what units/buildings they have made.  This Warp Prism poke provides a bit of scouting that may help you deduce what unit composition your opponent will try to defend your all-in with.

Transitions

This build is a 2base all-in, so there is no standard way to follow-up this build should the attack not outright win the game. If your opponent holds off your all-in without taking too much damage, then you will most likely lose the game soon after. That being said, starting more Assimilators and teching to either Colossi or Blink Stalkers (depending on what unit composition your opponent used to defend your all-in) for a second desperation all-in might just be enough to win the game.

Tips

- The limiting factor in this build is the Robotics Facility time. Be sure to chronoboost your Robotics Facility to get out the Warp Prism and Immortals in time for such a fast attack.
- Send your Warp Prism to your opponent?s base as soon as it completes for both fake pressure and potential scouting information.
- When you move out for the attack, be sure to fully wall-off your natural expansion (and even potentially build some cannons) to stop your opponent from running around your army and going for a base trade.
- The most important part of the army are your Robotics units. Keep your Zealots all in front of your Immortals/Warp Prism so that they tank all (or most) incoming damage. Using the Warp Prism, pick up Immortals that are being targeted down to move them further back behind your Zealot meat shield. If your Warp Prism is being targeted down, bring it out of the fight and retreat a bit before warping in more Zealots.
- If your opponent is trying to defend with Roaches or Mutalisks and you have a little extra gas, then mix in some Stalkers into the mix for some extra DPS.

Pros and Cons

This is a strong all-in that hits before your opponent can have much tech out in order to end the game quickly. With +1 Zealots dealing lots of damage to Zerglings, and Immortals shredding up Roaches, this build walks through most Zerg defenses with ease.

However, none of your units are anti-air. Thus, if your opponent gets out Mutalisks before your attack has dealt lots of damage, then you will be in a lot of trouble. Also, losing a single Immortal or the Warp Prism due to poor micro can almost instantly lose you the game.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Nexus,MothershipCore,WarpgateUpgrade,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Probe,Forge,Gateway,Probe,Zealot,Probe,Probe,WarpPrism,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Immortal,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Immortal,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,Pylon,Observer,Chronoboost,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:12 PM;

This build opens with a 1gate FE and then transitions into a strong timing attack with +2/+2 Chargelots and Archons.

Benchmark: When you start Charge (@8:10ish), you should have 1 Mothership Core, 1 Stalker, 3 Sentries, and 45 Probes.

Push out when your 3rd Archon finishes (@11:00ish) with 3 Sentries, 3 Archons, 1 Stalker, and around 12 Zealots, with +2/+2 about to finish.

Scouting

In the early game, Probe scout after your Gateway in order to spot whether your opponent is opening with a Reaper or Widow Mine drop. Against Reaper play you have to position your initial few units very defensively in order to avoid losing any Probes. Against a Widow Mine drop, be sure to build those Photon Cannons in your mineral lines as soon as your Forges finish. After the early game, scouting is much more minimal than you might expect. As long as you can confirm your opponent is not 1 base all-inning you (Hallucinations can give you a lot of information), you can perform this build.

Transitions

This build is a strong two base timing attack, so be sure to commit all your energy into non-stop warping in from a proxy Pylon in order to bust through your opponents front. In most situations, you will simply be able to walk through your opponents front and win the game.

However, if your opponent has a strong defense at his natural (Supply Depots and multiple Bunkers), you do already have plenty of Probes back at home, so you can simply start a 3rd Nexus, resume Probe Production, continue upgrades by getting +3/+3, and transition into Storm play. If you are going for this macro play, then be sure to get out several Colossus before you max out for a stronger 200 supply army.

Tips

- You are only able to afford so many units because of how many Probes you have. Be sure to Chronoboost your Nexii as often as possible in the early game to get up a strong 2 base economy.
- The limiting factor in this build is the Forge upgrades.  After the early game, Chronoboost your Forges as often as you can so that your 11 minute attack hits with +2/+2.
- Hallucinate Phoenix to get scouting information on your opponents opening build order.
- Against Reaper play, position your initial units defensively.
- Against Widow Mine play, be sure to get out those Photon Cannons in each mineral line on time. Using your Photon Overcharge and target firing an early Medivac can be a game changer in defending early pressure.
- Set up multiple proxy Pylons before you are ready to move out so that even if your opponent kills one or two of them, you will be able to reinforce your attack.
- During the attack, be sure that your army does not waste time attacking buildings.  Focus fire and reposition your army so that everything is always fighting your opponents army.
- If your opponent has a solid wall at his natural, then do not commit to a doomed attack. Simply playing the macro game with your upgrade advantage is a much stronger option.

Pros and Cons

This is a strong attack that destroys Bio players who do not have good building placement or who are playing too greedy. Also, your strong attack has +2/+2 and 60 Probes  so even if it fails, you have a strong economy and upgrade lead going into the late game.

This build is not great against early Widow Mine drops because your only detection is the Photon Cannons in your mineral lines. However if you defend a Widow Mine drop without losing too much, your follow-up attack will destroy your opponent unless they are very well prepared.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Nexus,MothershipCore,WarpgateUpgrade,Pylon,Stalker,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Forge,Forge,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,GroundWeaponsLevel1,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,GroundArmorLevel1,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,WarpInSentry,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,TwilightCouncil,Probe,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,Charge,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,GroundWeaponsLevel2,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,GroundArmorLevel2,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,TemplarArchives,Probe,Probe,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,WarpInHighTemplar,WarpInHighTemplar,WarpInHighTemplar,Pylon,Pylon,Pylon,WarpInHighTemplar,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInHighTemplar,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInZealot,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,WarpInHighTemplar,ArchonFromTwoHT,ArchonFromTwoHT,ArchonFromTwoHT,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:12 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'PartinG 3 Base 7 Gate', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Nexus First and only enough units to secure a ridiculously fast 3rd base. With a 3 base economy, it then hits a 9 minute 7 gate attack comprised of mainly Stalkers and Sentries.

Scouting

This build opens incredibly greedily, so be sure that your opponent is expanding and droning with an initial Probe scout. Besides any initial Probe(s), however, this build does not give you any tools with which to scout your opponent. The majority of your scouting will come with the actual attack at 9 minutes.

Transitions

This build can either all-in or transition comfortably into a macro game.

If you are choosing to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly warp-in and chronoboost your Gateways, set up several proxy Pylons around your opponent?s third base, and stop all Probe production.

If you are choosing to play the macro game, then only use the attack to hopefully deal a bit of damage while you continue producing Probes and teching at home. Getting a Twilight Council, all of your gasses, and going for a +2 Blink Stalker army is a good choice.  Alternatively, you can start a Robotics Facility, all of your gasses, and go straight for Colossi.

Tips

- Spend all of your early game chronoboost on your two Nexus to maximize Probe production.
- Keep your Mothership Core out in front of your natural to help ward off any scouting Zerglings.
- Until you are ready to attack, position your Sentries and Zealot very defensively. Staying against buildings or walls will increase the effectiveness of defensive force fields dramatically.
- Use 2 of your Gateways to wall-in a Photon Cannon while your third base is being set up. A Cannon that cannot be targeted by Zerglings is incredibly effective at stopping runbys.
- Be sure to start moving out before +1 actually finishes in order to hit your opponent as early as possible.
- Constantly warp-in Stalkers with the attack, using your initial 8 Sentries to keep back enemy Roach/Ling armies.
- Don?t forget to mass recall your army back home if you end up getting surrounded.

Pros and Cons

This build is an incredibly greedy build that initially powers economy hard and then transitions into a powerful 7 Gate attack. You have both a strong army and a strong economy.

However, this build does not get much tech before the attack. Therefore, transitioning out of your attack into a more standard unit composition takes more time than more standard PvZ builds.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Nexus,Gateway,Pylon,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Zealot,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,MothershipCore,Sentry,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Forge,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,GroundWeaponsLevel1,Sentry,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Nexus,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,PhotonCanon,PhotonCanon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,WarpInSentry,WarpInSentry,WarpInSentry,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,WarpInSentry,WarpInSentry,WarpInStalker,Probe,Probe', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:12 PM;

This cheese proxies your initial Pylon at your opponent?s natural and makes Stalkers 2 at a time from 2 proxied Gateways. This proxy Stalker Rush is a very effective cheese that focuses on early game micro to destroy your opponent before the midgame.

Scouting

This build skips all scouting, for you are placing your first Pylon proxied at your opponent?s natural expansion regardless of what your opponent is doing. All of your scouting will come from your initial attack with your first Gateway units. The build itself will not change regardless of what you scout ? only your unit positioning and micro.

Transitions

This proxy Stalker Rush is an all-in in every respect: proxying the initial Pylon at your opponent?s natural, cutting Probe production at 12, non-stop chronoboosting your Gateways, and skipping Warpgate Research. Thus, there is no well-defined transition. If you are late in your execution and do not outright kill your opponent (or at least take out their army and 10+ Probes), then you will most likely lose the game to any sort of Gateway attack follow-up.

Tips

- ALL OF YOUR CHRONOBOOST MUST BE DUMPED INTO YOUR GATEWAYS. The limiting factor on this build is how fast you can pump out units from your Gateways. Be sure to non-stop chronoboost your Gateways as they are producing the Zealot and later Stalkers so as to attack as early as possible.
- Poke in with your first Zealot and Probe and force your opponent to lose mining time. However, be wary of a Probe surround. Favor keeping the Zealot alive over killing enemy Probes.
- Once your first 2 Stalkers finish, you must commit to the attack as quickly as possible and never stop Stalker production until either you have won the game or you have lost all of your units. The strength of this all-in is how quickly and ferociously it attacks, but if you are not constantly attacking then your opponent?s economic advantage can destroy you.
- If your opponent pulls a lot of Probes to defend, be sure to back off and fight near the main ramp. Use your 18 Pylon to buffer damage and provide high ground vision for your Stalkers to shoot up the cliff.

Pros and Cons

This proxy Stalker Rush is a hyper-aggressive all-in that is able to get 2 Stalkers and 1 Zealot at your opponent?s base at 4:00. Because of how quickly this build attacks, it can punish most greedy PvP builds or players with poor micro with ease.
Unfortunately, this all-in can be scouted because your initial buildings must all be built in your opponent?s natural.  However, it being easy to scout and easy to defend are two fundamentally different things, so you can still win with this build quite often.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Gateway,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Zealot,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Stalker,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Stalker,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:12 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Polt 2 Reaper FE to Hellions-Viking-Medivac', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'Scouting

Because this build opens with as many different map control units as Terran has, there is no need for super early SCV scouting. Your initial scout comes from your Reaper(s) poking into your opponents base. Check for a lack of a natural, early gas, or any quick tech buildings. Consider cutting Hellions and getting Widow Mines instead if your opponent is going for a very early all-in.

The next scout comes from your Reapers and Hellions poking the front.  You should be able to spot a 3rd base and your opponents Queen count.  If you see a lack of Queens and no 3rd base, then be prepared for a 2 base all-in of sorts. Extra bunkers, a full wall-off, and Marauders/Siege Tanks are the best ways to defend most Roach or Baneling based all-ins.

Finally, your last scout comes from a Medivac drop and your Viking. Use your Viking to kill Overlords blocking your 3rd base or scouting around the map. You can also use the Viking to keep tabs on your opponents base count up until they have any anti-air (usually Mutalisks). Be sure not to lose the Viking to Queens, however, so stay off creep. Also, use your Medivac drop for map control at the front. Scan, kill creep, and pick up and leave with your 8 units up everywhere your opponent is spreading creep until your opponent has Mutalisks.

This build gets you map control in every way: initial ground control comes from your Reapers; follow-up ground control comes from your Reaper/Hellion pokes; follow-up air control comes from your Viking on Overlord-killing duty; and follow-up creep control comes from a squadron of Marine/Marauder in your Medivac. Be sure to use all of these to their fullest in order to have maximum scouting information.

Transitions

This build transitions well into both Marine/Tank or Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine. It can also transition into Mech, but anyone who watches Polt as a player knows that he never goes Mech in basically any matchup, so I have opted not to write-up the Mech transition.

For either transition, start Stimpack research and 2 Engineering Bays so that your midgame army will have some staying power on the field. Once you have minerals, throw down up to 7 Barracks and an extra Factory to reach the 3 base infrastructure that you need to out-produce your Zerg opponent. Start producing Siege Tanks or Widow Mines from your initial Factory to get a healthy unit count while you are building up your Bio army.

Lift up your third base and take your third once you feel safe, starting an Armory so as to continue your upgrades. Remember to stay on top of your huge mineral count. Because this build only stays on 3 buildings for unit production for quite some time, but gets you a similar income, your mineral income will seem much larger than you think. Start those Engineering Bays and Barracks as soon as you can afford them for a strong midgame army.

Tips

- Do NOT over commit your initial Reapers by trying to kill Drones. Use them more for scouting and prioritize keeping them alive so as to keep your opponents early game units back at home.
- Do NOT over commit your initial Reaper/Hellion poke by trying to kill Drones. Again, use them more for scouting and prioritize keeping them alive unless you see a huge opening that you can punish (such as spotting your opponents Queens off creep and knowing that your opponent does not have Zergling Speed).
- If you spot your opponent going all-in, then be sure to stop map-control-unit production and instantly begin Widow Mines and Marauders. Adding an extra Bunker and/or completing your wall-off at your natural will help provide buffers against any incoming attacks as well.
- When your Viking pops, be sure to shoot down as many Overlords as you can. Simply shift-queue up an attack route around all of your side of the map in order to kill any Overlords your opponent has that are off creep.
Use your initial Medivac and several Marines/Marauders for creep-killing duty. Scan, kill creep, and pick up and leave with your 8 units up everywhere your opponent is spreading creep until your opponent has Mutalisks. Try and pick off a Queen if you can.
- Once you throw down your 3rd Command Center, you are going to have A LOT of minerals. Be sure to transition quickly by starting the Engineering Bays, Barracks, and Refineries as soon as you can afford them.

Pros and Cons

This build is quite strong because of its ability to scout and harass early on.  With Reapers, Hellions, Vikings, and Medivacs all being used to take map control, and a 1/1/1 at home with the versatility to react to whatever units your opponent seems to be making, this build is also quite safe against any early all-ins that your opponent might try to do. Finally, if your opponent ever slips up and does not adequately prepare for your continuous production of map control units, you can quickly kill many Drones and take a huge economic advantage as what happens in game 5 of Polt vs HyuN.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Polt Reaper FE into 3 Rax', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE gets out a lot of units quickly in order to defend any Oracle or Blink Stalker attacks, while transitioning directly into completely standard 2 Base bio infrastructure. The versatility of this build sets it apart from the other TvP openers: Polts build lets you defend, attack, or play off any shenanigans your opponent may through at you.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they get an expansion (or note if they do not expand by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Extra Bunkers and/or an Engineering Bay for defense may be a smart investment.

If your opponent is going for a 2 Base Blink Stalker attack, then slow down your tech and gas income in favor of more units and more Bunkers. Start 2 Bunkers at the front and be ready to repair them with SCVs while you buy time for Combat Shields, more Marauders, and eventual Medivacs to pop.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and a large Bio army.  As you are taking map control with your initial Medivacs, be sure to add a 3rd Command Center, 2 more Barracks, and finish getting Concussive Shells and Combat Shields. Add on another Engineering Bay and an Armory to continue your upgrades as soon as you can afford it.

Note that you can switch the order of the 4th and 5th Barracks with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost and the scary late game Protoss army, most Terrans have been getting their infrastructure up early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having extra reinforcements.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important; if you keep all of your SCVs in gas, then you will not have the minerals to get your Command Center or extra Barracks at the correct time.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper.  Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add up to 2 Bunkers at the front, and start that Marauder production as soon as possible.
- Oracles massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you should consider skipping Marauders for more Marines or even start an emergency Engineering Bay for one turret per mineral line.
- Polt sometimes goes for an optional poke with his initial Marauder and several Marines if he has confirmed his opponent is not going for a Stargate. Be sure to keep these units alive  their only purpose is to take up a central XelNaga Watch tower
- When transitioning into the midgame, setting up your infrastructure while being aggressive with your first few Medivacs can outright win you the game.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because of the versatility inherent in its play. It makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game, gets up enough infrastructure to deal with all early and midgame attacks such as Oracle all-ins or Blink Stalker Timings, and then transitions into a completely standard bio midgame. It truly is an effective build to learn if you want to play safe and standard in TvP.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that it requires good scouting in order to take advantage of the versatility inherent in the build.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GoOutScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,MineralScv,CallMule,SCV,CommandCenter,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,Marine,StimPack,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,DoubleMarines,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,Factory,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,ScannerSweep,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,CallMule,Refinery,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,EngineeringBay,Marine,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,DoubleMarines,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,CombatShield,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,SCV,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMedivacs,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,ConcussiveShells,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:13 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Polt Gas First Banshee', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This gas first Banshee opener used by Polt and many other top level Korean Terrans opens with the fastest Cloaked Banshees possible. The Banshee(s) are used to stay safe against early attacks as well as harass your opponent, in order to get an economic advantage going into the midgame.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your Orbital Command to check whether or not your opponent is opening with Reapers. Against an opponent opening Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe; thus, you should try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or expanded at your natural with your first few Marines.

Your next scout will come with your Banshee. With this Banshee, you can check what your opponents opener is. Against another Banshee player, follow-up your first Banshee with a Raven (and then potentially Viking if extra anti-air is needed). Against a Hellbat dropping player, make a few Widow Mines to burrow defensively against any incoming drop, as you use several Banshees to out-harass him. Against a player going for a Widow Mine Drop, position your Marines defensively at home and be sure to have enough scans to deal with his Widow Mines. Building a Raven might be useful, but not until after you have 2 Banshees with which to harass your opponent.

Finally, be sure to keep an eye out on what midgame transition your opponent is doing. Look for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either all-in, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play quite easily.

For an all-in transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory and start Siege Tank production instantly. When you hit 2 or 3 Siege Tanks, grab all of your Marines (>20), your Banshees/Vikings, and attempt to break your opponents front with a slow siege push.

It is possible to go into Marine/Tank or Mech after a 3 Command Center follow-up if you are sure your opponent will not be going for any more early game pressure. Start a Raven in order to save enough minerals to afford 2 Command Centers and then transition into either Marine/Tank or Mech just as below.

When transitioning into macro Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production after you start a 2nd Command Center. That way you have enough defense early and later can have a strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use. Against 2rax Reaper, you should delay your Tech lab until your Factory has completed at least one Hellion. Otherwise you might straight up die before you even start your first Banshee.
- Watch for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop your Banshee as you enter your opponents base.  Cloak your Banshee as soon as you see any potential for burrowed Widow Mines.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that are undefended by a Turret. If you are transitioning to a 1/1/1 all-in, then be sure to target-fire Marines as well, for this directly strengthens your attack.
- Always favor keeping your Banshee(s) alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two. You can also repair a weakened Banshee at home with SCVs if you can keep it alive.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural.  You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This gas first Banshee build is an aggressive opener in TvT. Also, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for you are able to transition into an all-in, 3 Command Center play, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play. Also, this build requires a lot less APM than other TvT builds, so it can be very useful for lower league players.

However, this build is extraordinarily weak against early Reaper builds because you open with so few Marines. Also, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind your opponent in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades, especially if they open with a fast expansion. Finally, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,SCV,Factory,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,Refinery,SCV,Marine,Starport,TechLabOnFactory,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,LandStarportOnTechLab,Banshee,CloakingField,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,CallMule,WidowMine,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Banshee,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:13 PM;

This safe fast expand build opens with a 1gate FE and then transitions into Colossi and double upgrades as fast as possible in order to go into the late game with an upgrade and tech advantage over a Terran opponent.

Benchmark: @100% +1/+1 (@10:30ish), you should have around 55 Probes, 1 Sentry, and 2 Colossi.

Scouting

This is a very safe macro build, getting you enough units in the early game for scouting or defensive purposes, so Probe scouting is usually unnecessary.  If your opponent sends a Reaper at your base, then be defensive with your initial Zealot/Stalker, and use only your Mothership Core to scout around.  If your opponent does NOT send a Reaper at your base, then poke out with your initial Zealot/Stalker and later Mothership Core to poke at your opponents front and glean some information about their build.

While your early game is completely safe, therefore making Probe scouting irrelevant, the early midgame is not, and thus scouting is crucial. If you know that your opponent is going for a Widow Mine drop, then get out Observers and several more Stalkers and place them defensively in each mineral line. Be prepared to use the Mothership Cores Photon Overcharge on whichever Nexus your opponent chooses to drop. Delay Colossus tech in order to favor more units to deal with the harass. This same reaction works against all early drop-based or Banshee play. Against any early frontal assaults, simply Planetary Nexus your natural expansion and warp-in several more units.

Transitions

This build is quite macro-oriented, so playing for the long-game is crucial.  Against standard Bio play, Bio/Mine play, or Bio/Hellbat play, take your third base after your 3rd Colossus and transition into Chargelots, Archons, and Storm. Add more Gateways as your minerals permit. Also, Blink is a good upgrade to prioritize against heavy drop play on maps with a large distance between your main and third bases.

Against Mech play, take your third base and begin heavy Immortal production.  Make Immortals, Archons, and High Templar while on 3 bases, and focus on hitting a +3/+3 timing attack before your opponent is maxed.  Add more Robotics Facilities as your gas permits.

Pros and Cons

This build stays safe against early shenanigans as you macro up and tech straight for Colossus and +1/+1. It also gives you the infrastructure necessary to defend early drops or harassment common in this matchup.  With your upgrade lead and tech advantage, you can safely transition into the lategame by safely taking another base and going for Storm.

Tips

- Chronoboost your initial Nexus to get out as many probes as early as possible to kick start your economy.
- Use your initial units defensively if you spot a Reaper, or aggressively to scout your opponents base if no Reaper appears at your door by the time your Stalker has popped.
- Send your first Observer directly to your opponents base in order to see if hes opening with fast Widow Mines/harassing units, or teching up to a normal Bio timing. Only warp-in units before you get your first Colossus out if you scout your opponent playing aggressively. Delay your Colossus tech and production if you spot your opponent going for a quick drop or early attack play. Instead, focus on making Gateway units and Observers and placing them defensively to maintain your economic advantage. However, if your opponent is NOT attacking early, always prioritize economy and teching up over making Gateway units
- Never underestimate the power of making your Nexus a Planetary Nexus.  At the very least, it is a way to scare off a drop from doing economic damage if your army is out of position.
- Against early drops, target firing the Medivac with your Stalkers and Planetary Nexus can mean the difference between letting your opponent escape and crushing a poorly planned drop.
- Dont forget to use your Mothership Cores Time Warp spell against any 2 base Bio timings in order to keep your Colossus safe.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Zealot,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,Chronoboost,WarpgateUpgrade,Probe,Probe,Probe,Nexus,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Pylon,Probe,RoboticsFacility,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Observer,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Observer,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,RoboticsBay,Probe,Chronoboost,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Forge,Forge,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,GroundWeaponsLevel1,GroundArmorLevel1,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,ExtendedThermalLance,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,TwilightCouncil,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:13 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Proxy Thor Drop', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build rushes for Thors and a Medivac as fast as possible and then goes for a hilarious all-in with Thor Drops. There is no transition with this build  you pull all your SCVs and crush your opponent as soon as possible.

Scouting

There is no purpose scouting. You are going to do the same build no matter what, and it only wastes mining time to pull an SCV from the mineral line.

Transitions

There are no transitions from this all-in. Keep rallying Marines and your next Thor and all of your SCVs and hope it is enough to win the game.

Tips

- When your Medivac pops, load up your Thor and drop your opponent, trying to kill production or SCVs.
- Avoid fighting your opponents army with your initial Thor drop at all costs. Only engage your opponents army directly once your Marines and SCVs are in the fight as well.
- Make sure to pull around 10 SCVs and attack with all of your Marines when you start your 2nd Thor so that your 2 Thors, 12 Marines, and 10 SCVs all get to your opponents base at the same time.
- During the fight, surround your Thor(s) with SCVs and repair.
- Use your Marines for a bit of extra DPS as they sit behind your Thor(s), but the true power of this all-in comes from the fact that Thors being repaired take close to no damage from early game Terran units.

Pros and Cons

This build rolls over most 1rax FE builds. Also, its a hilarious all-in that straight up kills unprepared opponents or opponents who dont have good repair micro. Also, a huge pro is that this build IS A THOR DROP.

However, this build is very weak against Reapers because you only have 2 Marines to defend against Reapers in the early game. That being said, if you can ward off the Reapers without losing too many SCVs, you might still win because Thors are obviously strong against Reapers in direct fights.  This build is also very bad against Banshees, but its possible to win the base trade because Thors also destroy Banshees in an actual fight.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Factory,CallMule,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Armory,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,Starport,SCV,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,Thor,Medivac,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Thor,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:13 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Reaper FE into 3 Rax Stim Timing', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE transitions into a very quick 2 base Stim timing with Combat Shields. With such a fast attack, you can set the pace of the game instead of letting Protoss dictate when you attack.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they get an expansion (or note if they do not expand by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Extra Bunkers and/or an Engineering Bay for defense may be a smart investment. However, if you can hold until Stimpack and Combat Shields finish (@8:50ish  much earlier than most other builds), then you will be in a great position to counter attack your opponent and do crippling damage.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and a large Bio army.  Before you focus on your attack, be sure to start a Factory for a standard Reactored Medivac follow-up. After the attack, get a 3rd Command Center, 2 more Barracks (for a total of 5), 2 Engineering Bays, and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to head into a strong, late game army.

Note that you can switch the order of the 4th and 5th Barracks with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost and the scary late game Protoss army, most Terrans have been getting their infrastructure up early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having extra reinforcements.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important; if you keep all of your SCVs in gas, then you will not have the minerals to get your Command Center or extra Barracks at the correct time.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add up to 2 Bunkers at the front, and start that Marauder production as soon as possible.
- Oracles massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you should consider skipping Marauders for more Marines or even start an emergency Engineering Bay for one turret per mineral line. Note that even if your opponent does early game damage with an Oracle, your 9 minute attack can still end the game if your opponents follow-up is not executed precisely.
- Be sure to move out with your army BEFORE Stimpack and Combat Shields finish. You want to be attacking your opponents natural expansion as soon as those two upgrades finish.
- If your opponent is out of position, you can kill their entire army or snipe their natural expansion. However, be sure that you focus fire one or the other down  losing too much DPS by having your units attack both the Nexus and the army is the main way to screw up the attack.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because of how many units you can get out for a pre-10 minute attack. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Therefore, this build is a much more aggressive variant of the other Reaper expands possible in TvP.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that with such a low Marine count in the early game, fast Oracles can do a lot of damage if your scouting is not perfect.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,GoOutScv,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Barracks,SCV,DoubleMarines,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,DoubleMarines,OrbitalCommand,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,DoubleMarines,StimPack,Marine,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,CombatShield,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,Factory,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marauder,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,Starport,Refinery,ReactorOnFactory,EngineeringBay,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,CallMule,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,InfantryWeaponsLevel1', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:13 PM;

This build opens with some light Stalker pressure and then follows up with a 3gate Blink Stalker all-in, using the Mothership Core for high ground vision and Time Warp.

Blink into the main when Blink finishes (@7:40ish) with 12 Stalkers and 25 Probes at home.

Scouting

This build is an aggressive opener that makes a lot of units, so you will not have to worry about Probe scouting. Against Reaper play, keep your first Stalker on a common hop-up ledge in order to deny your opponent scouting the Twilight Council. Against other defensive play, poke out to your opponents front with your first Stalker and check to see whether your opponent is going for Widow Mines or a quick CC into Bio so you know how to micro when you Blink into his main base with all of your units.

Transitions

This build is an all-in, so there is no standard follow-up. If your attack does damage and you keep most of your units alive, then you can take a natural expansion and transition into Upgrades+Storm. However, if you do not do significant damage with your initial Stalkers and also lose them, you are most likely out of the game because your midgame tech and economy will be vastly behind that of your opponent.

Tips

- Do not bother Probe scouting, you can do this build against nearly everything your opponent chooses to open with.
- With your initial Stalkers, either protect your main base from a Reaper scouting your Twilight Council or move out and poke up at your opponents base for some early scouting intel.
- The limiting factor with this build is Blink Researchs build time, so be sure to Chronoboost that Research constantly in order to attack as soon as possible.
- Keep your Mothership Core out of harms way. Use its 14 sight range for high ground vision, but do not commit the Mothership Core in the attack because without high ground vision, your attack will most likely fail.
- Do not forget to use your Mothership Cores Time Warp ability to help pick off SCVs or Bio units that are out of position.
- Do NOT over-commit your Stalkers in a risky blink. Only aggressively blink to get up to a high ground or to pick off a Siege Tank/Widow Mine before it activates.
- Constantly warping-in more Stalkers to reinforce your army and add strength to the attack is key to crushing through your opponents defenses.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong build because of how quickly you get both high ground vision with your Mothership Core and enough Blink Stalkers to do real damage.

However, this build is in fact an all-in, so there is no standard transition should the attack fail.

This Reaper FE gets out a fast Factory so that you can defend any early Protoss pressure with Widow Mines and Bunkers. It then transitions into standard Bio play for a 10 minute Medivac attack.

Scouting

The very beginning of this build is somewhat fragile (opening with a Reaper FE means that you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper.  Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they expand (or note if they do not get a fast expansion by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play as you sacrifice your Reaper into your opponents base. If you are playing against a 1 basing Protoss, then constantly produce Widow Mines  do not just stop at 1. Also, if you do not know whether or not your opponent has built a Stargate, building a Bunker in your main mineral line for 4 Marines to sit in and shoot any early game Oracles is not a bad idea too.

Push out when your first set of Medivacs finish (@10:10ish) with 3 Medivacs, around 6 Marauders and 26 Marines, and 53 SCVs at home

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and Medivacs. After this build, get Concussive Shells, take a 3rd Command Center, continue your upgrades by getting and Armory and another Engineering Bay, build 2 more Barracks, and react to whatever midgame splash damage your opponent is getting. Against Colossi, get a 2nd Starport; against Storm, get a Ghost Academy.

Tips

- If you are not comfortable with pulling SCVs in and out of gas, then simply ignore the two notes telling you to pull an SCV out of and then later put one more into gas (at 15 and 22 supply).
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper.  Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), then continue making Widow Mines.  Also, consider moving your natural to your main base and defending on one base.
- Oracles massacre un-upgraded Marines, so position your Widow Mines effectively.  Also consider adding a Bunker in your mineral line if your opponent has a Stargate to further defend Oracle pressure.
- If your opponent is not playing aggressively, then drop your Widow Mine(s) and Marines at your opponents base.  Do not over commit if your opponent already has a detection/Cannons ready for you.
- This build gives you enough gas to start Marauder production much earlier than most other builds.  Be sure to ramp up your Marauder production early in order to make a beefier army than your opponent.
- Move out as soon as your Medivacs pop.  Stimpack, while not yet done, should finish by the time you get to your opponents base.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because it gives you the economy and infrastructure on par with a Wings of Liberty style 1rax FE. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Not to mention the fact that you start Widow Mine production very early in order to stay safe against any potential Protoss aggression.

However, this build is somewhat vulnerable to early Protoss pokes, especially if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that you start Stimpack a little later than other builds that go directly for Stimpack research, but you will still have Stimpack done for the 10 minute Medivac timing.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Bunker,SCV,DoubleMarines,GasScv,Factory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,Starport,WidowMine,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Medivac,CallMule,DoubleMarines,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Refinery,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnStarport,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,EngineeringBay,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,ScannerSweep,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,LiftStarportFromTechLab,LandRaxOnTechLab,LandRaxOnTechLab,StimPack,CombatShield,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnStarport,CallMule,SupplyDepot,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMedivacs,Marauder,CallMule,DoubleMarines,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Marauder,DoubleMarines,Marauder', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:14 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Scarlett Macro Mutalisk Style', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

The definitive macro build of modern ZvT, Scarlett?s fast 3 Hatch style quickly transitions into the most commonly used composition of Zergling, Baneling, Mutalisk. Utilizing a gasless opener with a high Queen count and fast upgrades, this is by far the best build with which to learn ZvT.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of very early force, make a few Zerglings to stay safe. However, do NOT overproduce early game units because this will slow down your 3 base saturation, and thus your midgame strength. Your next scout will be with an Overlord just after you start your +1/+1 (@7:15ish). This is merely to scout whether your opponent is opening with 3 base Bio play, 3 base Mech play, or a 2 base timing. If your opponent is going Mech, immediately abandon this build. Zerglings and Banelings are highly ineffective against Hellbats, Hellions, and Siege Tanks, so begin violently tech switching based off of Terran?s composition; Mutalisks for Tanks, Swarm Hosts for Hellbat Thor, etc. Continuing Mutalisk production is fine, but be sure to take a much earlier 5th base and Infestation Pit, as well as a Roach Warren. If your opponent is opening bio, proceed as the build dictates.

Transitions

As soon as you confirm that your opponent is going for a 3rd Command Center, feel free to start your 4th Hatchery. Against Mech play, transitioning into Swarm Hosts, Mutalisks, or Vipers is very strong. Against Bio/Mine play, transitioning into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk or mass Zergling/Baneling is also quite strong. Assuming you have not scouted Mech, your transition into standard Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk should serve you fine against any bio based composition. Emphasize Zerglings against Bio/Mine, Banelings against Bio/Hellbat, and Mutalisks against Marine/Tank.

Tips

- Be sure that you take map control with your initial Zerglings. Being able to spot when and with what your opponent moves out on the map can be crucial in defending any early timings.
- Metabolic Boost will not finish until just before 8 minutes with this build. If your opponent is hitting you very early, then a Spine Crawler and/or extra Queens will be more useful than slow Zerglings.
- As above, beware Reapers pressuring the Drone that attempts to take your 3rd base. You will have to defend it cautiously with Queens and your slower Zerglings. This is where creep spread will greatly assist you.
- Just after you start your +1/+1 upgrades, be sure to send a sacrificial Overlord into your opponent?s base to check whether your opponent is going for a Mech or Bio build.
- Against a Banshee based opener, over-produce Queens and conserve energy for Transfuses, without compromising either your creep spread or your injects too much.
- Be aware of the flow of each Terran composition. For example, Bio/Mine typically means non stop aggression, so usage of static defense to buy time and Mutalisks to intercept reinforcements is critical.
- Mutalisks are prioritized in this build over the other two components; Zerglings and Banelings. It is important to be as active with them as possible without compromising your macro.
- Against Bio/Mine, engage in small groups whenever possible to abuse the long cooldown of Widow Mines to the maximum effect.
- Against Bio/Hellbat/Thor, be sure to emphasize a ground army instead of a Mutalisk based composition. More Banelings and a faster hive are highly recommended, and be sure to fight on creep to get the best possible Baneling connections.
- Be aware of the standard creep clearing push that every bio Terran executes between 10 to 12 minutes, using their first two Medivacs, 15 to 25 Marines with Combat Shield/Stimpack, and the survivors of the Reaper/Hellion squad; be sure to have Banelings ready to defend, and surrender non essential creep tumors (any tumors placed upon paths he will not attack on).
- Using the Mutalisks to deny the fourth base as long as possible is critical to victory. Because you have made so many Mutalisks, your own Hive Tech will be delayed, so you must delay Terran as long as possible in turn.
- The build gets looser and more flexible as the game goes on, as is to be expected. As you are first trying out this build, you will either be far too greedy, and die with too many Drones, or far too safe, and die with not enough Drones. Constantly adjust the ratio of Drones to units based upon what you scout and the flow of the game, and learn the precise moments when you are completely free to Drone, and when you are not to maximize your success with this build.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong against almost all standard Terran openers. It gets 4 Queens for safety, injects, creep spread, and to defend a very quick 3rd Hatchery. With such a fast third, your midgame economy is also quite solid. This build is also currently viewed as the best way to play macro ZvT. It has no inherent weaknesses, and thus will always guarantee that the better player wins the game.
However, because you delay your Extractors in favor of 4 Queens, this build is not as safe against 1 Base all-ins than an opener that gets a very fast Metabolic Boost. Additionally, because you are opening gasless, Reaper openers have to be defended purely with Queens and your Terran opponent may be more inclined to play much greedier than he normally would against a gas opener.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Queen,InjectLarva,Queen,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Hatchery,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Overlord,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,EvolutionChamber,EvolutionChamber,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,MeleeAttacksLevel1,GroundCarapaceLevel1,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Lair,SpawnCreepTumor,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,BanelingNest,Drone,Hatchery,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Spire,PneumatizedCarapace,Hatchery,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,CentrifugalHooks,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,MeleeAtacksLevel2,GroundCarapaceLevel2,Overseer,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,FlyerCarapaceLevel1,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:14 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'sOs DT-Robo Expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with the fastest possible Dark Templar in order to keep your opponent pinned in their base as well as some light harass, while you safely transition into a 2 base economy and either a Robotics or Blink focused play.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker back to the protection of your Mothership Core quickly if you have to defend an early attack. Hold on with Photon Overcharge until you can warp-in a DT to defend as well as harass.

This build is surprisingly safe against most openings, so scouting is pretty minimal.

Against standard Robo expand builds, your Nexus will be a little bit later.  You can make up for this either by using Warp Prism/DT harass or doing a Blink follow up to abuse their low production capability.

Against Blink play, simply take advantage of their lack of detection and kill a bunch of Probes. Against Dark Templar play, use your Observer and Stalker to push back their DTs while your(s) kill a bunch of Probes.

Against Stargate play, you might run into some problems. Phoenix will be able to scout what you are doing, and Oracles provide detection as well as harass potential.

Transitions

This build sets you up with a 2 base economy and both a Robotics Facility and Twilight Council. This lets you transition into either midgame Blink timings or Chargelot/Archon/Immortal macro play very easily.

To transition into Blink play, start and chronoboost Blink from your Twilight Council as soon as your first Dark Templar is warped in. Go up to 5 Gateways on 2 Assimilators and warp-in Blink Stalkers non-stop at your opponents base in order to punish typically greedy play in reaction to DT expand builds.

To transition into Chargelot/Archon/Immortal play, start Immortal production, a Forge, and go up to 3 Gateways. Once you are safely in the midgame, start Charge and be sure to out-expand your opponent.

Tips

- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial Stalker to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Traps 3gate All-in).
- You may want to proxy 2 Pylons with this build. One for the initial hidden Dark Shrine. The second for a close warp-in location for your initial DT.
- Un-chronoboosted Warpgate will time out perfectly with your Dark Shrine finishing
- Against Stargate play, be sure to position your initial units to defend your mineral line from potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- In the midgame, spend all of your Chronoboost on either the Robotics Facility or Twilight Councildepending on your transition.

Pros and Cons

This build is a reasonably safe build that allows you harass potential as well as forces your opponent to stay at home. It also expands at a normal time in order to get to the midgame quickly and transition smoothly into either a fast timing or macro play.

However, this build is somewhat weak against early Stargate play, for the Stargate allows for Oracles to both harass and detect and Phoenix to take map control.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,WarpgateUpgrade,MothershipCore,TwilightCouncil,Probe,Pylon,Probe,DarkShrine,Probe,Pylon,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Nexus,Probe,Observer,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,WarpInDarkTemplar', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:14 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Roach-Bane All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Roach/Baneling all-in takes advantage of greedy Terran play by hitting a Terran before his midgame infrastructure can be set up with a huge swell of Roaches and Banelings.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of very early force, make a few Speedlings to stay safe. However, do NOT overproduce early game units because this will slow down your push.
Your next scout will be with an Overlord as soon as you start your Roach Warren (around 6:30). This is merely to scout whether your opponent is opening with Hellbats. If he is, then do not produce more than 1 wave of Banelings ? favor Roaches to defend your Drones at home as you attack the front with the same push.
The next scout will be with your initial Roach Warren attack. Try to force a Widow Mine to detonate with a Speedling or two before you commit to the attack. Also, with your all-in, you will see what units your opponent has because all of them must be at the front in order to defend.

Transitions

Because this build is an all-in, there is no true transition to this build. However, once you destroy at least one base of SCVs, you can transition out of the attack and get economically ahead. Drone up your 3rd base and continue into a macro game, instead of pushing up the main ramp in a potentially bad engagement.
If you do choose to drone up, start 2 Evolution Chambers and a Lair instantly, along with your 3rd and 4th Extractors. You?ll likely want +1 Melee over +1 Ranged, though you have the option to transition into any composition involving any combination of Zerglings/Banelings/Roaches that you are most comfortable with.
The obvious transition would be to hit a follow-up push on 3 bases with +1 Melee and +1 Carapace, with both Roach and Baneling Speed. This should hit around 13:30, only 3:30 later than a straight 3base Lair tech Roach/Baneling bust.

Tips

- Hide your Roaches for as long as possible before you move out. The less time you give your opponent to react to your build, the better your chance at crushing through their front.
- Make a bunch of Overlords BEFORE you need to make all of your units. Making Overlords during a fight is a sure way to get supply blocked.
- Use Banelings to bust a wall at the natural. Then, all high priority Baneling targets are: packs of Marines/SCVs, researching Tech labs, and the central structure on the top of the ramp.
- Do NOT over commit your Roaches if you are waiting on a second wave of Banelings to morph. It is completely fine to pull back whilst you wait for another round of Banelings. Zerglings and Banelings can be replaced; your Roaches cannot.
- Do NOT over commit up your opponent?s main ramp unless you are absolutely sure that you can push through and win the game with the attack. Favor droning up your 3rd base and transitioning into a macro game over potentially taking a bad engagement up the main ramp.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any player going for a Tank-less 3 Command Center build (the current metagame). Also, because you take your third base before moving out, it is easy to stop Zergling/Baneling production and saturate your third base in order to transition into a standard 3 base Zerg vs 2 base Terran macro game. Also, as a Zerg player, the engagement itself is quite easy to micro.
However, if you cannot do damage with the Roach/Bane attack, then you will be economically behind the Terran opponent. Also, because it is an all-in, this build is quite difficult to transition out of.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Drone,SpawningPool,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,MetabolicBoost,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Queen,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,RoachWarren,Extractor,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Overlord,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,SpawnCreepTumor,BanelingNest,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:14 PM;

This DT rush opens with a 3 Stalker Rush for safety and map control, and then gets out fast DTs either for offense (taking advantage of your opponent?s possible lack of detection early on) or defense (applying pressure while you safely take an expansion of your own).

Scouting

This build is a pretty unsafe build in general, only giving you 3-5 units for the early game timings, thus scouting is huge. However, because this build was created by SaSe, you are also low on minerals for quite some time and thus cannot afford losing mining time by scouting with a Probe.  Therefore, in the early game merely scout in your base for a proxy Gateway with the Probe who builds the 2nd Pylon; the rest of your scouting will come from your 3 Stalkers. Being active with these 3 Stalkers around your natural, third, and watchtower will prevent your opponent from sneaking proxy Pylons past you and hitting you with a very early Gateway attack. Thus, you will be able to see an incoming push coming before it?s too late, and can delay/cancel your fast expand in favor of more units if you need to.

Transitions

This build transitions very smoothly into Chargelot/Archon builds or Blink Stalker builds. To make either transition, first resume chronoboosting out probes from both Nexi and then start your research of choice (Charge or Blink). Adding on 2 more Gateways, and applying midgame pressure with lots of Gateways and 1 or 2 Archons is a great way to force units out of your opponent, scout what midgame tech he?s going, and possibly end the game if your DTs did too much damage.

Pros and Cons

This build is great because it gets a reasonably timed expansion, gives you DTs early for map control and potential game-ending damage, and lets you transition into an aggressive midgame with either Chargelots or Blink Stalkers at the core of your army composition.
However, this build is very weak vs Oracle openers, for they give both detection and a great way to harass your naked mineral line. Also, against early attacks that hit before your Dark Shrine finishes, if you miss the proxy Pylon because you are not active enough with your first three stalkers, you can straight up lose the game.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'TaeJa 1-1-1 Cloakshee', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This aggressive build used by Liquid`TaeJa and many other top level Korean Terrans opens with a very standard Banshee build adapted to Heart of the Swarm and the cheaper Banshee Cloak upgrade. The Banshees are used to stay safe against early attacks as well as harass your opponent.

This build is VERY closely related to Polts Gas First Banshee Build  TaeJas version is just a Barracks first variant of Polts build.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your 1st Refinery to check whether or not your opponent is opening with Reapers. Against an opponent opening Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe; thus, you should try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or expanded at your natural with your first few Marines.

Your next scout will come with your Banshee. With this Banshee, you can check what your opponents opener is. Against another Banshee player, follow-up your first Banshee with a Raven (and then potentially Viking if extra anti-air is needed). Against a Hellbat dropping player, make a few Widow Mines to burrow defensively against any incoming drop, as you use several Banshees to out-harass him. Against a player going for a Widow Mine Drop, position your Marines defensively at home and be sure to have enough scans to deal with his Widow Mines. Building a Raven might be useful, but not until after you have 2 Banshees with which to harass your opponent.

Finally, be sure to keep an eye out on what midgame transition your opponent is doing. Look for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either all-in, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play quite easily.

For an all-in transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory and start Siege Tank production instantly. When you hit 2 or 3 Siege Tanks, grab all of your Marines (>20), your Banshees/Vikings, and attempt to break your opponents front with a slow siege push.

It is possible to go into Marine/Tank or Mech after a 3 Command Center follow-up if you are sure your opponent will not be going for any more early game pressure. Start a Raven in order to save enough minerals to afford 2 Command Centers and then transition into either Marine/Tank or Mech just as below.

When transitioning into macro Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production after you start a 2nd Command Center. That way you have enough defense early and later can have a strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy Siege Tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use.
- Watch for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop your Banshee as you enter your opponents base.  Cloak your Banshee as soon as you see any potential for burrowed Widow Mines.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that are undefended by a Turret.  If you are transitioning to a 1/1/1 all-in, then be sure to target-fire Marines as well.
- Always favor keeping your Banshee(s) alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two. You can also repair a weakened Banshee at home with SCVs if you can keep it alive.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural. You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This build is a standard, aggressive opener in TvT that both scouts and stays safe in the early game. Also, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for you are able to transition into an all-in, 3 Command Center play, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play. Also, this build requires a lot less APM than other TvT builds, so it can be very useful for lower league players.

However, this build is not quite as effective at killing workers as a Widow Mine Drop into Banshee build. Also, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind your opponent in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades, especially if they open with a fast expansion. Finally, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,Factory,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Refinery,SCV,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Starport,ReactorOnBarracks,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,CallMule,SCV,LandStarportOnTechLab,CloakingField,DoubleMarines,Banshee,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:14 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Speedling All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Speedling all-in is a cheese designed to hard and blind-counter a Gateway Expanding Protoss player in the current metagame. It also has varying success against a FFE, depending on your opponent?s building placement.

Scouting

You only need to Drone scout for the Protoss on a 4 player map such as Whirlwind or Red City. Your early Spawning Pool prevents you from having the minerals to scout with a Drone on any other map. Instead of scouting with your units, the vast majority of your scouting will come from your initial Overlords? vision. Also, you do not need to scout for any Protoss cheeses because cheese should counter any of their cheeses quite effectively.

Transitions

Because this build is straight-up cheese, there is no true transition to this build. However, if you do damage and want to continue into a macro game, take a natural Hatchery and start a 2nd Queen to play a 2base, map control play style.

Tips

- Position your Overlords to give you vision of your opponent?s walls. Attacking the holes in your opponent?s building placement is crucial with this build, but that can only be easily done once you have vision of these holes.
- Use your initial 6 Zerglings to do as much damage as possible, along with scouting the Protoss for unusual play.
Avoid placing your Zerglings in a position where they can be surrounded by Probes and/or Zealots. Always retreat and poke in another area instead of committing to a bad position to get a guaranteed kill on a single target.
- Avoid a-clicking with your Zerglings. Rather, pick a target, move behind it to surround it, and then attack-move or target-fire the individual unit for a quick kill.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any Protoss player going for a Gateway Expand (the current metagame).  It is designed to do potentially game-winning damage against any player with sub-optimal building placement and Probe control.
However, it is significantly weaker against a Forge Fast Expanding player, for your Zerglings can only do damage where there are no Photon Cannons or wall-offs.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Extractor,Drone,Overlord,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn5Seconds,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MetabolicBoost,Queen,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:14 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Taeja Autoturret Doom Drop', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

Though it has fallen out of popularity, this once dominant build still remains as powerful as ever. Utilizing a gas first opening to stay safe against an opponents gas first aggression, this build gets a fast two Medivacs to violently drop 8 Marines, 2 Siege Tanks, and 3 Auto Turrets in a critical position of the enemys base.

Scouting

Taeja chooses only to scout with his Hellion, preserving all his SCVs for maximum income. At times, he cannot afford continuous Marine or SCV production in the demonstration replay; had he SCV scouted he would be even more pushed for minerals.

SCV scouting is definitely an option if you do not feel safe enough with the delayed hellion scout, but it should be relegated to a 4:30 scout at the very earliest so as to not delay your Starport in any way.

Transitions

This build can transition into both Bio or Mech. Because you have made no major investments down either tech path, and you have exactly one of each necessary production structure, you can literally go into whatever style you want.

Tips

Against a live resisting opponent, execution of this build may run into some problems. They could be opening banshees; forcing Turrets to be made just before you move out. They could be doing the exact same build, resulting in a base trade. They could be doing earlier aggression that pins you in your base for longer than youd like, such as an elevator attack or a doom drop.

There are reactions to each of these plays, and there are far too many to list here. Regardless of what happens though, sometimes it is important to identify that you are more ahead simply by staying home and defending, and not to blindly commit to the attack every single game. This will come by experience and repeatedly executing the build.

Three main consistencies must be maintained;

1) You MUST continue unit production behind this attack; you cannot start a big transition (adding on Barracks/Factories while freezing production by constructing addons) else you will be extremely vulnerable to a counter attack. The only exception is when you know with certainty that your opponent will not be performing some sort of counterattack (for example, he has gone 3 Barracks into delayed Factory, or he has gone for a elevator and youve already killed the medivacs beforehand).

2) Once your autoturrets are dropped, its almost always a good idea to fly the Raven home; it will prove useful in the mid game.

3) If they made Banshees, you have to make turrets before moving out, else risk losing the game. Delay this to the last possible moment, as you are already pressed for cash.

Pros and Cons

The lethality of this build cannot be understated; you can simply win most games with this drop, especially against players who have gone for more macro oriented builds, such as a Reaper FE or a 15 gas style.

Unfortunately, if your opponent identifies your build quickly enough and prepositions his units properly, or employs defensive AOE such as Tanks or Widow Mines, your drop may end up doing little to no damage, and you can easily die to a counter push or drop.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,SCV,Factory,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Starport,Refinery,SCV,TechLabOnFactory,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,Hellion,SCV,LandStarportOnTechLab,Raven,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,LiftStarportFromTechLab,LandFactoryOnTechLab,SiegeTank,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,Medivac,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SiegeTank,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Medivac,SCV,OrbitalCommand', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:14 PM;

This build opens with a Forge Fast Expand and then utilizes everything the Twilight Council has to offer in order to all-in your opponent. This two base all-in gets +2 attack, DTs, and mass Blink Stalkers to crush your opponent before the late game.

Scouting

After any early game shenanigans are ruled out, as you have spotted your opponent?s third Hatchery going down, then there is no need for any scouting besides what you see with your two pokes.

When you move out with your first 3 units (Zealot, Stalker, and Mothership Core), go to Zerg?s third base and see if you can pick off a queen and force some units. If your opponent reveals that he has Roaches already, then instantly pull back and stay behind your wall until your next poke with the DTs.  Expect a Roach defense vs your Blink Stalkers. If your opponent only shows slow Zerglings, then know that your opponent delayed gas and most likely has a larger economy than normal. Expect a lot more units vs your Blink Stalkers. If your opponent shows Speedlings, then pull back and stay behind your wall until your next poke with the DTs. Expect a Roach/Ling or Hydra/Ling defense vs your Blink Stalkers.

When you send your DTs to each base of your opponent, be on the look out for what units he has to defend, or what tech structures he has built. Your push is just about to happen, so it is too late to react in any way, but it is nice to know what units you will be up against before you are actually fighting them head on.

Transitions

This build is an all-in, so there is no true transition out of it. Simply keep reinforcing with your +2 Blink Stalkers (chronoboost your Gateways when you can) until your opponent is forced to leave or your army gets crushed.

If you do not win, but see that your opponent has way too much Roach or Hydra or Roach/Hydra for you to defeat, consider falling back onto a 3rd Nexus, and starting double Robotics Colossi production as a desperation move.

Tips

- Spend all of your early game chronoboost on your Nexii to maximize Probe production.
- Because you are getting your +1 Attack so early, there is no need to chronoboost it very often. Prioritize Probes instead.
- Do not over commit with your first three units. The Zealot can be killed, but if at all possible, retreat with your Stalker and Mothership Core still alive.
- Hide the Twilight Council (and later Dark Shrine) somewhere in your base that is less likely to be scouted by an Overlord.
- Keep a Probe hidden somewhere on the map before you are ready to move out. Being able to place a nice proxy Pylon for the DTs and then later Stalker warp-ins can be the difference between an easy win and a tough loss.
- Obviously, during the fight itself, utilize Blink to save the weakest Stalkers and keep your army alive.

Pros and Cons

This build is a solid all-in that utilizes everything the Twilight Council has to offer. It is a 1-2-3 punch sort of build, first hitting with your initial 3 units, then the DTs, and then the Blink Stalkers, so it keeps Zergs on their toes.

However, because this build is so reliant on the Twilight Council, your opponent flying in an overlord and spotting this will tip them off to everything that you are building; it is very easy to scout (Note: just because it is easy to scout does NOT mean it is easy to defend). Also, it is an all-in, so assuming you do not succeed in crushing your opponent with the Blink Stalkers, there is very little chance you have of coming back into the game. Finally, because this build packs a 1-2-3 punch, it is a more mechanically difficult build than other choices and is not suggested for newer players.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,GoOutProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Nexus,Forge,Pylon,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Chronoboost,PhotonCanon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,GroundWeaponsLevel1,Zealot,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,MothershipCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Stalker,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,TwilightCouncil,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Blink,DarkShrine,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,GroundWeaponsLevel2,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInDarkTemplar,WarpInDarkTemplar,WarpInDarkTemplar,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:14 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Trap 3gate All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This hyper-aggressive 3gate all-in opens with a Gateway on 10 supply in order to get the fastest Warpgate Research possible. It then hits a ridiculously early (@5:30ish) 3gate attack in order to end the game before leaving the early game.

Scouting

This build requires very minimal scouting, for you are placing your initial Gateway at 10 supply?long before any scouting information could influence your build. However, it is critical to send a Probe out to set up proxy Pylon(s) BEFORE your Warpgate is done. Thus, probe scouting to check whether your opponent has opened with a 3 Stalker Rush in order to deny proxy Pylons can yield useful information.

Transitions

This build is an all-in in every respect: getting a 10 Gateway, non-stop chronoboosting Warpgate, halting Probe production at 16 (on minerals), and dumping all money into Gateway units. Thus, there is no well-defined transition. If you are late in your execution and do not outright kill your opponent (or at least take out their army and 10+ Probes), then you will most likely lose the game to any sort of Robotics/Twilight/Stargate counter-attack.

Tips

- Use only 1 Chronoboost on Probes (as you resume Probe production after your 10 Gateway).
- Use 1 Chronoboost on your Zealot in order to finish it as your Cybernetics Core finishes.
- ALL THE REST OF YOUR CHRONOBOOST MUST BE DUMPED INTO WARPGATE RESEARCH. The limiting factor on this build is how fast you can finish Warpgate. Be sure to non-stop chronoboost your Cybernetics Core until it finishes researching so as to attack as early as possible.
- There is a slightly more aggressive/less economic version of this build that opens with a 15 Zealot, 17 Pylon, and never chronoboosts the Zealot. That build and this build can be used interchangeably based on personal preference.
- Place your proxy Pylons quite aggressively for your attack to hit as fast as possible, unless you need to hide your proxy Pylon from a 3 Stalker rushing player.
- Commit to the attack as quickly as possible and never stop warping-in Zealots and Stalkers until either you have won the game or you have lost all of your units. The strength of this all-in is how quickly and ferociously it attacks, but if you are not constantly attacking then your opponent?s economic/tech advantage can destroy you.

Pros and Cons

This build is a hyper-aggressive all-in that is able to get 5 Stalkers and 1 Zealot warped-in at your opponent?s base at 5:30. Because of how quickly this build attacks, it can punish most greedy PvP builds with ease.
Unfortunately, this all-in is quite easy to scout because you cannot hide the fact that you are getting your first Gateway and Cybernetics Core much earlier than the normal timing. However, it being easy to scout and easy to defend are two fundamentally different things, so you can still win with this build quite often.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Pylon,Zealot,Chronoboost,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Stalker,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:14 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'TLO 2 Base Muta', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with an economic 2 base Muta opener, and uses a 7:20 Overlord scout coupled with the initial Mutalisk harass to determine whether your Terran opponent is using a Bio-based composition, or a Mech-based composition.

Scouting

Scout first with your 2 initial Zerglings, use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of the Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of force very early, you will probably need emergency Spine Crawlers ? your Metabolic Boost will only be finishing around 8:20!
Your next scout will be with an Overlord as soon as your Lair finishes (around 7:05).  With this scout, aim to check if your opponent is playing Mech or Bio. Seeing any of the following can indicate Mech play: an Armory, more than 1 Factory, a Factory with Tech Lab, a lack of Barracks, or a lack of add-ons on Barracks. Seeing any of the following can indicate Bio play: 2 Engineering Bays, a Barracks with a researching Tech lab, more than 1 Barracks, or only one Factory.  If you scout Bio, you can still continue with a 2 base Spire timing and transition into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk OR you can abort the 2 base Spire timing and throw down 2 Evolution Chambers as soon as possible for +1/+1 Melee/Carapace upgrades.
The next scout will be with your initial Mutalisks. Terran will be forced to defend himself with his units, so you?ll see either Bio or Mech units to defend. These Mutalisks should be able to get into his main quite easily and scout what type of production he is using, perhaps even doing some economic damage.

Transitions

If you confirm Mech play with your Mutalisks, throw down an Infestation Pit. If you are sure he is going Mech before your Mutalisks arrive, then you can even place the Infestation Pit as soon as your Mutalisks hatch. Add more bases and Swarm Hosts when you can afford them.  Swarm Hosts are a strong option as your initial Mutalisks will likely force Turrets, Thors, and Widow Mines?units that are generally not strong against Swarm Host play. Alternatively, you can go into Overlord Speed and drop-play, to abuse the lack of Terran mobility. Finally, you can also place your Hive as soon as possible and go for a follow-up Brood Lord transition.
If you confirm Bio play with your Mutalisks, throw down 2 Evolution Chambers and a Baneling Nest as soon as possible. Note that you will be behind in upgrades against a 3 base macro Terran player, but you can recuperate this loss by aiming to snipe a key Tech lab researching Stimpack or Combat Shields, as this can prevent Terran from being aggressive with his upgrade lead. Good creep spread and strong engagements/burrowed Banelings can also mitigate this upgrade deficit. Once you hit the lategame, you have the option to transition into your preferred Hive tech.

Tips

- If you place a 5:00-5:30 Spine Crawler, you should be able to stop Hellions made from a Factory started before your opponent?s 2nd base. A 6:00-6:30 Spine Crawler will finish in time to stop Hellions made after your opponent?s 2nd base or Hellions made after a Reaper opener.
- Just when your Lair finishes (7:20ish), ideally you should be fully saturated on your 2 bases with extra minerals going into additional Drones. However, there are a couple of defensive options available if you are under pressure: If you have extra Drones and want to completely deter Hellion runbys, then make a wall-off with 2 Evolution Chambers and your Spine Crawler at the front of your natural.This will not slow down your Mutalisk timing as long as you remain fully saturated on all mineral lines and Extractors. Alternatively, you also have the ability to make a large group of Zerglings (only if you need to defend yourself) without hurting the timing of the Mutalisks. Note that you should only do this if you absolutely have to because droning should always be a priority. Remember that Metabolic Boost will only finish around 8:20, so any Zerglings made before this point should be used strictly for defense.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against Mech players. The initial Mutalisks will force extra Missile Turrets, Thors, and Widow Mines ? units that are all not ideal against the large mass of Swarm Hosts that you should follow-up with.
If you scout your opponent opening Bio with your Mutalisk timing, then you can transition into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk. The obvious problem here is that you will be behind on upgrades, but again this is not game-ending provided you get strong, cost-efficient engagements on creep. Also, this build is vulnerable to large Marine attacks in the early-game because you will not have Metabolic Boost yet to defend them. Hopefully, however, you can scout this coming with your initial Zerglings and/or Overlord in order to stay safe with Spine Crawlers.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Queen,Overlord,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Lair,Extractor,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,MetabolicBoost,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Spire,Overlord,Overlord,Hatchery,Queen,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,SpawnCreepTumor,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:14 PM;

This build uses a fast +1 Carapace upgrade to secure a fast 3rd Base and deny opposing 3rds before it transitions into a swift +1/+1 Speed Roach timing and eventual +2/+1.

Scouting

In the early stages of the game, all scouting comes from Overlord vision, so be sure that you send your initial 2 Overlords towards your opponent?s natural expansion. You can use your Overlord to compare his Hatchery?s HP to yours, to determine what kind of opener he used. If his hatchery is stronger than yours, he has gone hatchery first. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is the same HP as yours, he has VERY LIKELY done the same build as you. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is weaker to yours, he has gone for a gas and pool before hatchery in some order, meaning his speed is quicker than yours. Banelings before speed in this scenario is often advised, and likely make the Baneling nest in the main to not lose your Baneling tech to mass Zerglings with speed. An alternative is to not use your Gas, and get extra Queens and 2-3 Spine Crawlers. The main theme here is to not get Speed first, as his WILL be quicker. You need to find an edge that isn?t using Zergling Speed.
When playing versus any very early aggression (<10 pool), use your Drones to defend until you have your own Zerglings, a Queen, and potentially a Spine Crawler. Consider canceling the Hatchery for more minerals. Also use your initial overlord to scout when your opponent is taking their natural Hatchery. Feel free to apply some light pressure with your first Zerglings against a Hatch first build, but do not let it mess up your macro.
Make sure you have 2 to 4 Zerglings out on the map at all times. Send your initial 2 Zerglings to your opponent?s base to spot what they have at the front, and if possible get into the main with 1 Ling to see whether your hatching Drones or Zerglings from their eggs. Use the scouting intel that these pokes give you to determine whether you should get Banelings and extra Zerglings to defend yourself or pressure your opponent, or whether you should continue droning.
If your scout Zerglings see Drones hatching, and no wall at the front, you can choose to make Drones OR Zerglings to pressure. If you scout Zerglings, and no wall at the front, you should make the same amount of Zerglings. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings escape, send them back in to scout in 20~ seconds. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings die, remake the scout. Consider another 2 Zerglings for just-in-case Banelings. If you scout a wall, the Zerg is likely playing passive and you are likely safe.
As soon as you are sure you are safe, transition into your choice of tech.

Transitions

This has best synergy with a Hydralisk transition, which is possible after taking gas numbers 5 and 6 at your third base, although you could flood earlier Speedlings with +1 Carapace. However, you have the option of simply researching +1 Melee upgrades to transition into upgraded Speedlings, which is excellent against Mutalisk openers, or even going for a delayed Spire.

Tips

If your opponent is also going for a Roach based composition, remember that Roach Battles are mostly determined by macro and concaves. The superior concave will allow a smaller force to defeat a larger one, for the most part ? this is because more Roaches can fight in a larger concave, although you can also rush forward to allow the ones in the back to attack.
Against a Mutalisk based player, be sure to scout to see how many Mutalisks your opponent is making. If he is only making a few Mutalisks to dictate the pace of the game and force spores, you will probably be able to get away with only making Queens and Spores. If your opponent is heavily committing to Mutalisks, then consider incorporating Hydralisks and Infestors earlier than you normally would, in addition to the standard Queens and Spores. Spore Crawlers should also be placed to cover your Extractors, to ensure you do not fall behind tech wise. Do not be afraid to delay your Roach Timing if you are not sure how your opponent is going to play it out.
Against an upgraded Speedling force, delay your timing until you are maxed out. If your opponent invests very heavily into melee and carapace upgrades, they are almost certainly transitioning into an Ultralisk focused composition.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very flexible opener, which can combat greedier defensive play and also more aggressive play if your defensive micro is strong.
Because you are opening +1 Carapace Speedlings, taking and defending your third should relatively straightforward. Additionally, you have the opportunity of being reactive; the infrastructure you have at Lair level (+1 Carapace, Roach Warren, Metabolic Boost) allow you to choose between +1/+1 Speedlings, +1+1 Roaches, or even a slightly delayed Mutalisk transition.
However, this build by default will skip the Baneling nest in favor of faster upgrades and Lair Tech, so it is important to be on point with your scouting to avoid dying to enemy Baneling/Speedling aggression. If your scouting is poor, consider opening instead with the Safe Ling/Bling Opener, which will teach you what to look for and give you the tools to defend with.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Overlord,Extractor,Drone,Queen,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Queen,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,EvolutionChamber,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GroundCarapaceLevel1,Hatchery,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Lair,InjectLarva,RoachWarren,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Extractor,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GlialReconstitution,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:32:14 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'YoDa Repaer FE into Mine Drop to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE opens with a strong economy, and then transitions into constant harass with a Widow Mine drop follow-up.

Scouting

This build is reasonably safe against most your opponent can open with as long as you are smart with your two Reapers.  Use them for scouting by poking at your opponents front in order to determine what your opponent can or cannot be doing as well as potentially killing a Marine or SCV.  Against Reaper play, keep your Reapers more defensively positioned.

Transitions

This build can transition into Marine/Tank or Mech very easily. However you cannot transition into Bio/Hellbat because you have not invested any time into getting the early game Bio upgrades.

When transitioning into Marine/Tank, start your tank production soon, using the Widow Mines and Reapers to stay safe as well as apply pressure. As your Medivac is moving out, swap your Barracks onto the Factorys Reactor and start double Marine production, add on a Tech lab onto your Factory to start Siege Tank production, and build two more Barracks and a third Refinery as soon as you can afford it to complete your 2 base infrastructure.

When transitioning into Mech, again you must rely on the Widow Mines and Reapers to stay safe and apply pressure, but this time back at home you must be playing greedily. You can dump your money into a 3rd base while your Medivac is moving out. Once youve started 3 bases, getting 2 more Factories, all your Refineries, and a decent Siege Tank count is your obvious next move. YoDa likes to also make a Tech lab on his Starport to get Ravens, but this is a stylistic choice that you dont have to make.

Pros and Cons

This build is great because it gives you a good economy and gives you lots of map control with the early game Reapers/Widow Mines. The harass you can apply is incredibly effective if you split up your Widow Mines effectively throughout your opponents base.

However, it is somewhat vulnerable to Banshee play, so be sure to position your Widow Mines defensively against Banshees. Also, with poor Medivac control, you can very easily lose your Medivac and all the Widow Mines if you fly directly into a Viking or Marine pack. Be sure to prioritize keeping the Medivac alive above all else.

Chrono on probes up to the 18 supply chrono. Continue chronoing probes when you know youre safe.

From the point it leaves off its up to you to decide what you want to do. You can go into twilight tech for immortal/archon to do a +2 timing or go into passive colossus play.

Like the name suggests, the opening is extremely safe and versatile. Early aggression is completely thwarted with this build as you get an early Sentry and MSCore to defend proxy oracles or gateway pressure. The 4 extra units that you get out of the gateways before expanding really deny any sort of early 3 or 4gate attacks while the MSCore defends vs phoenix and oracle play. The only thing youll need to be careful with is DT openers since the robo is a little bit late compared to other builds. You should be able to get an idea that DTs will be coming though after seeing little to no unit production with your probe scout and maybe even the twilight council if youre diligent enough. In that case you can get the robo before your nexus if you want to be safe, however with 2 forcefields and stalkers to block the ramp you should be able to stall until your observer is out.

Make sure you remember to use your hallucination scout at 6 minutes to know exactly what youre up against. If you see them playing passively you can skip a 3rd gate and get a much faster forge to be ahead on them in upgrades. You also dont need to warp in anything when WG is done if you see them playing passively, it would just be a waste of resources that dont do anything. You only want to be making units when you need to be or have the money to in PvP. If they out greed you in the opener you need to find ways to out greed them in the follow up.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '1 Rax FE into 2 Medivac Push', @SC2VersionID = '2.0.5', @Description = 'General Overview

This 1rax FE build gives you a strong economy, while staying safe from early Protoss pressure. It then transitions into a strong 10 minute push with +1 attack, Stim, Combat Shields, Concussive shells, and 2 Medivacs.

Scouting

When you send your scouting SCVs, you want to look for gasses, nexus energy, and the units he is producing out of his gateway. If he only has 1 gas before his stalker pops, check to see whether your opponent gets his natural at around 5:15 (You can hide your SCV nearby and then run it in around 5:30) to check for an expansion later if need be. If he has 2 gas and you don?t scout an expansion by 6:00, then be wary of an all-in. The common responses to standard Protoss plays are:
- Nexus First: Bunker rush with 4 Barracks instead of getting your 2nd CC OR Stop making marines at 3, get your 3rd CC and go straight into double upgrades to get a leg up in the macro game.
- Double Gas, No Expansion by 6:00: Get 3 bunkers (and a missile turret if you haven?t ruled out DTs). Pull SCVs to repair and provide a meat shield as necessary.
- 1 Gate Expand: Play normal.

Tips

- To confirm that your opponent is not allining you, have an SCV (or scan) go to his natural just before the 6 minute mark. A 4gate will hit before this timing, but 1 bunker and repair should be able to hold a 4gate easily enough; all other scary allins hit much later and this scout will give you enough time to prepare an appropriate defense.
- Unless you are expecting an allin of some sort, do not make marauders until you?ve started your starport. The 50 gas from making 2 marauders at a time will slow down the push by over a minute.
- Also related to this, you can push your medivac timing earlier by getting your factory before your barracks addons. Because you?re not making marauders just yet anyway, the only difference between getting the addons before factory vs getting them after is that you cut a couple of marines and get a faster medivac timing. Both versions are totally valid.
- Once you have your first marauder out, take your own watchtower by scaring away or killing his stalker ? up until you get a marauder out, you have to stay behind your bunker for defense.
- When you attack with your first 2 medivacs, be sure to scan your opponent?s natural in order to determine how much stuff/how many sentries he has waiting for you. If your opponent has too many units, then double drop the main instead of attacking directly into the natural.  Do NOT engage in chokes against sentries.

Transitions

As you?re pushing out, you will need to place down your 3rd CC, 2nd engibay and armory, 2 more rax, and a ghost academy or 2nd starport to counter your opponent?s HTs or collosi. If you?re feeling safe, then place down the 3rd CC and engibay first. If you?re worried about not having enough units, get the 2 more rax earlier, as well as possibly your ghost academy or 2nd starport before 3rd. Transition into 3 base bio with ghosts/vikings when you have the money.

Pros and Cons

This is probably the most standard 1rax FE. Compared to the other variants, it gives you reasonably timed infrastructure, a very safe opening against most 1 base and early 2 base Protoss all-ins, and of course the exact same economy as the other 1rax FEs.  However, early on you have no map control at all because of how well early stalkers can deal with naked marines in the open field; you don?t get up your 3rd CC extremely fast; and you don?t get up your 5 barracks up as quickly as Bomber?s build.
Other TvP builds, besides the 1rax FE variants, should also be considered. This build gives you a lot smaller army and much later upgrades than MKP?s 2rax early on, in exchange for a much stronger economy and a solid timing attack with Medivacs at around the 10 minute mark. Also, it gives you more scans and SCVs to pull to deal with early DTs and/or pressure. While the 2rax will attack early and hit hard with continued aggression, the 1rax FE will give you a much more powerful attack later on, in exchange for leaving you more vulnerable against the early aggression Protoss can lay on.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,CommandCenter,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,Bunker,Marine,SCV,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Refinery,Refinery,SCV,Marine,CallMule,Marine,Marine,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,Marine,SCV,SCV,Marine,SupplyDepot,StimPack,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Marine,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Factory,EngineeringBay,Refinery,Marine,Marine,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,CombatShield,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Marauder', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:35:26 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '2 Base Speedling Timing', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build appears to be a standard Zerg opener to the untrained eye, but it actually can outright kill most unrefined Terran macro builds in the lower leagues.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. Do your best to stop your opponent from scouting how many Zerglings you are creating. The rest of your scouting will come from your Speedling timing attack. Check whether your opponent is going for a Bio, Mech, or 3CC play. You should at the least be able to force your opponent to lift off their natural unless they made a tight wall ? don?t commit your Speedlings into a meat grinder if your opponent has walled off successfully.

Transitions

As soon as you hit your attack, you need to be droning quite heavily to be able to stand any sort of chance going into the midgame. Only put Drones back in gas and re-begin teching up to Lair, Evolution Chambers, and Mutalisks once you are getting closer to 2 base Drone saturation.

Tips

- Be sure that you take map control with your initial Zerglings. Being able to deny your opponent vision of your building Zerglings will make this attack that much stronger.
- Do NOT attack into a Terran force behind a full wall-off. Force your opponent to abandon their natural and continue droning up.

Pros and Cons

This build looks like a standard ZvT build, but hits your opponent incredibly aggressively with a lot of early game Speedlings. This Speedling timing should either outright win the game or give you an effective economic advantage that will take you into the midgame. However, because you are cutting Drone production in order to support this swell of Zerglings, your economic situation will be much further behind than what you might be used to. If your opponent holds the attack without taking much damage at all, then it?s possible you will simply get rolled over by any sort of counterattack as you are attempting to make Drones.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Extractor,Drone,SpawningPool,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,StartIdle,StopIdleIn5Seconds,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Queen,MetabolicBoost,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:35:26 PM;

VortiX uses a gasless opening and transitions into a strong Roach Zergling timing, aiming to punish greedier Roach play or swift Mutalisk play.

Scouting

n the early stages of the game, all scouting comes from Overlord vision, so be sure that you send your initial 2 Overlords towards your opponent?s natural expansion. You can use your Overlord to compare his Hatchery?s HP to yours, to determine what kind of opener he used. If his hatchery is stronger than yours, he has gone hatchery first. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is the same HP as yours, he has VERY LIKELY done the same build as you. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is weaker to yours, he has gone for a gas and pool before hatchery in some order, meaning his speed is quicker than yours. Banelings before speed in this scenario is often advised, and likely make the Baneling nest in the main to not lose your Baneling tech to mass Zerglings with speed. An alternative is to not use your Gas, and get extra Queens and 2-3 Spine Crawlers. The main theme here is to not get Speed first, as his WILL be quicker. You need to find an edge that isn?t using Zergling Speed.
When playing versus any very early aggression (<10 pool), use your Drones to defend until you have your own Zerglings, a Queen, and potentially a Spine Crawler. Consider canceling the Hatchery for more minerals. Also use your initial overlord to scout when your opponent is taking their natural Hatchery. Feel free to apply some light pressure with your first Zerglings against a Hatch first build, but do not let it mess up your macro.
Make sure you have 2 to 4 Zerglings out on the map at all times. Send your initial 2 Zerglings to your opponent?s base to spot what they have at the front, and if possible get into the main with 1 Ling to see whether your hatching Drones or Zerglings from their eggs. Use the scouting intel that these pokes give you to determine whether you should get Banelings and extra Zerglings to defend yourself or pressure your opponent, or whether you should continue droning.
If your scout Zerglings see Drones hatching, and no wall at the front, you can choose to make Drones OR Zerglings to pressure. If you scout Zerglings, and no wall at the front, you should make the same amount of Zerglings. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings escape, send them back in to scout in 20~ seconds. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings die, remake the scout. Consider another 2 Zerglings for just-in-case Banelings. If you scout a wall, the Zerg is likely playing passive and you are likely safe.
As soon as you are sure you are safe, transition into your choice of tech.

Transitions

However, because you have not yet committed upgrades to either Ranged or Melee, you can choose between transitioning into Roach Hydra or Ling Ultra.
If you do choose to go for Roaches, immediately research Roach Speed and take your third, while droning as heavily as you can without endangering yourself. You can transition to a similar midgame to that of Vortix?s 3 Base Speed Roach, albeit without the fast upgrades.
It is not recommended you go for a Mutalisk transition.

Tips

Aim to focus down Queens with transfuse energy first, and use Roaches to tank any Baneling hits. Emphasize surrounds with your Speedlings and tank Banelings with your Roaches.

Pros and Cons

This build excels and punishing either greedier Roach players, and players rushing for Mutalisks. If it fails, you are behind as with any timing attack. You do not have any tech, you have no upgrades, and you will almost certainly be behind in drones. Additionally, because you are opening gasless, your defense is likely to be much more difficult. You will have no Banelings or Zergling speed, so your defense will revolve entirely around Spine Crawlers, Queens, and building placement.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Queen,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Drone,RoachWarren,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Extractor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,SpawnCreepTumor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,SpawnCreepTumor,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,SpawnCreepTumor', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:35:26 PM;

This build opens with 2 Barracks to produce a lot of Reapers very quickly.  It is a great way to get complete map control with 4 Reapers, apply heavy pressure to an expanding opponent, and transition into standard Bio play.  This 2rax Reaper build also can instantly win against some Gas First or CC First builds.

Scouting

This build is a reasonably safe build against most things Terran can open with as long as you are smart with your initial four Reapers. Thus, SCV scouting early on is not required or even suggested. Use your Reapers to take map control and pick off Marines/scout the front. However, there may come a time when your opponent has a Bunker up and you can no longer poke the front. Then, while prioritizing keeping your Reapers alive over all else, jump into his base and pick off SCVs/continue to scout.

If you scout your opponent opening Banshee, then cease Reaper productioninstead, favor making Marines and getting an earlier Engineering Bay. If you scout a Widow Mine Drop, then be wary of your opponents Medivac, and hole up in your main base until you have enough units to stabilize. If you scout a Marine/Tank/Banshee all-in, then keep your 2nd Command Center in your main base and play defensive. If you scout a 1rax FE, then scout for the Bio or Mech follow-up, and apply pressure whenever possible.

Note: If you scout your opponent going Mech, then add a 2nd Tech lab instead of Reactor on your initial Barracks and build some marauders too.  You can still follow the same basic build order, but you will have a little less gas than normal, so you might need to get early gas geysers than what is written up above.

Transitions

This build commits too much into Infantry upgrades for you to transition into Mech. However, it transitions quite smoothly into Marine/Tank or pure Bio (vs Mech).

For a Marine/Tank transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory for Siege Tank production, take your third base, start your 4th-6th gas geysers, and start another Engineering Bay+Armory for more upgrades. With your midgame push, confirm what unit composition your opponent is going, and play aggressively/passively accordingly.

For a pure Bio transition (if your opponent is playing Mech), start another Engineering Bay and Armory to continue your upgrades as you take your 3rd Command Center and keep your opponent pinned back. Threaten boosted Medivac drops whenever possible, but do not over commit your army if your opponent has an adequate defense.

Pros and Cons

This build is a safe build that also opens aggressively. With this build, you can pick off Marines and SCV, while simultaneously getting a full scout of your opponents base and stressing their multitasking. This build also has a heavy Marine follow up, and can deal with Banshees or 1/1/1 all-ins rather well due to the Reactor/Tech lab first. This transitions into normal Bio play but gives you the advantage due to early harass and map control.

However, this build performs poorly against early Hellion openings. If you scout Reactored Hellions, cease Reaper production instantly and transition into faster Marine/Marauder production. Also, if your opponent holds the Reapers cost-effectively with a 1rax FE or CC First (either due to you mis-microing, or them having a solid defense), then you will be behind going into the midgame economically.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,Barracks,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Reaper,SCV,SCV,Reaper,Reaper,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Barracks,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,CallMule,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,Marine,CombatShield,SCV,Marine,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Refinery,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,Factory,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,EngineeringBay,StimPack,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SCV,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,CallMule,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marine,CallMule,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,LiftFactoryFromReactor,TechLabOnFactory,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:35:27 PM;

This mass Reaper build order gets 2 Reactored Barracks cranking out 4 Reapers at a time in order to overwhelm your opponent with purely mass Reaper.

Scouting

There is minimal SCV scouting with this build because you will open the same regardless of what your opponent is making. The majority of your scouting comes from your constant Reaper attacks.

Against anything but Banshees, constantly produce Reapers to overwhelm your opponent. Against Banshees, be sure to cancel your Reaper production and start producing 4 Marines at a time. If you have done significant economic damage, then getting an Engineering Bay for a Missile Turret is not a bad idea either.

Transitions

This build actually transitions pretty well into a decent midgame for being an all-in. However, you can only transition into Bio after opening with this build because it is hard to utilize your quick Reactors and two Barracks early on if you are trying to transition into Mech. When you feel like you cannot do any more damage with your Reapers, be sure to stop Reaper production and begin your Bio upgrades.

For a standard Bio follow-up, get your natural expansion, start Marine production, and get a 3rd Barracks with a Tech lab. This way you can start Stimpack, an Engineering Bay, Factory, and 3rd Refinery all at the same time just like as if you had opened with a normal 1rax FE into Medivacs.

For a fast upgrade transition, start your natural expansion, Marine production from the 2 Barracks, 2 Engineering Bays, and then +1/+1. As soon as you can, get one more Barracks with a Tech lab so that you can start researching Stimpack. Then, you can take your third Refinery and get a Factory to go into Reactored Medivacs and +2/+2.

For a follow-up timing attack, start your natural expansion, Marine production, and a Factory instantly.  Get a Tech lab on the Factory and start Siege Tank production in order to hit a very fast Marine/Tank push with your second Siege Tank. Behind this contain/attack, you can get your 3rd base, 3rd and 4th Refineries, double Engineering Bays, and 2 or 3 more Barracks (get Stimpack and Combat Shields).

Execution

As soon as your first Reapers pop, start being aggressive. Your number one goal is to deny your opponents Factory for as long as possible (Hellions or Widow Mines can be difficult to maneuver around), but in order to do this, you have to be in your opponents face with your Reapers as soon as they are built. Also, with your constant harass, be sure to dwindle your opponents Marine count without committing too hard and losing any Reapers.

Your Reaper count increases very quickly, and when you get around 6 to 8 Reapers, you can truly overwhelm most units your opponent can have.  Thus, focus on killing his army with your initial Reapersyou will be able to kill his SCVs once his army is dead.

In general, if your opponent sees what you are doing, you are in trouble.  Thus, it is suggested that at least one of your Barracks is build outside your base (even just at your natural will sometimes work fine). However, you can proxy both Barracks outside your main to make this build a little more all-in too. This also works for some mind games because if your opponent scouts you with a Refinery but no Barracks in your main, he will most likely try to defend proxy Marauders (a defense that is awful on most maps against mass Reaper).

Pros and Cons

This build is very aggressive and can catch many opponents off-guard.  With a hilarious amount of Reapers, you are usually able to overwhelm their army within the first 8 minutes. However, even if the all-in does fail, it can still transition into a 11-12 minute Bio+Stimpack/Medivac timing.

However, if you do not do much damage, you will be quite behind your opponent in tech (and possibly income). Also, this build can be easily scouted if an SCV sees both Reactors building before a single unit, so at least one of the Barracks must be proxied outside of your main.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Refinery,OrbitalCommand,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,DoubleReapers,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleReapers,SCV,DoubleReapers,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleReapers,DoubleReapers,CallMule,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:35:27 PM;

The cool thing is that you don't even need to pressure with the units. You can, but really all you need to do is show that you have some sentries and zealots coming their way, send a hallucinationto scout and then stay at a watch tower and fake them into over reacting while you take a 3rd and tech to this wonderful thing called the Dark Shrine.

Now these aren't meant to be the fastest DTs in the world by any means, but they hit at such an awkward time that the zerg really shouldn't be expecting (especially after seeing a 3gate sentry pressure opening). So they have a chance to do quite a good deal of damage. Also, if they commit to a counter attack with the early units you forced out of them the DTs will do much more damage and you will also have your robo pumping out immortals at home to defend any roach follow ups that could happen.

After your cheeky DTs do their job you can saturate your 3rd and go up to +2/blink/immortal for a strong 3 base timing a few minutes after the DTs hit that can outright end the game if they aren't prepared or took too much damage from the DTs.

The high sentry count early on also makes it so you can throw out non stop hallucinations to really see what the zerg is up to an what tech they're choosing. If you see swarm hosts you of course need to throw down a robo bay and 2nd robo instead of doing the immortal +2 follow up otherwise you own't be ale to bust them. Mutas can also be dealt with via base trade quite well (so long as you identify it quickly enough and can hit while they're in production and you leave some cannons at your 3rd).

If they go for a high hydra count and it doesn't seem like your +2 blink immortal follow up can kill them then you can go into some form of splash damage while taking a 4th and just harassing them a bit to keep him away from your 4th and buy time for said splash damage.

This classic 7 Roach Rush all-in is a great build for newer players to learn one base macro with. It hits a very quick timing that can crush through inexperienced or unsuspecting opponents.

Scouting

This build can be performed against any opener Terran has. The only scouting you need to do is send your initial 2 Overlords to your opponent?s base in order to spot both where your opponent is spawned and whether or not they have a Bunker or Marauders that you will have to break down or fight.

Transitions

This 7 Roach Rush build is a strong 1 base attack that opens with a lot of units and few Drones, so your follow-up will be very slow. That being said, you should start to float some minerals as you are reaching your opponent?s base, so start a natural Hatchery, build a lot more Drones, and get Metabolic Boost as soon as possible. Going for a Lair and getting a Banelings Nest in order to start a Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk composition is a strong way to deal with Terran in the midgame.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong 1 base attack that can crush your opponent early before they have their midgame even established. However, this build can be held off if your opponent scouts it and prepares with a repaired Bunker or Marauders if they have opened with a 1 base play of their own.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '8-8-8 Proxy Reaper', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This all-in gets the fastest possible Reaper with which to do damage against your opponent. It then follows up with another Barracks so that you can make enough Reapers to overwhelm your opponent and outright win the game before it has even begun.

Scouting

You will be doing this build no matter what, so there is no SCV scouting.  The rest of your scouting will come from your Reapers seeing what your opponent has. However, an interesting SCV timing to note: you will reach a very nice proxy location with your SCV on most 2 person maps if you send it out exactly as you get 50 minerals for the first time at 8 supply.

Transitions

There is no defined transition from this build; it is basically all-in after all.  However, if your opponent goes for very quick roaches then you might want to add-on Tech labs and get Marauders. Besides that, you should have enough Reapers to evenly trade with anything your opponent can make, as long as you can stutter step appropriately.

Tips

- Do NOT lose any of your first 3 Reapers. They are the most important part of this build  applying the early pressure, forcing Drones to be pulled, and most importantly stopping Queens/Roaches from being made. If you lose them, you will most likely lose the game.
- Do not stop for Hatcheries or buildings of any kind. Go straight for the Drones and force some to be pulled off the worker line. If your opponent has their full economy up they will simply outproduce you.
- The only micro you have to do is stutter step against Zerglings/Drones, and pull back the weakest Reaper against Queens.
- 4 Reapers will kill a Queen without you losing a single one of them as long as you pull the targeted Reaper back in time.
- In order to hit the exact build order supplies above, you will have to cut some SCVs for several seconds.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '3gate Proxy Oracle All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This micro-intensive build rushes for a proxy Stargate, and then pumps out Oracles to do damage to your opponent?s mineral line while simultaneously crushing through your opponent?s front with a strong Gateway+Mothership Core army.

Attack your opponent?s main mineral line with 1st Oracle as soon as it finishes (@6:15ish), and push at front with Zealot/Stalker/Mothership Core.

Scouting

This build is an all-in that makes a lot of units, so is safe in general vs an aggressive opponent ? the only scouting you need to do is spot where your opponent has spawned and whether or not they have taken gas. If you are performing this build vs a gasless Terran, you can be much more aggressive with your initial 3 units and oracle. Versus a gassing Terran, you must be wary of Widow Mines, so be sure not to clump up your units when pushing up ramps or going into your opponent?s mineral line with your Oracles.

Transitions

This build is an all-in, so note that there is no clear transition out of it.  Continue making oracles (up to 3 or 4) and warping in Stalkers so that you can break the front. Note that if your opponent does eventually hold and you end up losing your entire army, then you are most likely behind both economically and in tech. Only expand and continue producing Probes once/if you break the front and you are just making sure that you have enough economy to follow up with a win.

Pros and Cons

This build hits very early with a proxied Oracle, taking advantage of the weakness of early game Marines without upgrades. This build is so strong because it gives you enough units to pressure both your opponent?s front and their mineral line simultaneously. It also then gives you the infrastructure needed to warp-in enough Gateway units to eventually bust down your opponent?s front.

However, this build is a very micro intensive build ? you must be target firing with your Oracle in the main, while not losing any of the units in the front, usually for at least 3 minutes. It is also weak vs Widow Mines if you have poor control. Lastly, note that this build is in fact an all-in, so doing some damage but losing your entire army does put you behind by quite a bit.

Tips

- Chronoboost your initial Stalker so that you deny scouting from your opponent as soon as possible.
- Do not get your initial Probe trapped in your opponent?s base or killed, for that will force you to send another Probe to build the proxy Pylon and lose more mining time.
- You have to target fire individual SCVs for the Pulsar Beam to be most effective.
- One Oracle can take down 4 Marines if it has enough energy for Pulsar Beam the entire time.
- You can use the Oracle?s Envision spell for mobile detection in case your opponent has opened Widow Mine or Banshee.
- Be wary of Widow Mines both in the front or in the main mineral line and stay alert of the 40 second cooldown they have between shots.
- Don?t forget to use the Mothership Core?s Time Warp ability to help vs SCVs/marines in the attack at the front.
- Once/if you break the front, be sure to build an expansion and resume Probe production just in case your opponent does eventually hold.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,GoOutProbe,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Probe,Zealot,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Chronoboost,Pylon,Stargate,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Oracle,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Oracle,Chronoboost,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Oracle,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:35:28 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '15 gas FE into Mine Drop to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reactored Rax FE gives you enough Marines to stay safe against early Protoss pressure, while still getting a fast expansion. Then it transitions into a fast Marine/Widow Mine drop to hit your opponent with some pressure of your own. Interestingly, this build can also transition into standard Bio play or macro Mech play.

Scouting

This build is largely safe against any early pressure that Protoss can apply because it gives you a Reactored Barracks to pump out Marines two at a time. Also, if you are feeling unsafe, you have the minerals after your reactor finishes to place down a Bunker at your natural. Also, if your opponent is doing a 1 base all-in, then instead of being aggressive with your Marines/Widow Mines, you can keep them in your main and defend your Bunker/main. By simply constantly producing Widow Mines, Marines, and Medivacs to keep replenishing your defenses, you can remain safe against most all-ins. However seeing the all-ins coming is crucial. Scouting your opponents natural expansion timing with an SCV is huge (if your opponent does not have an expansion started by around 5:30, expect an all-in). Besides seeing an all-in coming, the rest of your midgame scouting will come from seeing how your opponent defends the Widow Mine drop.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because it gets a good economy, but also enough Marines to defend early game Protoss pokes. Then, the Marine/Widow Mine drop gives you complete map control AND keeps your opponent in the dark as to what followup you are doing (Mech/Bio/3CC). Not to mention that if your opponent is not careful, this build can get Widow Mines in your opponents mineral lines and land some huge hits on Probes, essentially winning the game instantly.

However, this build is more vulnerable to later all-ins such as Void ray or Blink+Mothership core all-ins than more standard bio play (because you will not have stim yet), so be sure to position your Widow Mines defensively and add on more bunkers against a Protoss that you have scouted isnt expanding. Also, with poor Medivac control, you can very easily lose your Medivac and all the Widow Mines if you are not careful. Lastly, this build is not quite as economical as a 1rax FE build, but it still gets a pretty reasonably fast expand, so its not too far behind a 1rax FE build in terms of economy at all.

Tips

- Early game Stalker/Mothership Core pressure may be hard to deal with, but position your Marines effectively and hold on until you get out a Widow Mine in order to defend your base.
- Once you have pinned your opponent on an aggressive build (for instance, by scouting a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), do NOT move out; instead, posture your Widow Mines and Marines in an appropriately defensive position.
- Oracles flat out destroy marines, so if you are fighting an opponent going for Stargate, position your Widow Mines by the mineral line and even consider getting out one turret per base.
- When committing to an attack, boost in and drop one Widow Mine at your opponents main-to-natural ramp in order to trap his army on one half of his base. Once you have his ramp locked down, you will have several seconds of complete control of the half of his base where his army is not located. Use these seconds to kill workers and/or position a mine in a crucial location.
- Above all else, the strength of this build is non-stop harass/pressure.

This fast expansion build created by Innovation uses Hellions to stay safe against Reapers, Banshees, and Hellbatsall while taking map control.

Scouting

Scouting with this build until you get your first Hellions out is not necessary.  However if you want to SCV scout, checking your opponents gas timing clues you in on what they could possibly be doing.

If your SCV sees that your opponent has mined more gas than you have, the most likely are opening with Reapers. However, even if you do not get into your opponents base, you can still tell a Reaper is coming by leaving your scout next to your opponents Barracks to spot whether it dies to a Marine or a Reaper. Your first 2 Marines positioned in your main at a Reaper jump-up spot, followed up by the Reactor for extra Marine production should crush any aggressive Reaper play if you react with and position your initial Marines well. With the Reactored Hellion follow-up you can seize map control and spot if there are any other pushes coming.

When your second Orbital Command finishes and you are still worried about a 1 base play, consider scanning your opponents main base.  Against 1 base play, be sure to have good vision around your base to prevent elevators and to defend your front with a Bunker. Also, a Missile Turret per mineral line with one Viking will shut down any Widow Mine Drops into Cloak Banshee openers. Lastly, if your opponent is going for Hellbat drops, then producing more than 6 Hellions and starting a Viking can be really helpful for your defensenormal Hellions do quite well against Hellbats, and Vikings do quite well at deterring Medivacs.

Execution

If your opponent invested more than 2 Reapers before expanding into bio play, then this is your cue to do heavy damage. If he played greedy and didnt build a bunker at his natural, you can go in with your 4 Hellions, 6 Marines and your first Medivac and kill his un-upgraded Marines. If there is a Bunker at the natural, then simply elevator your Marines and then Hellions into your opponents main and kill as many units as you can.

Against Mech play you might have to play a bit more conservative with your aggression because in Hellion vs Hellion fights, the player who was positioned correctly before the fight usually has the advantage. Instead of committing to an attack or elevator, pulling your army back and placing down a quick 3rd Command Center is a safer way to play.

Against standard Bio play, you can attempt to hit a Marine/Hellion timing at his front with your first 4 Hellions, 6 Marines, and a Medivac. Or, if your opponent is too well defended at the front, perform a 4 Hellion drop and harass his SCVs instead. Getting your 2nd Barracks and starting Stimpack before taking your 3rd Command Center is crucial to staying safe against 10 minute Bio timings and drop play. Alternatively, going Mech and producing Widow Mines/Siege Tanks as you take your third base is a strong way to stay safe as well.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into anything: Marine/Tank or Mech play. Note that as stated in the Execution section above, the follow-up you can do after you get your initial Marine/Hellion/Medivac army is completely dependent on your own preference and the play style of your opponent.

When transitioning into Bio play, against Mech and 3CC builds you can get away with starting your 3rd CC right away and following-up with 2 Barracks with Tech labs (to start Stimpack/Combat Shields), 3 Refineries, and 2 Engineering bays. Against more traditional Bio play it is necessary to start a Tech lab on your initial Barracks for a quicker Stimpack. Then, after taking a 2nd Refinery, you can build a 2nd Barracks onto the naked Reactor and start Siege Tank production to take yourself into the midgame. This is followed up by a 3rd Command Center (between 8:00-8:30), 1 more Barracks, both Refineries at your natural expansion, and 2 Engineering bays. Not having Stimpack completed in time for the inevitable 10ish minute drop play can be a game changer because with the new Medivacs boosting around your main and natural, it is very easy to get caught out of position and take a lot of damage for free.

ForGG does an interesting follow-up where he simply constantly produces Hellions  sometimes going up to 20+ Hellions  and overwhelms his opponents before they have Stimpack or enough Siege Tanks to deal with this attack. Mass Hellions are surprisingly good against opponents who make Hellbats or try drop play without a perfect follow-up.

Another possible follow-up is going for Mech play. This is easily achieved by keeping the Factory onto the Reactor for more Hellions, getting all 4 Refineries while starting more Factories, and starting your 3rd Command Center very quickly. Building some Vikings for drop defense will definitely come in handy as well.

Pros and Cons

This build defends early pressure quite easily, while getting a quick expansion and going into the midgame. Also, once your first Medivac is out, you hit your opponent with lots of pressure early on to kick start an aggressive game. Finally, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for opening with a 1/1/1 grants you the freedom to go into nearly anything.

However, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades. Also, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Factory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,Starport,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SCV,OrbitalCommand,SCV,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,Medivac', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:35:28 PM;

This fast expansion build created by Maru uses a lot of scouting in order to stay safe against Reapers and Banshees, getting out enough Marines and the infrastructure needed to defend all sorts of aggression that early-game TvT can have.

Scouting

Figuring out your opponents opening so that you can react appropriately when you are performing this build is crucial. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that you SCV scout around 12 or 13 supply in order to see whether your opponent has opened gas first or not.

If your SCV gets into your opponents base and sees that your opponents Barracks is delayed compared to yours, you know that they are opening gas first  the most likely scenario being Polts Gas First Banshee Build.  However, there are some Gas First Hellion openers, so stick around until the first Marine pops so that you can see what add-ons your opponent is making. A fast Tech lab usually will be swapped off onto the Starport for a fast Banshee. A fast Reactor can be used to swap off and go for Hellions.  Against Hellion play, build your Command Center and keep your Marines on the high ground.

If you get into your opponents base and see that your opponent has mined more gas than you have, the most likely scenario is that they are opening with Reapers. Note that even if you do not get into your opponents base, you can still tell a Reaper is coming by leaving your scouting SCV next to your opponents Barracks to spot whether the first unit to pop out is a Marine or a Reaper. Against Reaper play, build your Command Center and position your Marines on the high ground. If your opponent commits to 2rax Reaper or Mass Reaper play, transitioning into Innovations Marine/Hellion Expand to stay safe (instead of taking a 2nd gas and instantly opening with a Starport) is a common reaction. With the Reactored Hellion follow-up you can seize map control and deal with Reapers quite easily.

If your opponent is opening with an expansion of their own or has mined the same amount of gas as you have, then consider cutting the Raven and going into delayed Cloaked Banshee OR Siege Tank production of your own. Whichever you choose is personal preference.

When your second Orbital Command finishes and you are still worried about a 1 base play, consider scanning your opponents main base.  Against 1 base non-Banshee play, starting Siege Tanks and using your Raven for Seeker Missile is an easy way to stay safe. Against 1 base Banshee play, position your Marines and Raven near your production or mineral line as you start a Viking or two for extra defense.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either Marine/Tank/Medivac or Mech play.

When transitioning into Marine/Tank play, against Mech and 3CC builds you can get away with starting your 3rd Command Center right away and following-up with 2 Barracks with Tech labs (to start Stimpack/Combat Shields), 3 Refineries, and 2 Engineering bays.

Against a player opening straight into Bio play, however, it is necessary to start a Tech lab on your initial Barracks as soon as possible for a quicker Stimpack. Then, after taking a 2nd Refinery, you can build a 2nd Barracks onto the naked Reactor and start Siege Tank production to take yourself into the midgame. This is followed up by a 3rd Command Center (between 8:00-8:30), 1 more Barracks, both Refineries at your natural expansion, and 2 Engineering Bays. Not having Stimpack completed in time for the inevitable 10ish minute drop play can be a game changer because with the new Medivacs boosting around your main and natural, it is very easy to get caught out of position and take a lot of damage for free.

Another possible follow-up is going for Mech play. By starting a 3rd Command Center instantly, getting all 4 Refineries, and making 2 more Factories and an Armory, youll instantly be at the midgame infrastructure you need. Be sure to make Vikings for drop defense and start your Siege Tank production instantly so that you have a healthy Siege Tank count to defend any early drops/pressure.

Tips

- Fully read the Scouting section of this build before performing it in a game.  The reactions to scouting information as presented in the Scouting section must be learned before this build is even worth performing in a real game.
- SCV scout with this build at 12 or 13 supply.
- If you are absolutely sure your opponent is not opening with Banshee play, then starting delayed Banshee production of your own instead of the Raven is a great way to get midgame map control and a lot more scouting information.
- Against the first Banshee, you might need to pull all of your Marines to your production or mineral line while you wait for the Raven to pop.  This is completely fine  try to minimize damage by pulling all of your SCVs to one location so that your Raven provides detection over all of your vulnerable spots once it is out.
- Anticipate how many Banshees your opponent is making and either continue to produce Vikings or stop after 1 or 2 for safety.
- Be sure to transition into your midgame infrastructure as soon as you have successfully defended the Banshees.

Pros and Cons

This build defends early pressure quite easily, while getting a quick expansion and going into the midgame. Also, this build is incredibly versatile when it comes to transitions, for opening with a 1/1/1 grants you the freedom to transition into nearly anything.

However, this build requires a lot of scouting in order to be performed effectively. The reactions and transitions you must perform depend entirely on your scouting information and interpretation of your opponents build order.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Factory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,Refinery,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Starport,DoubleMarines,SCV,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,LandStarportOnTechLab,Raven,WidowMine,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,ScannerSweep,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,LiftStarportFromTechLab,LandFactoryOnTechLab,SiegeTank,SupplyDepot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:35:28 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Alicia 12-12 Colossus All-In', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build utilizes an unconventional Gateway and gas timing to produce a fast Mothership Core for scouting before smoothly transitioning into a 2 Colossus All-in.

Attack your opponent when your 2nd Colossus finishes (@9:30ish) with 2 Colossi, 3 Stalkers, 3 Sentries, and a Mothership Core with about 45 Probes at home.

Scouting

Do not Probe scout with this build. Because you are using a 12/12 opening, you will have an extremely early Mothership Core for immediate scouting. Your Mothership Core should be directly rallied to the enemy base upon completion.

The early Mothership Core allows you to see exactly what a Terran is aiming for. If they are aiming for Factory aggression with a Starport simply chronoboost out 2 Observers, placing one in each base. Position your 3 Stalkers in the main to catch a drop. Bring your Mothership Core home and use it to defend the natural with Photon Overcharge. This defensive setup should allow you to defend any multi-pronged aggression from the Terran.

If it is merely a 2 base, 3 Barracks opener, then proceed as normal.

Transitions

As this is an all-in, the transitions for this build are heavily dependent on the damage you deal. If you kill a significant amount of workers but find yourself unable to finish your opponent off, transition into normal Blink/Colossus play. If you do not kill many workers and lose your army, then you most likely will lose to a follow-up counterattack. If you trade armies but do eventually lose your own, you are free to instantly transition into anything you want?Blink/Colossus, Chargelot/Archon, or Storm play are all equally viable. Remember to start 2 Forges and chronoboost your upgrades to catch up in the upgrade war.

Tips

Produce a third Colossus and leave it at home along with your Mothership Core. This allows you to effectively defend counter aggression with 2 Photon Overcharges. You have enough punch in your frontal push with Forcefield and Guardian Shield not to require Time Warp.

Only chronoboost your 10th and 13th Probe before the completion of your Cybernetics Core. You need to bank energy to allow you to simultaneously chronoboost your Mothership Core and first Stalker. Otherwise your scouting information is delayed and a Reaper can play havoc with your main.

Once you have completed your Mothership Core and initial Stalker, return to chronoboosting Probes until the completion of your Robotics Bay. At this point exclusively chronoboost Colossi. If you find you have spare Nexus energy chronoboost Thermal Lance but prioritize accelerating your Colossus count ? your push begins once both Colossi have been completed.

Pros and Cons

This all-in is one of the most difficult to scout builds currently available to Protoss. To most Terran players it will look like standard macro play and may even prompt incorrect reactions such as earlier Medivac aggression or a fast 3rd Command Center. Also, because of the fast Mothership Core scout, you will almost always be able to identify Terran?s early game build structure (3rax, 1/1/1, etc).

However, because your Mothership Core stays at home for defense and you have no upgrades to fall back on, your attack is fully all-in?there is no way to retreat your Colossus safely if your attack fails and you are certain to fall behind in upgrades as the game stretches on.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Stalker,Chronoboost,WarpgateUpgrade,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Assimilator,Stalker,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,Nexus,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Chronoboost,Stalker,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Observer,RoboticsBay,Assimilator,Assimilator,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,WarpInSentry,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Pylon,Probe,Probe,ExtendedThermalLance,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:35:28 PM;

This variant on the standard 1rax FE build gets the midgame infrastructure up much earlier for a lot of midgame aggression, while sacrificing early safety against one and early two base Protoss attacks.

Scouting

When you send your scouting SCV, look for the number of gasses your opponent has, their Nexus energy, and also the units they are producing out of the Gateway. If he only has 1 gas before his stalker pops, check to see whether your opponent gets his natural at around 5:15 (You can hide your SCV nearby and then run it in around 5:30 to check for an expansion later if need be). If he has 2 gas or is not spending his chronoboost, then be wary of any sort of early attack.

Tips

- To confirm that your opponent is not all-inning you, have an SCV (or scan) go to his natural just before the 6 minute mark.  A 4gate will hit before this timing, but 2 bunkers and repair should be able to hold a 4gate easily enough; all other all-ins hit much later and this scout will give you enough time to mount an appropriate defense.
- You cannot afford Marauders with this build until you start the Starport. The 100 extra minerals and 50 gas from making 2 Marauders at a time will slow down the push by over a minute.
- Take map control when you initially poke out with your first two Medivacs. Do NOT engage Protoss yet though. This build sets up your infrastructure for a lot of reinforcements, but does not increase your army size until those reinforcements have actually arrived.
- Once the first or second wave of units from all 5 Barracks have popped (you should be making 3 Marauders and 4 marines at a time), straight up fight Protoss? army. Spread your army, kite Zealots, pick up units trapped between forcefields and zealots with Medivacs, and dodge storms as best you can. However, do not forget to build reinforcing units, and do not stop the aggression unless you are forced to. During this aggression, you also get to see what army composition your opponent has.  Get a 4th Refinery.  Then react appropriately to Colossus by making Vikings (and possibly a 2nd Starport) and to High Templar by making Ghosts.

Transitions

During the fighting, place down your 3rd CC, 2nd Engineering Bay and Armory, and Ghost academy or 2nd Starport to counter your opponent?s HTs or Colossi. Fighting your opponent across the map forces them to reveal which tech path they?ve gone down and safely give you the time you need to counter it before it comes to your base.

Pros and Cons

This 1rax FE variant cuts many early-game corners compared to other 1rax FEs.  Delaying the 2nd Refinery means that you cannot afford any Marauders at all until after your Starport has been started. Thus, in case your opponent does an early-game attack, you have to rely on Bunkers and SCVs to repair and tank damage much more than you would in other builds. However, what this build lacks in the early game it more than makes up for in the mid game. Getting five Barracks up that fast means that you can apply a lot of midgame aggression against your opponent.  With proper micro, it?s entirely possible to overrun the front with pure Marine/Marauder/Medivac even against Colossi or HTs, simply because of how many units you are reinforcing with.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,CommandCenter,SupplyDepot,SCV,Marine,CallMule,SCV,Bunker,Marine,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,Marine,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,CallMule,Marine,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,Bunker,Marine,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,SCV,StimPack,Refinery,SupplyDepot,Marine,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,CallMule,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,Factory,EngineeringBay,Refinery,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,CallMule,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,TechLabOnBarracks,ReactorOnBarracks,Marauder,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,CombatShield,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMedivacs,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnBarracks,ReactorOnBarracks', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:35:28 PM;

Simple, economical, and deceptively dangerous, Bomber takes us back to 2012 with an incredibly early 16 Marine Combat Shield Push that simultaneously takes a 6:00 3rd. An excellent low APM alternative for players who dislike Reapers and Hellions.

Scouting

Because you are not opening Reapers, you are in danger of unexpected Roach or Speedling attacks. And because you are not making Hellions, you will have difficulty confirming the existence of a Zerg third base if Speedlings are on the map, as well as being vulnerable to unscouted Baneling Busts. As such, your only SCV scout is crucial in determining if your Zerg opponent has opened with gas or not.

If your opponent has opened gasless, keep your scouting SCV alive and hidden as long as possible to confirm the existence of a third base by 6:30. If no third is taken by 6:30, it is worth scanning, as many dangerous builds, such as Soulkeys 1-1 Roach Timing, start gasless off of two bases.

If your opponent has opened gas but stopped mining at 100 gas, assume that Speedlings are on the way. As such, depending on how quickly your opponent chose to take his gas, a wall off is necessary before six minutes. It is fine to use your 3rd CC as part of your natural wall off on certain maps, such as Frost, Yeonsu, and Polar Night. However, if your opponent went for much faster Speedlings (Gas -> Pool -> Hatch), then it is advisable to wall off ASAP using Depots and bunkers, and delaying your 3rd CC. Additionally, consider not performing your Marine timing if the speedling count is abnormally high (30 or above).

If your opponent has opened gas but has continued mining past 100, it is necessary to check whether or not Metabolic Boost is researching with your scouting SCV. Beyond that, scan to see what is coming your way and build extra bunkers if necessary. You are specifically looking for a combination of the following: obvious tech cues (baneling nest, roach warren, fast lair), lack of Queens/Creep Spread (if there are only two injecting, then something is wrong), lack of Evolution Chambers, lack of a timely third base, and a flood of overlords.

It is highly reommended you do not perform your timing unless it is obvious your opponent is opening nonthreatening gas tech, such as Overlord Speed or very fast upgrades. And finally, depending on what you scout, if it becomes very obvious that no timing will occur, consider getting Stimpack instead of Combat Shields, as well as producing Marauders from your tech labbed Barracks.

Transitions

Because you have already invested so much infrastructure into Barracks and infantry upgrades, your only transition from this build is a bio based composition. However, because you have invested no money whatsoever into Factory tech, you can transition smoothly into Biomine, Biobat, Biobat with Thors, Marine Tank, or even Pure Bio.

Additionally, the Factory and Engineering Bay ordering is entirely up to the users discretion. If you feel you are in danger of a counter all in, or want faster Medivacs for aggression, then start the Factory first. If you feel that you do not want to fall behind in upgrades, start two Engineering bays first.

Tips

Your first priority with this build is accurately assessing whether or not you can do damage with a timing push.

If you feel you can do damage with the timing, do your best to ensure your opponent has as little idea of it as possible. Have lone marines ready at your base to deny Overlord scouting, and hide the bulk of your marines on the main ramp connecting to the natural base. Keep your Barracks away from the edges of your base; especially the one with a researching Tech Lab. If there is a way to construct a third base that an Overlord can obviously see it (such as by the natural choke at Polar Night, where there is almost always an overlord), then that would be best. Most Zergs upon seeing such an early third will let their guard down and drone heavily.

As youre moving out with the Marine squad at 7:00, have at least two scans saved and do your best to avoid obvious overlord positions, and either clear the towers beforehand (impossible vs Speedlings) or avoid them altogether if possible. The best possible scenario is you catch your opponent completely off guard with no Larva banked in the middle of a huge cycle of drones, with 16 marines at his third base.

Use your banked scans as best you can to clear huge swatches of creep, with priority on active tumors. If you do kill the third, use your discretion to decide whether or not attacking further into the natural (emphasis now on the Evolution Chambers or Nat Hatch) or retreating with your marines is the better choice.

DO NOT REINFORCE THIS PUSH. It relies heavily on the element of surprise. Once Zerg reacts and begins to produce cycles of defending units, your reinforcements (3 marines every 25 seconds) will be easily overwhelmed without force multipliers such as Widow Mines, Medivacs, or Battlecruisers.

During the actual engagements, stutter stepping and positioning are critical. Wedging all your marines into the mineral line of his third and using his hatchery as a choke seems to be the optimal engagement zone. If slow banes are involved, split as best you can without stim or target fire them down.

On the other hand, if you feel you cannot do damage with your timing, theres no problem whatsoever. Stay behind your walloff, make bunkers if necessary, and wait for Factory Tech and Medivacs to perform a standard creep clearing push. You are already ahead with your 6:00 3rd and triple MULE income.

Pros and Cons

This build is one of the most economical builds available while still having a surprising amount of potential to outright win a game. It also deflects non baneling based aggression excellently, such as Roach Ling timings. Additionally, the build has a surprising amount of creep clearing potential, as few Zergs will stand toe to toe with 16 Combat Shield Marines this early in the game; most Zergs will surrender their creep without a fight.

The weaknesses of this build, however, are equally apparent.If scouted, the push has a high chance of outright failing. In addition, because your infrastructure is so limited during and following the attack (3 mostly naked Barracks), you are extremely susceptible to counter all ins and heavy Baneling based counter attacks, especially after you kill their third but lose all 16 marines in the process.

And finally, because you have not opened Reapers or hellions, your information is extremely limited, and confirming the existence of a third base can be very difficult if you lose your scouting SCV too early on.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,OrbitalCommand,Marine,CommandCenter,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,Marine,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,OrbitalCommand,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Marine,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,CombatShield,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,CommandCenter,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Marine,Refinery,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,Marine,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,CallMule,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,EngineeringBay,EngineeringBay,ReactorOnBarracks,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,StimPack,OrbitalCommand,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,InfantryArmorLevel1,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Factory,Refinery,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marauder,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SCV,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Marauder,Armory,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,CallMule,TechLabOnFactory,Factory,SCV,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DrillingClaws,Barracks,Barracks,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,ConcussiveShells,InfantryWeaponsLevel2,InfantryArmorLevel2,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,ReactorOnFactory,CommandCenter,Marauder,DoubleMedivacs', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:35:28 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Blink into Robo', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'So this build still goes into colossus however it opens with a more aggressive stance that puts you in more control during the early parts of the game. Going straight for colossus double forge is extremely passive and leaves no real room for you to do much until you get your 3rd base saturated. However opening blink allows you that small amount of map control/versatility that we loved oh so much a few patches ago that was unfortunately ripped from our repertoire.

The other cool thing about this build is that unless they open gas first, you can do this build basically any game. Even 1 rax reaper into factory gets shut down by this since the 2nd observer comes out in time to deal with any widow mine drops that will come from that build. You can even do some follow up blink pressure with a lot of added stalkers to punish them while they're building their infrastructure up and their unit count is low.

Even the 3 rax stim builds that I made a thread on earlier this week can be stopped with this build. I found out really that once you see that build coming into form, then it's all about not being greedy with your tech and trying to get a colossus out ASAP or something like that. You just need to make as many units as possible out of your gateways. It won't hold it as well as the purely defensive robo/3gate style however you definitely can still make the hold so long as you get your gates at the time in this write up and not later like in some variants.

This build puts us back in control again which is what we have wanted for so long after blink/HT openers have been pushed out of style. Of course the only down side to this build is that the upgrades are later, however you can easily compensate for that with double forge and mass amounts of chronoboost being used into it. Since the build is so solid you shouldn't be losing too many probes to early harassment (early blink helps with that so much) so the only thing that you'll need to use your chronoboost on is the upgrades.

Adding a warp prism or two while you're getting your 3rd set up also meshes with this build very well.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Bomber Reaper FE to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE, optimized by Startale Bomber, gets out exactly one Reaper for scouting as well and a ridiculously fast Command Center. Then it follows up with a Bio army with just as much strength as a gasless 1rax FE can provide.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they get an expansion (or note if they do not expand by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Also, if you do not know whether your opponent has a Stargate or not, it is a safe plan to build one Missile Turret per mineral line to defend any Oracle shenanigans.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and Medivacs. After this build, get a 3rd Command Center, 3 more Barracks (for a total of 8), and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to head into a strong, late game army.

Note: It is completely viable to replace the 4th and 5th Barracks in this build with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost, most Terrans (including Startale Bomber) have been getting lots of Barracks early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having those extra reinforcements.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important  be sure to mine exactly 100 Gas so that you have enough for the Reaper and Reactor and no more.  Getting your natural Command Center up before the 2nd Supply Depot is a strength of this build.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add a 2nd Bunker at the front, and consider getting a Missile Turret in each mineral line.
- Oracles, even with an expansion, massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you have to instantly get out one Missile Turret per mineral line.
- The gas timings of this build are somewhat more delayed than what you might be used to if you usually play with a gasless 1rax FE.  Therefore, be sure to cut all Marauder production until after your Starport has completed.
- When you move out with your Medivacs, be sure to boost in and out of where your opponent is expecting.  Forcing out the Mothership Cores energy can be the difference between an quick win and a potential loss.

Pros and Cons

This build is good because it gives you the economy and infrastructure on par with a Wings of Liberty style 1rax FE. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Getting such a fast Reactor gives you enough marines to defend early game Stalker + Mothership Core harass.  Finally, this build takes no detours and goes directly into Bio+Medivac play, so your Stim+Medivac aggression happens much sooner than if you go for an early Widow Mine Drop.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes, especially if you lose your Reaper.

If you want you can totally take a slightly later 3rd (~8-9 minutes) and just get 3 extra gates before the expand if you don't feel comfortable taking the fast 3rd. Just make sure you keep the robo timing the same.

This build really relies on you being able to scout with the oracle and reacting to what the zerg is doing. It's a very reactive and versatile opening which why I said it doesn't really die to anything as long as you execute it properly. Even if the stargate gets scouted/the oracle can't get too much done don't worry. You at least want to get scouting information with it as that is the most important. The drone or queen kills are only an added bonus if they aren't prepared.

If you see any sort of ling pressure to contest your 3rd then you should bring the oracle back to help defend. It's best to move the oracle down the common path of attack when it spawns to see if this kind of pressure is coming.

Any roach aggression can be stopped by earlier void ray production and even a few immortals before colossi if it's really early roach aggression.

Defending hydra/ling attacks is all about good sim city and forcefields and being sure your colossus doesn't get supply blocked or delayed at all. Your colossus being late is probably the worst thing you can do with this build as that's what really keeps you alive vs a lot of zerg pressure.

And of course if you see spire play then you have 3 stargates to make mass phoenix.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Creator Blink-obs expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'This build allows for a huge amount of versatility by being able to deal with pretty much any opener they can throw at you.

The idea is that you get a lot of units out of 1 gate while teching up to blink and robo so that way you can easily split your forces to deal with the variety of openings that can come at you. Once you determine your position in the game, you can easily expand and start teching up to immortal/archon.

So how exactly do you deal with the different openings?

Stargate:

This is a fairly simple one. Most of the time you won't be able to see that they're going stargate (unless it's a very quick directly after cyber build) in which case you will be playing defensively with your units anyway. Whether it's phoenix or oracle you will have 3 stalkers and a MSCore to deal with whatever comes at you with an additional 3 stalkers coming out of WG once that finishes, with blink soon following. This allows for a very easy stargate defense in which case you can then expand and put on light pressure with your blink/obs while defending at home with the MSCore.

If you want you can cancel the robo to go for a blink all in after seeing this, however some people (like Zest in the Shoutcraft tournament) will go for stargate and then DT to follow it up if they see you do blink/robo expecting you to cancel it. However this is usually because of pros at the highest level trying to get every ounce of their money for something beneficial, so it was mostly a smart gamble by Zest.

Blink:

With blink you're going to have to identify it a little early. If you see a large stalker opening then blink should be in the back of your mind. In this case you can easily get an immortal out with time bought by overcharge so you can have blink + immo to his pure blink. If he commits heavily then you can usually just counter push for the win, or you can simply expand and be ahead since you have the tech advantage.

DT:

This is quite simple as well. Robo finishes, you get an obs out, you kill DTs, you expand and continue as normal.

Robo expand:

In this situation your nexus will be slightly farther behind than his, however you will have the ability to poke and prod at him with blink so the slightly later nexus is not the biggest of deals. You will have added mobility and you will also know that they are being super passive so you can chrono probes nonstop to get back on the same economic footing. The best thing you can do with your stalkers is to pick off sentries that you see in the front. This denies him scouting (no hallucination) and requires him to waste gas he doesn't want to replenish them if he really wants to.

This build opens with a 3 Gateways and Blink, using a Hallucinated Phoenix to scout for potential Dark Shrine or Stargate shenanigans. It produces a healthy Stalker count to apply pressure to your opponent or safely secure your expansion against any all-in.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker(s) back to the protection of your Sentry quickly if you have to defend an early attack.
The majority of your scouting comes from your Hallucinated Phoenix. Your phoenix should be able to get into your opponent?s main base and determine what tech route you see your opponent going.
- If your opponent is expanding quickly, then consider warping in Stalkers non-stop from a proxy Pylon as you all-in your opponent with a Blink all-in. Should you choose to expand instead, you will be slightly behind economically ? but with Blink.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then be sure that you do NOT over produce Stalkers.  Instead, expand and fall back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.
- If your opponent has a Stargate, then be sure to not take damage against early Phoenix or Oracles by initially positioning your Stalkers defensively. You can expand quite easily behind your Blink play and go into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame or all-in your opponent if you spot them taking a fast expansion behind the Stargate.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then consider getting a Robotics Facility instantly in order to make one Observer for detection against DTs. If you are sure your opponent is also opening with Blink, then constantly produce Immortals and defend a natural expansion OR skip the Robotics Facility entirely and try to win the Blink Stalker vs Blink Stalker micro war.

Transitions

This build is a very safe opener that allows you either to all-in your opponent with Blink Stalkers or transitions into a macro game quite easily. However, the actual steps you take to transition into it often depend completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with. This is why scouting with the Hallucinated Phoenix and generally being active on the map with your Blink Stalkers is crucial.
If you choose to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly produce Stalkers 3 at a time from your proxy Pylons and attack as soon as Blink Research is finished (@7:40ish). Bait out a Planetary Nexus and/or kill the Mothership Core and as many Sentries as possible before fully committing to an attack. If your opponent is on one base, you can still expand at home ? using your Sentry to force field the ramp to stop his army from coming down and engaging you with his entire army.
In Twilight vs Stargate macro games, abuse your mobility to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you have a strong midgame Chargelot/Immortal/Archon army ready. In Twilight vs Robotics macro games, again abuse your mobility to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you get a healthy Chargelot/Archon count up.  Keep tabs on your opponent?s tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Twilight vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponent?s potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by getting a Robotics Facility and producing Observers/Immortals or by winning the Blink Stalker vs Blink Stalker position battles in the open field.
The most common way to start the transition into Chargelot/Immortal/Archon is by starting a 2nd Nexus, a Robotics Facility and 2 more Assimilators, a Forge for +1 Ground Weapons, and Zealot Charge research in that order. Add on the Templar Archives and Archons when you can afford it.

Tips

- Once you start your Mothership Core, save your chronoboost so that you can dump it all into Blink Research. Only 1 or 2 chronoboosts should be spent on Warpgate (unless you spot your opponent going for very early aggression).
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial Stalkers to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap?s 3gate All-in).
- Against Stargate play, be sure to position your units to defend your mineral line from potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- If you choose to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly chronoboost Blink and then later your Gateways to get the maximal amount of units out with Blink as soon as possible. Bait out a Planetary Nexus and/or kill the Mothership Core and as many Sentries as possible before fully committing to an attack. If your opponent is on one base, you can still expand at home ? using your Sentry to force field the ramp to stop his army from coming down and engaging you with his entire army.
- If you choose to expand behind this build, do not produce more than 8 Stalkers which you should use to take map control and poke your opponent?s front. Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases. Transitioning into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon unit composition is very strong.

Pros and Cons

This build is a versatile, aggressive build that can pressure your opponent or defend basically any all-in with Blink Stalkers. It gets a fast Hallucinated Phoenix scout your opponent?s main base and let you know if you need detection, should reposition your army, or all-in your opponent.
However, this build requires a lot of scouting information to be executed effectively, so getting a Hallucination into your opponent?s base is crucial.

This build opens with a Stargate for Phoenix and some early ground units to provide the infrastructure necessary to react to every build an opposing Protoss might throw at you.

Benchmark: When your Nexus finishes (@6:45ish), you should have 3 Phoenix, 1 Sentry, 1 Stalker, a Mothership Core, and around 23 Probes.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker back to the protection of your Sentry quickly if you have to defend an early attack.

The majority of your scouting comes from your Phoenix. Your Phoenix should be able to get into your opponent?s main base and determine what tech route you see your opponent going.

- If your opponent is expanding quickly, then feel safe while applying some light harass with your Phoenix. You can dictate the pace of the game by committing to a lot of Phoenix or starting a Twilight Council or Robotics Facility and defaulting back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then be sure that deal some economic damage with your initial Phoenix. Either commit to Phoenix and Void Rays or default back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.
- If your opponent has a Stargate, then be sure to not take damage against early Phoenix or Oracles by initially positioning your units defensively.  Getting a healthy Phoenix lead against your opponent will most likely be enough for you to end the game.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then consider getting a Robotics Facility instantly in order to make one Observer for detection against DTs.  Alternatively, you can position your units with an Oracle at your main ramp and defend for a while. Regardless, do not make more Phoenix and instead transition into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame with your economic advantage.

Transitions

This build is a very safe opener that gives you the scouting capabilities and infrastructure to react to any build your opponent can perform. However, the actual steps you take to transition into a stable midgame often depend completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with. This is why scouting with your Phoenix and generally being active on the map (perhaps with a delayed scouting Probe) is crucial.

In Stargate vs Twilight macro games, harass your opponent with your Phoenix, but transition out of Stargate units into an economic Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame as soon as possible. In Stargate vs Robotics macro games, again harass your opponent to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you get a healthy Chargelot/Archon count up. Keep tabs on your opponent?s tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Stargate vs Stargate macro games, position your Phoenix more defensively while you chronoboost your Phoenix non-stop.

The most common way to start the transition into Chargelot/Immortal/Archon is by starting a Robotics Facility and 2 more Assimilators, followed by a Twilight Council and Forge for +1 Ground Weapons and Zealot Charge. Add on the Templar Archives and Archons when you can afford it.

Tips

- Once you start your Mothership Core, save your chronoboost so that you can dump it all into Phoenix. There is no need to chronoboost Warpgate (unless you spot your opponent going for very early aggression).
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial few Gateway units to stop a Probe from setting up a proxy Pylon and allowing for a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap?s 3gate All-in).
- Against Stargate play, position your Stargate units defensively around your mineral lines to defend potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- Otherwise, always be active with your Phoenixes. The main priority for the Phoenix is to get scouting information, for only when you have a full read on your opponent?s build can you can start chronoboosting probes and enter the midgame.
- Even though you open with a Stargate, transitioning into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon unit composition in the midgame can be very strong.
- When entering the late game, however, be sure to produce Tempest from your inactive Stargate?especially against a Colossus-based opponent.

Pros and Cons

This build is a versatile, economic build that can harass your opponent and provide the scouting information necessary to defend a fast expansion.  Also, your Phoenix can do terrible, terrible damage to Robo-based build such as duckdeok?s 3Gate Robo, and even perform well in a macro game against greedy builds such as NaNiwa?s Safe Expand.

However, this build requires a lot of scouting information to be executed effectively. It also is quite difficult to defend early attacks if you do not kill your opponent?s proxy Pylon.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Dear Phoenix into Colossus', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Forge Fast Expand and then gets several Phoenix for map control and scouting. While you are using the scouting Phoenix, you transition into Colossus play in order to secure your third base and set up a stable midgame OR all-in your opponent with a Stalker/Colossus/Phoenix army.

Scouting

After any early game shenanigans are ruled out, as you have spotted your opponent s third Hatchery going down, the rest of your scouting will come from your Phoenix.

Use your Phoenix to first pick off every Overlord on the map that is undefended by creep/Queens. Then use them to poke around your opponent s base   picking up units not protected by Spore Crawlers/Queens. Be sure to focus on what tech structures you see your opponent making. If you spot a swell of Roaches, stay on 2 bases and consider extra Immortals. If you spot a Hydralisk Den, be sure your Robotics Bay is constantly producing Colossus. If you spot a Spire, instantly get a Twilight Council and go for Blink/+2 Ground Weapons while you resume Phoenix production from your Stargate. You might have to cancel your Colossus production.

Transitions

This build can either all-in off of 2 bases or safely secure a third base to comfortably play a macro game.

If you are choosing to all-in with this build, be sure to go up to 8 Gateways and 3 Colossus with Extended Thermal Lance before moving out. Constantly reinforce with Stalkers as you use your +1/+1, 3-Colossus, 5-Phoenix, 8 Gateway all-in to crush through a Roach/Hydra based army. Watch out for Viper play, though!

If you are choosing to play the macro game, timing your third base is tricky. Dear warps in a lot of Zealots from his 4 Gateways before securing his third if he sees any amount of units on the map with his constant Phoenix scouting. If Dear doesn t see any Roach/Ling force out on the map (as in game 3 of Dear vs Soulkey), then he will take it even before his first Colossus is started. As you take your third base, set up a Cannon defense surrounded by Pylons/Gateways to help with Zergling runbys as you tech up into the late game. Getting a Twilight Council to continue +2 Ground Weapons and Blink is a solid way to both deal with tech switches and set you up for a 3 base attack. Be sure to spend your excess minerals on proxy Pylons and Zealot runbys to keep your opponent s base count in check.

Tips

- Spend all of your early game chronoboost on your two Nexus to maximize Probe production.
- The exact FFE build order you use is up to your personal preference. Dear has performed this build after a Forge First FFE, Nexus First FFE, and a failed attempted Cannon Rush.
- If possible, hide the Stargate somewhere in your base that is less likely to be scouted by an Overlord.
- Chronoboost your Stargate to get out those Phoenix as quickly as possible to deny any Overlord scouting of your follow-up Robotics transition.
A main strength of this build is its versatility, but you can only be versatile if you have the necessary scouting information. Scouting your opponent s tech path and army production with your Phoenix is crucial.
- If you spot your opponent playing very greedy, you can choose to warp-in all of your Zealots from your 4 Gateways aggressively and hit a +1 Zealot/Phoenix timing while continuing the build at home.
- Chronoboost your Robotics Facility to get out your Colossus as quickly as possible and set up a solid midgame army.

Pros and Cons

This build is an incredibly versatile build that can be used as a macro opener or a 2 base all-in. It gets out early Phoenix for scouting and map control while transitioning into a solid ground based Colossus midgame.

This 1gate FE follows up with a 6gate, 2 base Blink Stalker attack, using the Mothership Core for high ground vision and Time Warp.

Benchmark: When Blink finishes (@7:40ish), you should have with 6 Stalkers and 36 Probes at home.

Attack your opponent?s natural/main with your first full warp-in from all 6 Gateways (@8:30ish) with 12 Blink Stalkers and constant Stalker reinforcements.

Scouting

This build is an aggressive opener that makes a lot of units, so you will not have to worry about Probe scouting. Against Reaper play, keep your first Stalker on a common hop-up ledge in order to deny your opponent scouting the Twilight Council. Against other defensive play, poke out to your opponent?s front with your first Stalker and check to see whether your opponent is going for Widow Mines or a quick CC into Bio so you know how to micro when you Blink into his main base with all of your units.

Transitions

This build is a strong 2 base Blink Timing that commits a lots of resources to Stalkers and no resources to upgrades or tech, so your follow-up will be quite slow. If your attack does damage and you keep most of your units alive, then you can start 2 more Assimilators, 2 Forges, and a Templar Archives, in order to transition into a Chargelot/Storm unit composition with Blink Stalkers to help deal with drops. However, if you do not deal some damage with your initial Stalkers, then you will be behind both economically and in tech against an opponent who will have Stimpack and Medivacs soon to follow.

Tips

- Do not bother Probe scouting early on because you can do this build against nearly everything your opponent chooses to open with.
- With your initial Stalkers, either protect your main base from a Reaper scouting your Twilight Council or move out and poke up at your opponent?s base for some early scouting intel.
- The limiting factor with this build is Blink Research?s build time and finishing your 6 Gateways, so be sure to Chronoboost Blink Research constantly in order to attack as soon as possible.
- Keep your Mothership Core out of harm?s way.  Use its 14 sight range for high ground vision, but do not commit the Mothership Core in the attack because without high ground vision, your attack will most likely fail.
- Do not forget to use your Mothership Core?s Time Warp ability to help pick off SCVs or Bio units that are out of position.
- Do NOT over-commit your Stalkers in a risky blink. Only aggressively blink to get up to a high ground or to pick off a Siege Tank/Widow Mine before it activates.
- Constantly warping-in more Stalkers to reinforce your army and add strength to the attack is key to crushing through your opponent?s defenses.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong build because of how quickly you get both high ground vision with your Mothership Core and enough Blink Stalkers to do real damage ? after opening with a 1gate FE. While your opponent might have Stimpack done in time for the attack, you can still beat your opponent in the open field if you use Time Warp and Blink appropriately.

However, this build commits a lot of resources to the attack, so transitioning into standard play will be much further behind if you had just rushed for High Templars and upgrades.

The opening is pretty simple and straight forward and easy to execute. The dark shrine can be proxied or it can be put in base. On 4 player maps its best to proxy it since you can put the proxy in a base far away from theirs while already on your scouting path so it's pretty convenient and you can pull some cute mindgames with a fake chrono on the twilight to fake blink if they scout you.

This build is pretty much safe vs any opening. Vs fast WG attacks you use overcharge to buy enough time to get the DT's out so you can defend and harass at the same time and abuse their lack of detection. If they're smart they will see your lack of units and start a late robo or forge, however you can usually keep it from finishing with how early your DTs come out.

Vs standard robo expands your nexus will be a little bit later, however you can either make up for this by using warp prism/DT harass or doing the blink follow up to abuse their low production capability.

Vs blink you obviously just kinda win so that's always nice.

Stargate openers are the only real problem. If they go phoenix they will usually scout with the first one and will be able to pick apart what you're doing. In which case you can just play more conservatively and get extra gates before you expand to be sure you don't die to a phoenix/gateway all in. Use the DT to determine if he's expanding or not so you can react properly. If they bank the phoenix then you basically just win.

If they go for oracle pressure they sometimes can just win if they're good at identifying early and remember to leave an oracle at home. Otherwise you can usually hold it off decently well but it is definitely the most burdensome to deal with (besides proxy oracle, which just blows in general.)

If they go DT's too then you have that weird thing where you just kinda continue normally as if nothing happened. That's why you get the robo obviously so you don't die vs their potential DTs.

This build opens with a 3 Stalker Rush to take map control, and follows up with a 1base 3gate Robo in order to pressure you opponent, get detection, and play safe against Blink/Stargate builds. This pressure build produces somewhat stable macro games if you react appropriately to your scouting information.

Scouting

For all early game scouting, please refer to the Scouting section of the 3 Stalker Rush build.

After your initial units have scouted around your side of the map, the majority of your scouting will come from your 3gate pressure at your opponent?s base.

- If your opponent is fast expanding, then attempt to cancel the Nexus before it finishes. Warp in more units at your proxy Pylon for extra pressure.
- If your opponent has just as many (or almost as many) Gateway units as you, immediately fall back and begin Immortal production. Against either Gateway attacks or Blink All-ins, you need a high Immortal count in order to defend.
- If your opponent does not have as many Gateway units as you, then push up the ramp and attempt to kill his army. Do NOT over-commit once your opponent has activated Photon Overcharge. If you cannot push up his ramp, then warp-in a Sentry or two at his natural and set up a contain while you expand back at home. If during the contain a Stargate unit flies into your base, be sure to activate your Photon Overcharge in order to keep your Probes alive.

Transitions

Once you have set up or a contain or you are forced to retreat back home, be sure to setup your natural expansion. Going into the macro game, however, the actual unit composition of your army very often depends completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with.  If your opponent stays on one base for too long, then throw down more Gateways, constantly make units, and prepare to defend your natural with Stalkers, Immortals, and your Planetary Nexus. In Robotics vs Stargate macro games, quickly switch into Blink or double Stargate play of your own so as to not lose against any Void Ray based armies. In Robotics vs Robotics macro games, Immortal count and/or Colossus count are the most important things. Keep tabs on your opponent?s tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Robotics vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponent?s potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by producing Immortals+Gateway units or Colossus for defense.

Tips

- Split your initial chronoboost on Probes and Warpgate Research in the early game so that you are not economically behind but still have a quick Warpgate attack.
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial 3 Stalkers to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap?s 3gate All-in).
- Against fast tech plays, your initial 3gate pressure should give you information on both the type and timing of your opponent?s attack. Be sure not to over-commit your Stalkers here, however, for Blink or Immortal all-ins will be able to hold your attack and counter-attack with a lot of force if you are careless with your initial units.
- Against Blink play (or your opponent has a lot of Stalkers when you pressure), be sure to pull back immediately and start Immortal production.
- Against Stargate play, use your Photon Overcharge to push back any Oracles or Phoenix if your Stalker army is out of position.
- Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very versatile, safe build that takes advantage of early Gateway units to apply pressure as well as defend every sort of all-in that can hit you. It also gets detection and Immortals for defense against ground-based all-ins, so very often you have a more stable opening than most other PvP builds.

However, this build forces you to be active on the map with your initial units.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'DeMusliM Reaper FE', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This HotS Reaper FE, optimized by Flash and DeMusliM, gets out exactly one Reaper for scouting and a ridiculously fast Engineering Bay for an early +1 Infantry Attack in order to hit a 10 minute timing with +1/+1, Stimpack, and Medivacs.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (opening with a Reaper FE means that you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they expand (or note if they do not get a fast expansion by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Also, if you do not know whether or not your opponent has built a Stargate, taking advantage of your ridiculously fast Engineering Bay to build a Missile Turret is not a bad idea too.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and Medivacs.  After this build, secure your 3rd Command Center, continue your upgrades with +2 Infantry Attack, build 6 more Barracks (for a total of 8), and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to go into a strong, late game army. Your fast third Command Center and early upgrades means that your late game army will be much stronger than your opponents assuming that you are able to deny their third base with your initial Medivac poke.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important  be sure to mine exactly 100 Gas so that you have enough for the Reaper and Reactor and no more.  Getting your natural Command Center up before the 2nd Supply Depot is a major strength of this build.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add a 2nd Bunker at the front, and consider getting a Missile Turret in each mineral line. 
- Oracles, even with an expansion, massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you have to instantly get out one Missile Turret per mineral line.
- The gas timings of this build are somewhat more delayed than what you might be used to if you usually play with a gasless 1rax FE.  Therefore, be sure to cut all Marauder production until after your Starport has completed.
- Try not to take any huge engages against your Protoss opponent with your initial Medivacs unless you are sure you can do damage.  With only 2 Barracks producing units, and such a fast 3rd Command Center, your army is not designed to outright win the game  rather to further your economic and upgrade advantage in order to win the game at a later point.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because it gives you the economy and infrastructure on par with a Wings of Liberty style 1rax FE. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Not to mention the fact that you also get a ridiculously early Engineering Bay in order to kick start your Bio upgrades very early. This build also takes no detours and goes directly into Bio+Medivac play, so your Stim+Medivac aggression happens much sooner than if you go for early Widow Mines.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes, especially if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that with such a low Marine count in the early game, fast Oracles can do a lot of damage if your scouting/Missile Turret timing is not perfect.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Bunker,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,EngineeringBay,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SCV,OrbitalCommand,Barracks,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,Factory,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Refinery,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,StimPack,SCV,SCV,Starport,DoubleMarines,Marine,ReactorOnFactory,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,ScannerSweep,Marauder,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,InfantryArmorLevel1,CallMule,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marauder,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Armory,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,CommandCenter,CallMule,SCV,SCV,DoubleMedivacs,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CombatShield', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:35:29 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'FanTaSy Mine Drop into Banshee', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This aggressive build hits your opponent with relentless harassment, either outright winning the game or giving you a considerable economic advantage before even entering the midgame. Also, with Widow Mine and Banshee play, this build force a lot of scans  giving you another sort of economic advantage going into the midgame.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your 1st Refinery so as to check whether your opponent is opening Reapers or not. Against a Reaper player, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe and try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or an expansion at your natural with your first Marines.

Your next scout will come with your Widow Mine Drop. With this drop you can check what your opponents opener is. Against a Banshee player, you can following through with the build and trying to out-micro him in Banshee vs Banshee harass, or you can cancel your banshee and start a Viking and Engineering Bay for a Turret to play safe. Against a Hellbat Dropping player, make a few more Widow Mines to position them defensively against any incoming drop as you use your Widow Mine Drop and incoming Banshee to out-harass him. Against a player going for a similar Widow Mine Drop, you can either pull back and try to defend or attempt to do more SCV damage with your drop than he does with his.

Finally, when your first Banshee starts its harass, you will get a good look at everything else your opponent is doing when trying to transition into the midgame. Keep an eye out for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either Marine/Tank or Mech play quite easily.

When transitioning into Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production early in order to have a safe defense and later strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use.
- Keep your eyes peeled for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop a drop or Banshee. Do NOT drop on top of an active Widow Mine.
- With your initial Widow Mine drop, avoid Turrets at all costs. The main purpose of the drop is to force multiple scans, with a side goal of dealing crippling economic damage.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that were already weakened by the initial drop before attacking any of the full health SCVs.
- If your opponent has a Missile Turret already set up in his mineral line, then do not worry. Instead, camping a Terrans production with a Widow Mine and several Marines can be just as effectiveespecially with the Banshee follow-up that hits soon after.
- Always favor keeping your Medivac and Banshee alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural. You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very strong, aggressive play style that opens up with unrelenting harassment before even entering the midgame. With a Widow Mine drop and Banshee follow-up, you can kill many SCVs and also force your opponent to scan often  giving you another type of economic advantage. Finally, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for opening with a 1/1/1 grants you the freedom to go into nearly anything.

However, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades. Also, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,Factory,Refinery,CallMule,SCV,Marine,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,Starport,WidowMine,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,WidowMine,Medivac,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnStarport,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,Banshee,CloakingField,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,Banshee,TechLabOnFactory,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:35:29 PM;

This gas first Banshee opener used by Polt and many other top level Korean Terrans opens with the fastest Cloaked Banshees possible. The Banshee(s) are used to stay safe against early attacks as well as harass your opponent, in order to get an economic advantage going into the midgame.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your Orbital Command to check whether or not your opponent is opening with Reapers. Against an opponent opening Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe; thus, you should try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or expanded at your natural with your first few Marines.

Your next scout will come with your Banshee. With this Banshee, you can check what your opponents opener is. Against another Banshee player, follow-up your first Banshee with a Raven (and then potentially Viking if extra anti-air is needed). Against a Hellbat dropping player, make a few Widow Mines to burrow defensively against any incoming drop, as you use several Banshees to out-harass him. Against a player going for a Widow Mine Drop, position your Marines defensively at home and be sure to have enough scans to deal with his Widow Mines. Building a Raven might be useful, but not until after you have 2 Banshees with which to harass your opponent.

Finally, be sure to keep an eye out on what midgame transition your opponent is doing. Look for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either all-in, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play quite easily.

For an all-in transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory and start Siege Tank production instantly. When you hit 2 or 3 Siege Tanks, grab all of your Marines (>20), your Banshees/Vikings, and attempt to break your opponents front with a slow siege push.

It is possible to go into Marine/Tank or Mech after a 3 Command Center follow-up if you are sure your opponent will not be going for any more early game pressure. Start a Raven in order to save enough minerals to afford 2 Command Centers and then transition into either Marine/Tank or Mech just as below.

When transitioning into macro Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production after you start a 2nd Command Center. That way you have enough defense early and later can have a strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use. Against 2rax Reaper, you should delay your Tech lab until your Factory has completed at least one Hellion. Otherwise you might straight up die before you even start your first Banshee.
- Watch for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop your Banshee as you enter your opponents base.  Cloak your Banshee as soon as you see any potential for burrowed Widow Mines.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that are undefended by a Turret. If you are transitioning to a 1/1/1 all-in, then be sure to target-fire Marines as well, for this directly strengthens your attack.
- Always favor keeping your Banshee(s) alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two. You can also repair a weakened Banshee at home with SCVs if you can keep it alive.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural.  You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This gas first Banshee build is an aggressive opener in TvT. Also, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for you are able to transition into an all-in, 3 Command Center play, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play. Also, this build requires a lot less APM than other TvT builds, so it can be very useful for lower league players.

However, this build is extraordinarily weak against early Reaper builds because you open with so few Marines. Also, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind your opponent in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades, especially if they open with a fast expansion. Finally, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,SCV,Factory,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,Refinery,SCV,Marine,Starport,TechLabOnFactory,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,LandStarportOnTechLab,Banshee,CloakingField,SCV,CallMule,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,WidowMine,SCV,Banshee,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:35:30 PM;

This gas first Banshee opener used by INnoVation and many other top level Korean Terrans opens with the fastest Cloaked Banshees possible. The Banshee(s) are used to stay safe against early attacks as well as harass your opponent, in order to get an economic advantage going into the midgame.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your Orbital Command to check whether or not your opponent is opening with Reapers. Against an opponent opening Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe; thus, you should try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or expanded at your natural with your first few Marines.

Sacrifice your hellion on 35 supply to get intel + allow yourself to get more scvs while supply depot is building.

Against another Banshee player, follow-up your first Banshee with a Raven (and then potentially Viking if extra anti-air is needed). Against a Hellbat dropping player, make a few Widow Mines to burrow defensively against any incoming drop, as you use several Banshees to out-harass him. Against a player going for a Widow Mine Drop, position your Marines defensively at home and be sure to have enough scans to deal with his Widow Mines. Building a Raven might be useful, but not until after you have 2 Banshees with which to harass your opponent.

This 2 base, Hatchery-tech Roach-Speedling all-in crushes through Void Ray-less Stargate or heavy Gateway Protoss openers, both out of a Gateway Expand or Forge Fast Expand.

Scouting

Send your first Overlord to scout your opponent?s natural wall to spot for a Forge Fast Expand or Gateway Expand, and then send it to a safe area for a later 7:00 scout.  Consider using your 2nd Overlord to guard your natural expansion against Cannon Rushes. Your next Overlords can be placed around your opponent?s main or natural base as backup scouts or for vision of their 3rd base.
Use your initial Zerglings to scout around the map for Probes and proxy Pylons. Keep a Zergling outside his front to scout for any early pokes, and avoid any Stalkers or the Mothership Core whenever possible.
The majority of your scouting will come from the Roach/Ling all-in. Note whether or not your opponent has opened with a Stargate, Robotics Facility, or Gateway-heavy army, and react accordingly.

Transitions

This build is a 2 base Roach/Ling all-in off of only 27 Drones, so there is no well defined transition. That being said, if the attack is not going well, be sure to pull back and keep your units alive, instantly resume Droning, and attempt to secure a third base and 3rd Queen.  Going for Lair and Roach Speed or Hydralisks is probably your best way to defend the inevitable counter-attack, but you might be too far behind (based entirely on how much damage your all-in did) for it to be enough.

Tips

- Be active on the map with your initial few Zerglings in order to deny vision of the fact that you do not have a 3rd Hatchery (and especially that you have mined more than 100 gas just for Metabolic Boost).
- Roaches take up a lot of supply, so be sure to start several Overlords BEFORE you need to make the 8 Roaches.
- During the all-in, keeping up on your injects so that you have enough Speedling reinforcements could be the difference between a close game and an easy slaughter.

Pros and Cons

This is a very strong 2 base all-in that uses Roach/Ling to crush your opponent before the midgame has even started. It also requires little scouting and little APM to perform well, so it is a great build for newer players to perform as well.
However, if your opponent spots your lack of third base early on, they should have enough time to wall off their natural with Photon Cannons if they opened with a FFE or get out enough Sentries if they opened with a Gateway Expand.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Harstem 1 gate FE to Blink-Colossus', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a 1gate FE, and transitions directly into both Blink and Colossi. With these two tools you can safely secure your main and natural from both frontal pushes and backdoor drops.

Benchmark: When your first Colossus finishes (@9:00ish), you should have 1 Colossus, 3 Stalkers, a Sentry, a Mothership Core, 2 Observers, and around 50 Probes.

Scouting

This build is a safe build that gets detection and a lot of early game Stalkers, so Probe scouting is unnecessary. Use your initial Stalkers to ward off any of your opponent?s Reaper(s) or scout the front of your opponent?s base if they are opening with a Command Center First.

Most of your scouting will come from your 2 Observers. Send the first directly to your opponent?s main in order to spot what infrastructure is being built. Send the second to a common attack or drop path so that you have vision of when your opponent is moving out.

Against early Widow Mine drops, position your units defensively and consider delaying Colossus production in favor of more Observers.

Transitions

With Blink, Colossus, and Observers, you should be able to safely secure your main and natural expansions. Against bio play, consider getting 4 or 5 more Gateways while continuing your upgrades and taking your 3rd base as soon as you are safe to.

Alternatively, you are also able to go for a 2 Base, +2 Blink Stalker/Colossus all-in with this build.  Simply get your Ground Weapons upgrades instead of Ground Armor, and throw down 7 more Gateways after you start your Colossus production in order to break your opponent with simply Stalkers and Colossi.

Tips

- Chronoboost your Nexii constantly in order to get an economic advantage.
- Use your initial Stalker(s) to ward off any opposing Reapers and/or take a Xel?Naga Watchtower to see a push coming.
- Position your Robotics Facility, Forge, and Twilight Council in a central location to prevent them from being killed during a drop.
- Your Observers are the main way you can position your army to adequately defend multi-pronged aggression ? replace them if they are scanned and lost.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with both Blink Stalkers and Colossi, rushing for all the tools you need to defend Terran aggression.  With strong upgrades and a mobile unit composition, this build allows you to enter the midgame ridiculously quickly.

You use the zealot to help ferry the probe across the map and keep the pylon alive so you can get a zealot warp in and then have your oracle follow up afterwords. You either should target and timewarp the queens he has trying to defend the 3rd, and then clean them up with the oracle, or bait them all down and then go in to a queenless mineral line to get a ton of drone kills. It's all up to your judgement.

After that youcgo for very fast charge, archons, and +1 attack and then zealot/archon timing to kill the 4th base of the zerg. It hits at such an awkward time that the zerg never expects it and you're taking a 3rd behind it as well so they don't even think you're going to attack.

The other reason it's so good though is because zealot/archon at that stage in the game is probably the best unit comp per cost vs anything the zerg could have made. If they try to go formass lingsat that stage to hold off the zealot pressure, then zealot archon is obviously going to destroy that. If they go forhydrasthe count won't be high enough and as long as you can trap them with FF's you'll destroy them as well. If they goroachesthen you probably can't end them with this push, but if you can get good forcefields and get the zealots in the faces of the roaches then you'll do quite well since zealots are actually better vs roaches if they can get in their face (which is what charge + FF does). If they goswarm hostsyou'll hit right as they're popping usually so they'll be in quite low numbers. You can do a good amount of damage before you have to pull back to an observer from the robo you made while pushing. The only big trouble with this build is mutas, however like the swarm hosts you'll be hitting as they pop. With 3-4 archons and a wave of stalkers afterwords you can easily deal with low numbers of mutas. If they are able to get a good 12-13 at once you're gonna have to back up and immediately make 2 extra stargates and start phoenix production.

If you don't end the game with the zealot/archon push then you can simply transition into whatever tech is required vs what the zerg chose. You can start warp prisms with the robo you made and then go into colossus and blink, or you can make warp prisms and continue down TC path with storm and then add some void rays.

Build is extremely aggressive and start off aggressive early on as well. In this one the initial zealot and MSCore are sent directly to the zergs 3rd to do some harassment. The whole goal of this build is to keep the drone count as low as possible before doing the full immortal/sentry push and this is stage 1 of that goal. You send the zealot/MSCore to his 3rd to maybe pick off a drone or even a queen but also to force an early set of lings. Losing the zealot will be almost inevitable however do NOT lose the MSCore. That will make your little poke 100% not worth it. You may not always be able to do this push as sometimes the zerg will open gas early and will have speed out by this time, so make sure you're scouting to see exactly when the gas goes down.

Part 2 of the "keep the drones low" goal is with an early warp prism pressure. Most immortal/sentry all ins don't have this step in it, they just go right for the attack and let the zerg drone and make whatever he wants before the attack. This little drop of 1 immortal and 2 sentries (preferably behind the mineral line in an abusable location) forces even MORE things that aren't drones as well as allows you to kill a decent amount. If you're good with your micro as well you can keep the drop going by going into the main and doing a FF drop and warping in (as your first 4 gateways will be done at this time) however that option may not always be available. Also be sure to bring the MSCore with this drop, if things go terrible wrong you can always recall which is why it's important to not lose the MSCore in the initial poke.

All the while this pressure is happening you're going up to 3 immortals and 9 gateways and making a ton of zealot/sentry and moving across the map. If you can keep him pre occupied with the warp prism all the while you're moving across the map then that's even better. However your goal is complete at this point.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'HerO greedy blink into DT drop', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'Early game opening

The build starts off very standard. It's a normal 1 gate FE blink opening. You get your twilight council on 29 supply after 1 stalker and then a 2nd stalker afterwords. Lately people have only been going 2 stalkers in the early game instead of 3 so that way they can fit in 2 gateways at 36 supply while opening blink as well. This would make it so that the 2 extra gates (3 in total) would be finished right when WG was done. Before that, literally everyone opened 3 stalkers but with a later 2nd and 3rd gate that didn't quite finish when WG was done. This build is a best of both worlds and what I assume might become the standard now for defensive blink openings. herO goes for a 2nd gate at 34 supply instead of 2nd and 3nd at 36, which allows him to still get the 3rd stalkerfrom the gateway. Then once WG is finished researching, he warps in 2 more to get that nice number of 5 which is what you would get normally anyway. So you basically end up at the same thing (just with 1 less gateway since you aren't planning on being super aggressive with the blink) but now with 3 stalkers early to help defend instead of 2. It's a small little variation, but a rather useful one to give you that nice defense of 3 stalkers before WG is finished while still ending up with a nicely timed tech and gateway count.

One other important thing to note: herO onlychronoboosts his blink research ONCE. Yeah...only once. That's very rare. He instead puts all chrono into his probes to get full saturation and simply waits for blink to finish. So basically you can completely focus on chronoing probes if you want. If you forget to chrono blink once it doesn't even matter cause apparently not even herO does that sometimes with this build.

Extra tech and mid game transition

With every defensive blink opener we need a robo right? Luckily for us, herO gets the timing for the robo down absolutely perfectly. Literally the earliest we could need an observer after a standard 1 rax reaper FE is around 8 minutes. When does the observer come out of this 6:35 timed robo? 8 minutes. This will allow you to defend any 1 rax reaper FE into factory builds with relative ease (as long as your control and map awareness are on point) and give you a strong edge going into the mid game.

All the while this is going on, a very sneaky and early timed dark shrine has been placed at 7:30. This is earlier than the Trap build I used in the past (which went down at about 8 minutes), which adds to the greediness of this build. This earlier dark shrine allows you to time up a nicely executeddual pronged attackwith7 stalkers and 3 DTs in a warp prism. This is showcased brilliantly vs Flash from Proleague. As you drop the DTs in, you also do some poking with the blink stalkers at the bunker or any SCVs near the front. Or you can do it visa versa. Distract and fake blink all in by poking at front bunker --> drop DTs into main. He continues doing this for quite a long time which allows him to do the next step in the build.

While this DT/blink harass is going on, herO makes some decisions that REALLY enforces the greedy aspect of the build. Not only does he get a robo bay AND two forges during the 8th minute, he also EXPANDS at 9:20.He is heavily relying on his blink/DT harass to scare of the Terran to allow him to get away with this.He even starts +1/+1 BEFORE a colossus. At 11 minutes into the game his unit count is literally 61 probes, 1 DT, 1 colossus, 7 stalkers, 1 warp prism and a MSCore. If the Terran makes a strong defense of the blink/DT harass then a counter attack is extremely lethal and potentially game ending. If you don't feel safe being this greedy, then by all means delay the 3rd base and get a few gates before hand while you get a colossus and a sentry or two. Most terrans will want to be attacking you more often than not so it's better to play a little safer on ladder anyway. This build obviously is being done this greedy due to the fact that herO is playing against Flash.

Late game

The build transitions quite easily into late game. After your 3rd is saturated you get a nice gateway explosion of up to about 12-14 or so. You start +2/+2 right when 1/1 is done and then a Templar Archives shortly after for storm. herO also gets warp prism speed for some random reason. I guess he just feels he has the money to get it so he does. I personally would prefer observer speed since it's a little more helpful (since warp prisms are fairly fast already now) and if you're going to spend your money on something like that at that point in the game, it might as well be for observer speed since it's so vital later on.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Hero Aggresive Stargate', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Gateway Expand and then transitions into light Gateway pressure in order to start the macro game with an economic advantage. Also, this build gets both a Stargate and a third base quite quickly for a Chargelot/Void Ray or pure Sky-toss unit composition in the late game.

Scouting

After the early game, be sure to scout for early Roaches from your opponent. If your opponent is performing an early 2 base all-in, then warp-in Sentries and make Void Rays from your Stargate instead of being aggressive with your initial 6 units. If your opponent has taken a third base or shows NO signs of aggression, then be sure to set up your proxy Pylon as soon as you can for the attack to hit before Zergling Speed can finish.

When you are attacking with your initial 6 units (2 Stalkers, 3 Zealots, and Mothership Core), your opponent must defend with whatever units he has. With this extra scouting information, be sure to react appropriately. If your opponent has opened with Roaches, then be sure to start Void Ray production earlier. If your opponent has opened without Zergling speed, then be sure to continue the 3gate attack, reinforcing with Zealots and Stargate units when you can. If your opponent has opened with Zergling speed, then be sure not to over-commit to the attack; rather, pull back and start your Stargate production appropriately. Also note that if you kill a Queen or two, you should reinforce with an Oracle first due to your opponent?s lack of anti-air.

Depending on how your attack has gone (especially if your opponent defended with opening fast Roaches), then you might not feel safe to take such a quick third Nexus. Instead, start a Forge and a few Cannons at your natural in order to play safe.

Transitions

This build is a macro build, so don?t commit multiple warp-ins to the initial 3gate attack unless you are confident in its success. Following up with the appropriate Stargate units and taking your 3rd Nexus/extra Assimilators is much more important than dealing a killing blow with these units.

HerO follows up this attack with a Forge and several Cannons at both his natural expansion and 3rd Nexus. He then starts 2 more Stargates and both Assimilators at his 3rd Nexus in order to make a mass Void Ray army. With his economic advantage, he ensures that no standard Roach/Hydra timing attacks can kill his Sky-toss army until it is already too powerful.

However, it is also possible to play with an sOs style transition, favoring mass Chargelot and only several Void Rays in order to make a beefier ground army.  Again, start a Forge (or two) for Cannons at the natural expansion and 3rd Nexus as well as for Ground Upgrades. Then start at least 4 Gateways for a healthy Gateway count and a Twilight Council to begin Zealot Charge before taking your 5th and 6th Assimilators at your 3rd Nexus.  Add in High Templar/Archons instead of more Void Rays as your gas count allows it.

Tips

- Because this is a macro build with only light pressure, commit almost all of your chronoboost on both your Nexus throughout the build.
- With your initial Stalkers, be sure to clear any stray Zerglings around your base that might scout your build. Then defend the building proxy Pylon until your first warp-in.
- As soon as you start your Stargate, you need to send out a Probe in order to set up an aggressive proxy Pylon
- During your 3gate attack, use your Stalkers to target-fire any Queens your opponent might use to defend with. If you can kill a Queen or two, then follow-up with an Oracle to deal a lot of damage. Also, be sure to use Time Warp on any Queens or Roaches so as to minimize your opponent?s mobility in the fight.
- Do NOT over-commit multiple warp-ins to the 3gate attack unless you are confident that you can do damage. Each warp-in that you use slows down your 3rd Nexus timing by at least 20 seconds.
- If your opponent defends with fast Roaches, then consider starting a Forge and several Cannons at your natural expansion before you take the 3rd Nexus.

Pros and Cons

This macro build is strong because it opens with some light aggression for harassment and scouting, while taking a rather quick 3rd Nexus behind it. Also, it is a safe Gateway Expand build because your 3gates and Stargate together are enough to defend most early Zerg all-ins. Finally, this build uses a Stargate for some decent harassment, a deterrent for Mutalisks, and an opening for a strong unit-composition in the midgame.

However, this build requires solid macro while simultaneously performing a timing attack, so may be quite hard for newer players.

It's been done before but recently it's become very popular in Korea. So the idea behind this is that you get the best of both worlds. You get a very fast nexus for early eco as well as a fast gateway for early tech. Soit's basically like a gate FE combined with a nexus first. If you notice they're going for anearly poolthen you can justchrono zealots and do a kind of delayed gate FEand be fine, and if not then you just continue as normal being nice and greedy with your early nexus and tech.

After the opening then it's a super safe build since you get early sentries and 2 gates to wall off. You shouldn't really lose to any thing once you get the wall up. You then transition into a few more sentries and gates while taking a 3rd and youpressure him with sentry stalker. This part of the build is very similar to the old PartinG fake 3 base 7 gate build, however you're still macroing behind it.

The goal with this attack is to justforce units and make him think you're all inning(which you aren't) and if you catch him off guard you can definitely kill the 3rd. It's just to set up for the next attack that comes.

Transition to mid game

The transition is quite simple and the "in" thing to do right now. You simplyget +2 and blink and then attack. Basically every Korean protoss is doing this right now and it's winning games left and right. There's not really a good answer to this for zerg other than getting vipers which are easily dealt with by high templar. So with a critical mass of blink/sentry you can cut up roach/hydra indefinitely and you should be able to win whatever fight. It's also great for cutting up small spaces so you can snipe hatches better.

Whatever damage you did with the first push should give you a timing to hit with the 2nd push. So long as youdon't over commit and lose more than you should(recall when you think you're starting to lose too much) you should be in good shape.If they're super preparedthen you simplyuse the 2nd push as a pokeand threaten to kill him while you're simply macroing up on 3 bases going into templar tech and harassing with the warp prism.

You open with a forge expand, do a normal stargate oracle opening and instead of transitioning into robo you just get a twilight council after your 4gates and 3rd base. You then go up to 10 gates in total (4 starting, 2 at 3rd, 4 at 10:00) and a robo to round out your composition. The oracle should keep him back for a bit in the early game as well as give you enough information to know exactly what kind of follow up he is going for. The 4gates before 3rd and 6 sentries off of them will give you a nice defense vs early roach and or ling play to try and cancel your 3rd. Sometimes you'll have to give it up, however with the proper response (shown in one of the linked VODs) you can still end up winning.

The cool thing about this build is how versatile it is. Like I said, it has early pressure (which most fast +2 blink builds don't) while still being able to defend at home with sentries. It also deals with any sort of follow up very well with little deviation. If they're massingroaches(but a little bit later) you can just add in someimmortalswith your main blink/sentry force. If they gohydrasyou can go into colossiwhileabusing forcefieldsto take their armyin chunksif they attack earlier. If they gomutasthen you simply spam the fuck out of your warp gates with non stop stalkersand thrust them down his throat. You might need some cannons at home to defend if they go for a base trade but you should be able to just break them if you attack quickly enough.

Since the swarm host nerf you hardly even see them anymore. They aren't hard to deal with at all. You can respond in the same way said below, but it's not nearly as difficult as described.

Them goingswarm hostsis when it gets a little trickier. You'll need tobuy as much time as possiblewith your blink/sentry force while you tech up todouble robo colossi. This includes sectioning off their 4th base to try and get a snipe on it, bouncing around creep and keeping it as far back as possible, also getting a warp prism while the robo bay is making to do zealot warp ins while attacking at an exterior base. It' requires some decent multitasking as well as a good understanding on how to play the mass harass style vs swarm hosts.

Otherwise if they just kind of sit back and macro in a non swarm host way, then you just do some harass with the blink/sentry squad and warp prisms while going up to colossi anyway.

The zealot/stalker poke at the beginning this time is more to focus down queens than anything else, even if you get the health on it low that's better than nothing because the plan is to follow up directly after with the oracle. An oracle beats a queen one on one, however it will have low health, so if you can lower the queens health initially you can snipe it very quickly with the oracle after and get some juicy drone kills. Or best case scenario you actually kill the queen with the zealot/stalker and you just get a crap ton of drone kills.

This part is quite micro intensive so I would suggest practicing the timings of this build vs the AI multiple times first so you can get the timings for all the gateways down.

If he scouts early and sees your proxy, you should go with the first zealot otherwise he's going to have more than enough time to prepare for the 2nd one. If he doesn't scout and you can get 2 zealots out then wait for the 2nd one so that way it still hits with a surprise but has the ability to deal twice the damage. From there you should chrono out as many stalkers as you feel necessary. If you think you're pressure is being held easily then stop making them and focus on a transition back home. If you are dealing a lot of damage then continue chronoing them out.

Back home herO goes for 2 more gates for even more aggression once warp gate is done (and ends up winning the game with it) as well as a robo for protection vs DTs and for a stable follow up if the 3gate follow up does not kill him.

The reason for robo over anything else is because:

He saw a twilight council so the threat of DTs is there. Also his twilight would be too late for blink vs blink so going for immortals is safer.Stargate always has the possibility of losing to DT and blink (especially since blink is so common now and a common follow up to a held proxy)DT is too easily expected after a failed proxy

So robo is the safest option. If you scout certain things like a stargate or robo then going for blink or oracle respectively will obviously be good in those situations.

Since the ramp is so small you can easily forcefield it off and be slightly greedier with your opening (so long as your reaction times are good) and the phoenix cater to the large amount of drop area.

The build opens with a standard oracle for some harassment and scouting. Very normal and cool. It goes into a fast 5 phoenix after the oracle to further harass (if you want to reveal them) and also shut down drops early on to keep you safe to tech up to templar. HerO does both. I've seen him reveal them after 3 to start doing some harassment with the oracle (usually if they open delayed mines so you can pick up the mines and continue harassing) or he will keep them hidden like vs Polt (someone he knows loves his drops) so you can catch some medivacs for free.

After that you go into charge and an archon or two to get your 3rd up. This is going to be the hard part to stay stabilized. This is when terran will try to really pressure you to keep you off 3 bases and away from storm. This is why HerO gets a decent gateway count before taking the 3rd as you will need as many units as possible to keep them away and your 3rd safe.

Once the 3rd is set and you have storm you should have a decent time keeping terran back as you try a storm drop or two while you tech up to colossi as well to abuse any lack of vikings. I prefer to add a 2nd robo as well when the colossi tech up starts so that way you can really hit with a hard transition of suddenly 2 and suddenly 4 colossi instead of just getting one and slowly go up. It's much easier for terran to transition himself when you only do 1 colossus at a time so if you do double robo you can open a timing window for yourself if the terran isn't scouting/reacting properly.

Like I said it's a bit challenging butif you want you can just incorporate the main ideasof the build into your own standard robo openings that you're familiar and comfortable with. The build starts with a fancy 2 gas opener with probes being rallied in 1 at a time after you have full mineral saturation. If anyone remembers a long time ago the SaSe aggressive 3 gate opening that Day9 did a daily on, it's very similar to how the gasses were filled in that build. Whether or not it's better to do it this way or to just do a normal 2 in each or 1 with 3, I don't really know. I'm sure you can get to the same out come with whatever gas opener you're familiar with but if you wanna be try hard and feel cool then go ahead and try this method. I personally found it quite smooth when I tried it.

Now the build starts with a normal robo timing just like any other standard opening. The natural gasses are a bit earlier however since the build is quite gas intensive (you'll also need the extra gas for 2 sentries while teching up heavily to be able to defend). That's another thing you can simplify if you'd like if you don't think you'll remember to fill the gas up later on. Once the robo bay is done you'll get your first colossus but instead of getting range you get warp prism speedto aid in your colossus drop harassment. Since we aren't committing fully to colossus we won't need range this early and instead we put that gas towards a fast twilight council to go into storm for a 2nd form of harassment in the storm drop.

Once your harassment with the colossus starts you should be getting a few extra gateways to prepare for any medivac timing the terran may want to use. Your extra resources should also be put into some immortals while you wait for your tech to get up. You should also be sure towarp in 2 HT's when you start storm so by the time storm is done you can immediately go and use them for the storm drop.So once storm is done, bring the colossus home and switch it for the HT's and go for round 2 of your wonderful harassment. You can also warp in archons at home to help defend and bolster your army. You'll have quite the beefy army with immortals and archons and storm with 1 colossus. If you remember the old rangeless colossus into storm builds, this is very similar to that except that you're doing harassment with the first colossus.

From the storm drop you simply add on more gates as you feel necessary and get the upgrades and charge going and transition into a normal macro game. You get your 3rd when you feel safe and you can transition into 2 robo colossi whenever you feel comfortable to throw the terran off even more.

Simplifications/Alternative Follow ups

If you feel the colossus drop into storm drop is a little too much for you (opening storm these days isn't always the easiest thing in the world) then you can very easily just continue down the colossus tech route.The extra resources you will bank by not going twilight tech can be used for earlier gateways or earlier double forge. Or you can go into twilight still and go for blink for an easier drop defense option.

Something else you can do is do a big7gate colossus all in like Classic did vs Polt on Nimbus at Blizzcon.

If you still want to go down the storm route but feel like you're kind of skimping on defense by loading your first to HT's to do a drop, then you can also easily justplay more passive after the colossus drop.You can play it like the old rangeless colossus into storm builds like I mentioned and wait for the terran to sac a little bit into your unexpected storm transition. At that point you should feel more safe to incorporate some storm drops into your play.

Again, while this may not be the most solid or perfect build, it is a way to freshen up your games and force you to try some fun early game harassment that normally you aren't able to do. So even if you can't follow the build perfectly,at least try out some of the ideas in itand incorporate them into your own builds.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GoOutProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,Probe,GasProbe,Nexus,GasProbe,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,WarpgateUpgrade,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Stalker,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Observer,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Observer,RoboticsBay,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,WarpInStalker,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,GraviticDrive,WarpInSentry,Pylon,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInSentry,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpPrism,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,TwilightCouncil,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Forge,Probe,Probe,Nexus,Pylon,Pylon,Immortal,TemplarArchives,GroundArmorLevel1,Charge,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,PsionicStorm,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,WarpInHighTemplar,WarpInHighTemplar,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,WarpInHighTemplar,WarpInHighTemplar,PhotonCanon,PhotonCanon,PhotonCanon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:35:31 PM;

The cool thing about this build as well since it's less all in, is that if it gets scouted you can easily transition out of it and harass with an immortal drop or a sentry drop in the main and FF the ramp. This is because of the fact that you actually get the natural gasses.

Just a few things you have to remember about this build is that you have to be aware of speedling all ins. This is because your natural wall off is going to be a bit later than most builds, so you want to be sure that nothing is hitting you before you can get it down. If needed you can wall off quicker if you see something coming.

Also make sure you hide your robo fairly well. If a zerg sees that fast of a robo they're going to expect something so it's best to hide it as much as possible.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'HuK 5gate Warp Prism Attack', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with 2 Stalkers and a Mothership Core to take map control, and then follows up with a Warp Prism and 5 Gateways to drop the main of your opponent and force field him out of his own base.

Benchmark: When your Warp Prism finishes (@7:05ish), you should have around 32 Probes, 2 Stalkers, 4 Sentries, 1 Warp Prism, and a Mothership Core.

Scouting

This build is most effective against gasless openers from Terran, and quite ineffective against 1 base plays. Thus, be sure that you confirm your opponent doing a Reaper FE, CC First, or 1rax FE build with either your Probe scout at 13 supply or with your initial Stalker poke. If your opponent has not opened with an expansion, then abandon the Warp Prism and go instead for 2 more Assimilators, a Robotics Bay, double Forge, and standard macro PvT play. If your opponent has opened with an expansion, then proceed with this build and be sure to force field your opponent out of his main base.

Transitions

This build is a strong, 5 gate attack off of 2 bases with only 2 Assimilators.  Thus, you have to damage with this attack if you want to go into the midgame with an advantage. Assuming you do no damage and you lose the Warp Prism, you will have a very hard time coming back in the game, and should play stupidly greedy if you want a chance to come back. If you do some damage with this build but eventually lose everything, then you might still be in the game; transition by getting both Assimilators at your natural and go into a standard Colossi/Forge midgame. If you do a lot of damage and save some of your army with the Warp Prism, then you can feel free to take a greedy third base instantly while transitioning directly into Colossi+upgrades off of double Forge.

Tips

- Use your initial Stalkers and Mothership Core for map control and early game scouting. Only build the Warp Prism if you are playing against an expanding Terran. Get your natural?s Assimilators and go into Colossi if you see your opponent staying on one base.
- Against Reaper play, keep at least one Stalker at home in order to defend your Probes and/or stop him from seeing your Warp Prism.
- When you finish your Warp Prism, load up your 4 Sentries instantly and head directly for your opponent?s main base.
- Poke your opponent?s front with your Stalkers before you go into the main with your Warp Prism to make sure that your opponent has all his units at his natural.
- Drop your Sentries on the high ground near your opponent?s ramp to instantly force field him out.
- Transform your Warp Prism into Phasing Mode and constantly warp-in 5 units at a time, favoring Zealots and Sentries.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with your Stalkers/Mothership Core to easily defend Reapers as well as take map control. Then, with the scouting intel that your Probe and Stalker poke give you, you follow up with a very early Warp Prism and 5 gate attack in order to drop in your opponent?s main while you force field him out. Against a non-expand build, you have the Robotics Facility and can get Observers or Immortals to play safe.

However, opening with this build delays your midgame tech by a lot. By only staying on 2 Assimilators, you do not have the gas income to go into Colossi instantly, and thus have to rely on your Warp Prism doing damage to get a leg up on your opponent. Also, this build relies a lot on early game scouting in order to ensure that your opponent is going for a standard expansion into Bio play.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,MothershipCore,Stalker,Chronoboost,Probe,Nexus,Probe,RoboticsFacility,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Chronoboost,WarpPrism,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpInSentry,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInSentry,WarpInSentry,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:35:31 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'HyuN 12 Roach Opener', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This 12 Roach Rush is a timing attack designed to cripple a Terran economy, transitioning into a further all-in or macro play as needed.

Scouting

There is only minor scouting necessary with this build before you hit your opponent with your 12 Roaches. Simply ensure that your opponent is not cheesing you with an 8-8-8 opener or proxy 11/11 Rax.
Once you are committed in the attack, be on the look-out for signs that your opponent is going for a full-on macro play (3 Command Centers), some sort of Hellbat aggression (Armory), some sort of Banshee play (Techlabbed Starport), or normal Bio play (multiple Barracks). Your upcoming transition requires you to both do some damage and later handle any counter attack potential from your opponent without losing much yourself.

Transitions

Depending on what you are most comfortable with and what you scout your opponent doing, you can transition into a later all-in or macro play yourself. Note that regardless of whichever path you follow, you will have to do some amount of damage with your attack or you will be behind both in terms of economy and tech.
If you are transitioning into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk play, stop all Roach production, and get a Lair, Metabolic Boost, and 2 Evolution Chambers as soon as possible. Getting Mutalisks out to defend 3 bases from drops as you tech towards +2/+2 Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk with all the necessary upgrades is how you?ll get ahead in the midgame.
If you are transitioning into a Roach based midgame, try to avoid making many more Roaches after your initial 12 roach opener. Instead, focus on securing 3 Hatcheries, 2 Evolution Chambers, and teching for a Speed Roach/Speed Hydra midgame (with potentially Swarm Host/Viper lategame).
If you are transitioning into another all-in, your best best is some sort of Roach based army with splash damage (such as a Roach/Bane all-in). Do note that any follow-up all-in will be particularly weak against Banshee or Widow Mine defenses.

Tips

- As you get to your first 100 Gas, if there is still a scout in your main base, consider fake researching Metabolic Boost. Be sure to cancel if before you get to 28 supply and need to start your Roach Warren.
- Don?t over-commit to making Roaches. Only make 12 and then be sure you are getting the necessary 2 base economy, Overlord count, and creep spread back at home while your attack is commencing.
- The point of the attack is to cripple your opponent, but if the attack does not go too well, there is no retreat; your follow-up depends largely on your ability to scout what your opponent has opened with and react/defend accordingly.

Pros and Cons

This aggressive build can outright defeat opponents that are macroing too hard or do not scout and react adequately. Opening with 12 Roaches gives your early game a muscle that not many other ZvT builds give you, giving you great denial of any Reaper/Hellion openers as well.
However, this build does put you behind both in terms of economy and tech if your attack does not do damage.

This build opens with 5 Stalkers to apply pressure to your opponent and scout for what they?re opening.  It then follows up with a Stargate Expand, allowing you to reactively counter your opponent?s opening tech.

Benchmark: When you Stargate finishes (@6:30ish), you should have 24 Probes, 5 Stalkers, and a Mothership Core.

Scouting

Because of how low on minerals you are, you cannot afford to Probe scout.Thus, all of your scouting comes from your Stalkers.

Being active with your initial 3 Stalkers around your natural, third, and watchtower will prevent your opponent from sneaking proxy Pylons past you and hitting you with a very fast Gateway unit attack. Also, with your mobile army, you can head directly at your opponent in order to scout what units they have made and even attack them if they are attempting to expand quickly.  Your 5 Stalkers (with high ground vision from your Mothership Core) must scout what your opponent is doing, so that you can react accordingly with your Stargate in the midgame.

- If your opponent is fast expanding, then produce an Oracle from your Stargate and attempt to pressure the front with your Stalkers as your Oracle does damage in the main.
- If your opponent has multiple Sentries out, then attempt to bust up the ramp with your Stalkers to force him to use Force Fields to defend his ramp. The most likely scenario is that your opponent is making a Robotics Facility behind their Sentry count. However, it is also possible that your opponent is making a Stargate instead.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then make an Oracle or two and keep them in their base by threatening to kill multiple workers if they leave.
- If your opponent has a Stargate of their own, make constant Phoenix and position your units very defensively to deal with early Oracles.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then make one Oracle to stay defensive with in case of DTs. Afterwards, you can make up to 3-4 Phoenix for map control and harass potential, but quickly transition into Void Ray/Immortal to stay safe against Blink play.

Transitions

This build transitions into a macro game very easily. However, the actual unit composition of that macro game very often depends completely on what build your opponent has chosen to open with. If your opponent stays on one base for too long, then throw down more Gateways, constantly make units, and prepare to defend your natural with Void Rays, Stalkers, (possibly Immortals), and your Planetary Nexus. In Stargate vs Stargate macro games, quickly go up to 2 Stargates constantly making Phoenix and get a Fleet Beacon for the Phoenix Range upgrade. In Stargate vs Robotics macro games, use your Phoenix or Oracles to get an economic advantage, while transitioning into Sky-toss or a Phoenix/Blink all-in. In Stargate vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponent?s potential Blink or Dark Templar harass, as you transition to Void Ray/Immortal for defense or pure Sky-toss.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very safe build that gets quick map control with 5 Stalkers early on for safety, aggression, and scouting. With accurate scouting information, it then transitions into Stargate play and expands so that you can play a reactive macro game with a strong economy.

When you are out on the map with your first Stalkers, however, your opponent might sneak an Oracle into your main base. Be careful that you are only aggressive when you can be aggressive and only use your Stalkers for scouting when you cannot be aggressive.

Then it follows up with a quick 3rd Command Center to get a leg up against a macro-oriented Protoss opponent.

Scouting

This macro build is a greedy build, so scouting for all-ins is important.  However, you cannot afford to (nor have any need to) scout with an SCV before 17 supply. When you get to your opponents base, check whether they have a natural expansion started at or before the 5 minute mark. If your opponent has not started a Nexus by around the 5 minute mark, and they have both gas geysers, then you can assume they are performing an all-in with either a Twilight Council or Stargate. Be prepared to delay your 3rd Command Center in favor of 2 more Bunkers at the front (or main if your opponent appears to be doing a Blink all-in) and/or a Turret per mineral line to deal with Oracles.

All of the midgame scouting will come from you pushing out and taking the middle watchtowers, attacking the front, and dropping the main once you have Medivacs out. Simply noticing what units and unit composition your opponent is using to defend should give you enough information about their midgame plans to make informed counters.

Transitions

Because of how much infrastructure and time has been spent on Bio play in this build, the only possible follow up is going for more Bio play and adding in Vikings+Ghosts (and Hellbats or Widow Mines for the late game) as you take more bases.

To transition into standard Bio play, get another Engineering Bay and an Armory to continue double upgrades, add-on a Reactor and Tech lab onto your 4th/5th Barracks, get all of your third bases Refineries, and throw down either a Ghost Academy or a 2nd Starport depending on whether your opponent is going for Colossi or High Templar.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong build because of the powerful economy you kick start with your initial CC First and quick third. Also, by avoiding early Widow Mine drops or harassing units and focusing completely on getting upgrades and Bio, your army is considerably stronger at the 10 minute mark than most other TvP builds. Finally, this build is strong because you get a fast Engineering Bay and excess minerals, and thus have the opportunity to throw down Bunkers/Turrets to deal with any sort of 1 base aggression that a Protoss player can throw at you.

However, this build is only safe if your scouting is effective. Misjudging that your opponent is going for a macro game instead of an all-in can cost you the game instantly. Also, there is no opportunity with this build to apply pressure before you finish Stim and Medivacs at the 10 minute mark because it is focused on economy instead of pressure.

Tips

- The main strength of this build is the economic advantage. Do NOT miss SCVs as you are taking bases and macroing up.
- You cannot afford to scout before 17 supply in order to afford the CC and Barracks on time, but scouting what your opponent is doing in the early game is crucial, so be sure to send an SCV to scout soon after you reach 17 supply.
- Build another Bunker or two at the front if a scan or your SCV scout finds that your opponent has not started an expansion around the 5 minute mark.
- If you are playing completely blind, build a Missile Turret in each mineral line to defend against the possibility of Oracles before they could possibly arrive.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'INnoVation 2 Base SCV Pull', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

Designed specifically to kill most Protoss players during the mid game Templar transition, INnoVations SCV pull hits at around 14 minutes with MMM, Vikings, SCVs, and 2/1 upgrades.

Scouting

The first ten minutes of the game is a standard TvP Reaper FE, so scouting and reactions proceed as normal.

First, SCV scout, 15 supply at the latest, to see if you are being 10 gate Zealot rushed. Then follow up with your Reaper scout, checking pylon count, assimilator count, gas mined, and MSC/Stalker/Nexus timing.

Your early Engineering Bay allows for equally early Missile Turrets, so you should be able to build a turret in your main base and position marines in your natural mineral line in the event of an Oracle attack.

Against a delayed Protoss expansion (4:10+, no Nexus), always build a bunker.

Against a fast expanding Protoss, poke with your first Marauder and 8-10 Marines to force overcharge and to gauge his army size.

This initial poke will reveal the following possibilities:

- Little to no Gateway units: Possible double forge (proceed as normal) or Dark Templars (build turrets and bank one scan minimum).
- No obvious Observers: Confirm Twilight tech. If your opponent is going for Templar instead of Colossus, immediately abandon the build and do a biomine parade style using a reactored Factory and five barracks before your third Command Center. SCV pulls are a poor choice against Pisonic Storm.
- More Stalkers then usual: Possible Blink Stalker aggression. React accordingly with bunkers and mines. Consider hiding your small poke squad at his third or fourth, and counter attacking when he moves all his stalkers and his MSC to your side of the map.
- Phoenixes: Phoenix Colossus is by far the most likely choice, but constantly scout to see if the Colossus count is rising. If it remains at one or two for very long, be cognizant of the possibility of a feint into Templars.
- Healthy Gateway unit count: Proceed as normal.

These above are only a few examples, but the most common. Against most styles that involve Colossus (single forge, double forge, blink colossus, phoenix colossus, etc) you will be able to simply play as normal and execute the all in without any problems.

For lower level players, please be advised all scouting reactions as written above are general assumptions made against players attempting optimal strategies. You will be blindsided by sub optimal and often illogical strategies quite often, but you should be able to compensate with superior macro and mechanics.

Transitions

As with any all-in, there is no transition unless you have done a significant amount of damage.

If your attack fails, there is no transition; you will die almost immediately to any counter attack, or you will be contained to two bases and slowly starve to death.

If your attack succeeds in mostly destroying Protosss army, but you cannot finish off your opponent, retreat and rally defensively. Continue your upgrades, maintain consistent worker production, and add a third command center and a Ghost Academy, if necessary.

Tips

The main objective of this push is to successfully engage and destroy his army decisively. Your SCVS are there to absorb just enough Colossus volleys to allow your Vikings to destroy all the AOE and your MMM to shoot through the Gateway buffer.

Again, to emphasize, your objective is to destroy his army decisively, not to destroy his third, or his natural, or snipe any tech. You are to take one crushing victory with your army before beginning to do any eco or tech damage.

During the actual engagement, be sure to have your SCVs in front of your main army. Attack in as wide of a concave as you can form, and make sure that your Vikings are shift A-clicked across his Colossus.

Do not attempt any drops or secondary attacks. Your attack needs to be as strong as possible along a single front for the highest chance of success.

Pros and Cons

The first ten minutes of this build, as mentioned above, are identical to a standard Reaper FE, making this a particularly tricky all in to scout. Additionally, this build has the benefit of blind countering some two base Colossus all-ins because it gets Vikings so quickly, and in such high numbers.

That being said, just as with any all-in, if scouted and identified, this build loses a lot of its potency. A faster than normal Templar transition and increased Sentries for force fields are both popular and effective responses against scouted SCV pulls.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,EngineeringBay,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,SCV,Barracks,SCV,DoubleMarines,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SCV,CallMule,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,TechLabOnBarracks,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,StimPack,Marauder,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,Factory,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marauder,CallMule,SCV,SCV,InfantryArmorLevel1,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Starport,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnFactory,DoubleMarines,Marauder,SCV,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SupplyDepot,Refinery,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,CombatShield,SupplyDepot,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMarines,CallMule,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,Armory,CallMule,Barracks,Barracks,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,ConcussiveShells,SCV,SCV,CallMule,TechLabOnBarracks,ReactorOnBarracks,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,InfantryWeaponsLevel2,SupplyDepot,CallMule,Marauder,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleVikings,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,Marauder,Starport,CallMule,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleVikings,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,CallMule,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Viking,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleVikings,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,CallMule,Marauder,Marauder,Viking,DoubleVikings', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:35:32 PM;

This macro build order opens with a quick 3 Hatchery opening to get a strong economy and then transitions into a Tech-heavy army in order to stay safe against early attacks and lay on the aggression to Protoss before the late game starts. This build maxes out on Roach/Hydra/Viper in order to crush your opponent?s army or deny their 3rd/4th base.

Scouting

Scout with either Overlords, Zerglings, Overseer, or Changelings when your Hydralisk Den goes down. Send them into either the main base or the 3rd base in order to see if Protoss is going for a tech-heavy composition (Colossus/Void Ray/etc) or a Chargelot-heavy composition. If they are going for a Chargelot heavy composition, instantly throw down a Banelings Nest, start Baneling Speed, and max out with around 16 Banelings in your unit composition.
Besides this, all mid and late game scouting comes from the Roach/Hydra/Viper pokes or attacks that you will perform. React appropriately by either re-maxing with Ultras or Swarm Hosts. You will need a 5th base to fully support any Hive-tech re-maxes.

Transitions

There is no ?transition? per se. If you can win the game with this push, then be sure to attack in an open position, use Blinding Cloud or Abduct appropriately, and take the game quickly. If you cannot win the game outright, then fall back on your 4/5 base economy and tech switch to whatever best counters your opponent?s army. Note that you should get a lot of static defense in order to stay safe during your super late game tech switches between Mutalisks, Swarm Hosts, and Ultralisks.

Tips

- If your first Overlord scouts your opponent going for a Gateway expand, then you should abandon getting the third base, instead getting an Extractor and starting Metabolic Boost before taking your 3rd.
- If your natural gets Pylon blocked, then you can make an early Overlord at 15 supply instead of the Hatchery in order to buy some time against it. If your opponent lets the Pylon finish, then simply making 4-6 Zerglings to take the Pylon down should be enough of a commitment before returning back to the build.
- Being thorough about checking for early proxy Pylons across the map with your early game Zerglings is crucial against early Protoss timings. Being able to spot aggression and stop it before it can even begin is the easiest way to avoid quick losses.
- Be sure you send in an Overlord scout at 7:00. Spotting your opponent?s midgame tech informs your next step with this build(whether it be more Drones, a Hydralisk Den, or Spore Crawlers).
- Vipers will be usable (Consume finishes) 3:30 after your Infestation Pit starts.
- Scouting for a heavy Chargelot composition before you max can be quite important. Throwing down a Banelings Nest and maxing with several Banelings can be the difference between a quick loss and a sure win.
- Once you have re-maxed on Ultras, starting a Spire and tech-switching between Mutalisks and Swarm Hosts/Ultras is a strong way to win in the very late game. Also note that you should get a lot of static defense when performing these late game tech switches.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a hugely economic opening while still being safe. It then transitions into a Viper-based defense in order to secure your 4th base and quickly max out on Roach/Hydra/Viper.
This build however requires constant scouting in order to be safe. Also, it is not great against Skytoss unless you scout it early because you might over-produce Roaches (which obviously cannot shoot up) when gearing up for a normal attack.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Queen,Zergling,Drone,Drone,Queen,Hatchery,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Queen,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Overlord,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,RoachWarren,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Overlord,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,EvolutionChamber,Extractor,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Lair,Overlord,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Hatchery,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,MissleAttacksLevel1,MetabolicBoost,Extractor,Extractor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Overlord,InfestationPit,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Queen,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Hatchery,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Hive,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GlialReconstitution,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,HydraliskDen,MissleAttacksLevel2,Extractor,Extractor,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,MuscularAugments,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Viper,Viper,Viper,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,BanelingNest,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 2:35:32 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'INnoVation Reaper-Hellion 3CC', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

Invented by Flash but refined and popularized by INnoVation, this Reaper/Hellion 3CC variant is by far the most popular on ladder and is considered by the majority of Terran players to be the most standard of macro builds. Its versatility has stood the test of time, and the current version below will be continually updated as INnoVation continues to optimize it again and again.

Scouting

You can open with this build regardless of what your opponent is doing, so SCV scouting is unnecessary. You only need to SCV scout if you want to confirm that your opponent is opening Hatchery First and want to start a Bunker at their natural in order to begin Reaper/Bunker pressure.

The rest of your scouting will come from your Reapers and then later Reaper+Hellions poking the front and forcing your opponent to reveal what units they have in order to defend your attacks. Note: Ling Speed will finish around 3 minutes after your opponent takes an Extractor. Thus, if your initial SCV/Reapers see your opponent taking gas, be sure to send your Reapers back just before those 3 minutes are up and wait for some Hellions before attempting to engage Speedlings in the open field.

In case your Reapers or Hellions spot your opponent making Roaches or going for a Roach Warren, immediately cancel your next pair of Hellions and begin making Widow Mines and Marauders. Having your Widow Mines positioned effectively, and using SCVs to tank damage or repair your Bunker will be all you need to stay alive.

Be prepared to throw the timings of the second half of this build out assuming any serious aggression, such as a Roach Bane all-in.

Transitions

This build transitions well into both Marine/Tank or Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine because it sets up the basic infrastructure needed for either of those and gets Stimpack.

The above transition involving double barracks after hellions followed by double ebay is the standard transition. In the event of an extreme all in, such as Roach bane, immediately begin marauder, mine, and bunker production. Against a strong Roach timing it is advised to begin tank production while slightly delaying either your Starport or Engineering Bays; this is most demonstrated notably in INnoVations series against Hyun in the WCS 2014 Global Finals.

Another great transition if you have done some damage with your Reapers or Hellions is going for a Hellbat/Marauder follow-up attack. How Dragon does this is throw down an Armory as soon as you start your 3rd Command Center, and then make Hellbats constantly as soon as the Armory finishes.  Starting two Engineering Bays and going for a +1/+1 Marauder/Hellbat push is a great way to keep up the aggression against your Zerg opponent. Keep in mind that this sort of 3CC Hellbat aggression is far weaker than a two base committed Hellbat push.

Pros and Cons

This build was originally intended as an aggressive opener backed by strong macro. In modern TvZ, however, any competent Zerg player will easily deflect Reaper Hellion pressure with minimal losses, and gasless three hatches are becoming increasingly rare due to the benefits provided by opening either Speedlings or Roach aggression. As such, the major pro of this build should now be listed as the amount of information that the Reaper can provide; because Zerg cannot proxy any tech, you should be aware of what Zerg is doing most of the time. In this way, opening Reaper/Hellion is inordinately safer than simply opening Hellions, if only because of the information difference.

The weakness of this build traditionally had been hyper aggressive openers, such as fast Speedling rushes (which can be deterred by bunkers between your 2nd CC and your main ramp), Roach/Bane busts (which can be held with bunkers, repair, and either mines or hellions with Marauders), or even fast Muta play (which INnoVation countered by simply pushing at his normal time with three missile turrets at home).

The new biggest threat against this build, however, is Roach timings. Simply put, this build focuses very heavily on Hellion production, and delays all other AOE quite significantly (usually up until around 11+ minutes). As such, 1-1 Roach Busts, or fast 2-2 Roach Hydra max out attacks, or even Roach Hydra into Brood Lords are all excellent examples of builds in which players should quickly identify, cut Hellions, and immediately begin adapting their builds for the situation.

Learning this Build and the Difficulty Curve

This build is undoubtedly one of the hardest macro builds to learn in the game. Besides its extreme adherence to timings and linear sequences, it is also extremely punishing in every aspect; INnoVation has refined this build to the point of impracticability; over queueing means delaying Hellions; delaying Hellions delays your Barracks, delaying your Barracks delays your starport, and delaying your starport delays your entire 1-1 push. In short, a single mistake has many more long lasting impacts as opposed to a standard Terran build.

To go about learning this build, it is important to work on only one section at a time and to not try to do everything at once when you first start off, else you will immediately fail.

In the order of things to focus on (#1 being top priority, and #8 being the lowest priority)

1. Worker Production
2. Not getting supply blocked, not over queueing, and proper rallies for all structures
3. The build itself (for example, starting Hellions before 5:30, or double E-bay and 2nd gas geyser at 7:40) and its relevant timings
4. Taking your Third base on time
5. Scouting
6. Keeping your Reaper Hellion alive
7. Harassing
8. Micro (Sniping the first creep tumor, catching the transfer of drones to the third base, weakening Queens to force transfuses and decrease tumors, sniping active tumors, runbys, etc.)

In short, always defer to the priorities, and only move down the line as you can accomplish the others. Even if you kill 32 Zerglings with your Hellions, it is irrelevant if you Medivacs finish at 12 minutes instead of 10:20. Even if you land your third base at 8:30, it is irrelevant if you only have 26 SCVs at the time instead of 40-50 that INnoVation might have. And even if you plant every structure down perfectly at the allotted times, supply blocks, over queueing, poor rallies, and suboptimal worker distribution also grind this entire build to a screeching halt.

Focus on one step at a time, and continually re watch INnoVations replays of this build from his view to fully internalize the mechanics and decisions that make this build brilliant.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,Reaper,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,CommandCenter,GasScv,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Factory,SCV,SCV,CallMule,CommandCenter,SCV,LiftRaxFromReactor,OrbitalCommand,LandFactoryOnReactor,Marine,SCV,DoubleHellions,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleHellions,StimPack,Marine,SCV,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,DoubleHellions,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnFactory,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,EngineeringBay,EngineeringBay,Refinery,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Marine,SCV,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,InfantryArmorLevel1,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,SCV,SCV,SCV,LandRaxOnReactor,LandRaxOnReactor,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Refinery,Refinery,ReactorOnFactory,Starport,SCV,SCV,SCV,CallMule,CallMule,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,ConcussiveShells,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,Armory,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Refinery', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:16:56 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'INnoVation Reactor Hellion 3CC', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This CC First build gets a ridiculously fast 3rd Command Center, taking your economy immediately into the midgame. Using Reactor Hellions for map control and scouting information, this build is also reasonably safe; your Hellions let you quickly react to any Zerg all-in and Widow Mines + 3 Orbitals provides a reasonable defense.

Scouting

Instead of worrying about early game Zerglings, Innovation just builds his Command Center on the high ground, and finishes a wall-off with the initial Barracks. Thus, Innovation does not scout at all until his first Hellions pop.  With these Reactor Hellions he takes map control, clears out any Zerglings at watchtowers, and pokes Zergs front to spot the Zergs third base, any buildings at the front, and any units that Zerg is making.

- If you see a ton of Speedlings, then make sure your Hellion micro is on point. Feel free to pull back behind your natural wall in order to more effectively deal with Speedlings.
- If you see Roaches, then immediately cut Reactor Hellion production and start making Widow Mines two at a time. Make a Marauder, and consider cutting SCVs in order to complete a wall-off at your natural and prevent your opponent from running past your Bunker/Widow Mines.
- If you see two Evolution Chambers, then assume your opponent is playing a macro game.
- Alternatively, if you see a third base, then you can also assume your opponent is playing a macro game.

After any early pressure is spotted or not spotted, lift off your third Command Center and take your third. Use your Hellions and Marines (now with Stim) to secure it. All mid-game scouting will come from your incoming push with your first Medivacs.

Transitions

This build transitions well into both Marine/Tank or Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine because it sets up the basic infrastructure needed for either of those and gets Stim, +1/+1, and Combat Shields. Its infeasible to transition into Mech because of how much infrastructure and time you have already committed to into Bio upgrades.

For either transition, secure your third base, take both Refineries at your third, start +2/+2, and produce a lot of Marines. When transitioning into Marine/Tank, start a Tech lab on your Factory as well as a second Factory to kick start your Siege Tank count. When transitioning into Bio/Widow Mine, produce a Reactor on your Factory and start cranking out Widow Mines as you abuse your mobile Marine/Medivac force to apply pressure to your opponent. A +2/+2 timing attack with several Siege Tanks or several Widow Mines, and a lot of Marines is a very strong timing to hit.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a ridiculously economic opener  CC First into 3 CC.  However, this build gets Reactored Hellions quite quickly in order to take map control as well as stay safe against early Speedling timings. Also, your Hellions are quite useful in terms of the scouting information they give you.

However, this build is somewhat weak to early Roaches. Also, you can only apply very light pressure to your opponent with your initial 6 Hellions  all other harass will have to come later once Medivacs are out.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Bunker,Marine,CallMule,SCV,Factory,CallMule,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,SCV,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,SCV,StimPack,Marine,CallMule,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SCV,EngineeringBay,EngineeringBay,DoubleHellions,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,SCV,SCV,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,InfantryArmorLevel1,Marine,LiftFactoryFromReactor,ReactorOnFactory,Barracks,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SupplyDepot,CallMule,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,LandRaxOnReactor,DoubleMarines,SCV,LandRaxOnReactor,DoubleMarines,Marine,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Armory,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marine,CombatShield,CallMule,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SCV,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marine,ReactorOnFactory,ReactorOnBarracks,TechLabOnBarracks,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SCV', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:16:56 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Jaedong 9 Pool', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a 9 Pool in order to apply a lot of early pressure to your opponent and keep them on one base, and then transitions into more macro oriented play with a Speedling follow-up.

Scouting

All of your scouting comes from your initial Overlords and your 10 Zerglings.  First scout where your opponent has spawned by sending your Overlord directly to one of the possible bases. Then use your first 6 Zerglings (with more rallied) to poke/prod your opponent?s base.
If you see your opponent?s natural Hatchery nearly done, then they have performed a Hatchery First opener and you can choose either to ignore the natural and attack their workers in the main or to focus exclusively on the natural and plan to bring it down. Note that you MUST do economic damage one way or another with your 10 Zerglings or you will fall behind economically.
If your opponent?s natural Hatchery is only just started, then they have performed a Pool First opener. Focus on canceling the natural Hatchery ? you won?t be able to do much damage in the main before their Spawning Pool finishes.
If your opponent does not have a natural, then go up into the main and check their gas count. Prepare against 1 base play of either Banelings or Roaches by focusing much more on Speedlings and potentially getting a Spine Crawler.

Transitions

You can use this opener to transition into any form of Zerg play. If you want to end the game immediately, you can put Drones back on gas and go for a 1 base Ling/Bane all-in.
More standard play ensues by starting your natural expansion as soon as possible and making only as many Speedlings as needed to be safe and have map control. For a Roach midgame, start a Roach Warren and Lair after your first 100 gas. Then, on 3 gasses, you can start Roach Speed and +1 Attack. For a Mutalisk midgame, get a Lair with your first 100 gas and saturate your 2 bases and 4 gasses as soon as possible. Start your Spire as soon as your Lair finishes.

Tips

- Attack his Drones in his main if he has performed a Hatchery First opener
- Attack his natural expansion if he has gone for a Pool First opener
- Scout his main if he has gone for a 1 base build
- Do NOT make too many Zerglings. It may seem tempting to try and kill your opponent with constant reinforcements, but slow Zerglings lose their effectiveness very quickly. Drones are much more important.
- Be sure to pull off of gas once you have mined 100 for Metabolic Boost. You need all of your Drones mining minerals in order to boost your economy into the midgame.

Pros and Cons

This build opens up with a 9 Pool in order to situate aggressively in a matchup known for its early game volatility. It also gets Metabolic Boost at a standard time, while still allowing for both macro or all-in transitions.
However, this build is obviously a lot less economical than most other ZvZ builds, so you must do some sort of economic damage with your initial 10 Zerglings or risk falling behind.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,CancelExtractor,Drone,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Queen,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,MetabolicBoost,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Overlord,InjectLarva', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:16:56 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Leenock 3 Base Ultra', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with fast upgrades and mass Speedlings to crush any midgame attacks. It then transitions into a strong 3 base Ultralisk timing to either cripple the Protoss opponent or outright win the game.

Scouting

Scout first with your 2 initial Zerglings, use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of the Protoss base depending on the map.   Check to see whether your opponent is Gateway expanding or Forge expanding. Be wary of early pressure if your opponent is Gateway expanding.
With your 7:00 overlord scout, consider adding a Baneling Nest if you are up against a Gateway timing. Make mass Speedlings to defend any 2 base ground plays or ramp up Queen production early to defend any 2 base air plays.
Against a 2 base Colossus push, consider adding a Spire for Corruptors if you need more defense. Also, regardless of whether or not you need to make Corruptors for defense, you should start Air upgrades in case of a Mutalisk switch after you have maxed out with your Ultralisk army.
Ideally, your Ultras should be out with +5/+3 around 15:50. Commit to an attack as soon as possible when these upgrades finish.  If you have yet to take a 4th base and Spire or Hydralisk Den by this stage in the game, get them now.

Transitions

There is no ?transition? per se.  If you can win the game with this push, then be sure to attack in an open position and take the game quickly. If you cannot win the game outright, then fall back on your 4 base economy and tech switch to whatever best counters your opponent?s army.

Tips

Against Pylon blocks

- If you want to try and guarantee the Hatchery being placed, send a Drone to your natural around 11/12 supply and hide it there. This might trick Protoss into thinking that you are going Pool first.  Note that this will not work every time, and it also will not stop a Protoss dedicated to Pylon blocking you.
- A 15 Pool/15 Hatch/15 Gas opener (or at worst ? if they fail to cancel the Pylon ? a 15 Pool/15 Gas/and Hatchery as soon as you can) will be fine in this case. The most important thing is starting your Extractor on time, not the natural Hatchery.
- Be sure to make 4-6 Zerglings to take the pylon down if you need to, and go up to 3 Queens as soon as you can ? just like normal.
- Once you place your Extractor, the first 100 gas goes to Metabolic Boost, and place your Evolution Chambers when you get to 175 gas like normal to transition back into the build.

The Engagement

- Bring your Queens to transfuse, and any optional Infestors or Banelings you made to force good engagements.
- Do NOT engage into a Protoss wall. You want to engage in as open an area as you possibly can for your melee army to do maximum damage.
- Do NOT engage without your queens in transfuse range unless you are sure you can take a strong fight. Strong creep spread with all of your Queens helps tremendously.
- Try to avoid Archons with your Zerglings; use the Ultralisks to tank those. Similarly, focus your Zerglings on Stalkers and Immortals; keep your Ultralisks away from those.
- If you use Ultralisks to crush any forcefields, Zerglings can actually deal with Colossi quite easily as they take minimal damage whilst underneath the Colossi.

Pros and Cons

This build is very strong against a ?standard? Protoss army of Gateway units, Colossi and some Stargate or Templar units. Also, this timing attack has the strong potential to end the game.
However, this build is somewhat simple for Protoss to scout and is vulnerable to timing attacks and all-ins when you only have upgraded Speedlings to defend. Also, if your Protoss opponent is positioned in a well defended location, the engage can be quite difficult to perform well.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Extractor,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Zergling,MetabolicBoost,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Queen,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,EvolutionChamber,EvolutionChamber,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,MeleeAttacksLevel1,GroundCarapaceLevel1,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,Lair,Overlord,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Overlord,Queen,InjectLarva,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,Extractor,Extractor,Queen,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Queen,Hatchery,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,MeleeAtacksLevel2,GroundCarapaceLevel2,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,Overlord,InfestationPit,SpawnCreepTumor,Queen,Queen,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Queen,Queen,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Hive,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Queen,Queen,Overlord,Overlord,Extractor,Extractor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Infestor,Infestor,Infestor,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,AdrenalineGlands,UltraliskCavern,MeleeAttacksLevel3,GroundCarapaceLevel3,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Hatchery,ChitinousPlating,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:17:54 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Jim 1 gate FE to Phoenix-Colossus', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a fast expansion in order to get an economic advantage, using an Oracle for harass potential and defense until you can setup a Phoenix/Colossus midgame unit composition.

Benchmark: When your Robotics Facility finishes (@7:00ish), you should have 1 Oracle, 1 Stalker, 1 Sentry, a Mothership Core, and around 37 Probes.

Benchmark: When your 2nd Colossus finishes (@10:00ish), you should have 2 Colossi, 3 Phoenix, 1 Stalker, 3 Zealots, 2 Sentries, and a Mothership Core with over 50 Probes.

Scouting

Feel free to Probe scout after you build your Gateway in order to determine what your opponent is building. The majority of information about what Terran is doing however will come from what your opponent hits you with.  If you spot a Reaper coming into your base, then try and stop it from seeing your building Stargate with your Stalker and Mothership Core (do not worry too much if it is spotted however, for your Stargate is only initially being used for one Oracle). If you do not spot a Reaper, then send your Mothership Core and use its huge sight range to spot what buildings your opponent has inside of his base before returning home.

The majority of your midgame scouting will come from your Oracle. Use it to spot whether your opponent is opening with Bio, going for fast upgrades, fast triple Command Center, or strong 2 base timing. If you see an opening, then the Oracle can be used to harass your opponent?s SCVs, but the true purpose of the Oracle is constant scouting through the midgame. Your opponent?s 3rd base timing is especially useful as a good benchmark for when you should try and take your 3rd base.

Transitions

The build transitions into a Phoenix/Colossus midgame, with a standard Colossus/High Templar/Archon late game. As soon as you spot your opponent taking his 3rd base, secure a third of your own, then start 2 Forges and several more Gateways. Keep producing Phoenix and Colossus until you have around 7 of each (7 is a LOT for a normal game, but the heavily delayed High Templar tech means that you have a stronger army in the midgame), supplementing your army with Zealots when you have extra minerals. Finally, when your +1/+1 is halfway done, be sure to start a Twilight Council for +2/+2, Zealot Charge, and Templar Archives in order to reach your lategame army.

Tips

- In the early game, you are attempting to get your economy up enough to support Phoenix/Colossus on 2 bases.  Be sure to chronoboost your Probes constantly until you need to divert chronoboost to your Robotics Facility/Stargate.
- Against Reaper play, position your initial Stalker and Mothership Core defensively.  Try to deny it scouting your Stargate, but don?t worry if it is scouted?the Stargate is only initially used for one Oracle.
- The main purpose of your initial Oracle is for scouting. While it is true that you can kill several SCVs if your opponent?s Marines are out of position, do NOT sacrifice your Oracle for a few extra kills. The constant threat of harass and ability to scout for the first 10 minutes of the game is a lot more important than an extra SCV kill or two.
- Position your Phoenix defensively outside your main (to absolutely shut down any midgame drops) up until you are ready to take your third.  If/when your Oracle dies, use your flock of Phoenix to take map control and kill several SCVs with any extra APM you have.
- Take your third base and start 2 Forges as soon as you spot your opponent taking his 3rd base.
- Build more Colossus (up to 7) than you normally would (around 4). With the extra air support tanking and killing Vikings, your Colossus count must be quite large in order to take out your opponent?s Bio army.

Pros and Cons

This build gets out an early Oracle for harass potential and constant scouting. It also gets a strong economy and uses a midgame Phoenix/Colossus unit composition to defend drops and bio pushes with ease. This midgame composition is quite robust in terms of defending your third as well as stopping constant Medivac harass.

However, this build is short on Gateway units for the early stages of the game. Thus, any early drops are quite hard to stop unless you are able to scout them beforehand and prepare appropriately. Also, you do not start your Forges until you start your third base, so you will often be behind in upgrades against a macro-Terran.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,MothershipCore,Nexus,GasProbe,GasProbe,WarpgateUpgrade,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,Probe,Stargate,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Probe,Oracle,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Observer,RoboticsBay,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Observer,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,ExtendedThermalLance,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Phoenix,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Phoenix,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Phoenix,Chronoboost', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:17:54 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Jaedong Roach Drop Nydus All-In', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This all-in hits your opponent?s main with a lot of speed Roaches. However, Jaedong puts his own clever flair on this traditional ZvT All-in by using an Overlord Roach Drop to guarantee his Nydus follow-up is successful.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of very early force, position your Queens to defend your natural and consider getting a Spine Crawler. Banshee play may be an issue with only 2 Queens, but such a fast Lair means you will have a very quick Overseer.
The next scout will be with your initial Roach Warren attack. Terran will be forced to defend his main with all his units, so you?ll see either Bio or Mech units to defend. These Roaches should be able to scout and do some serious economic damage ? hopefully enough to end the game with constant reinforcements from the Nydus Network.

Transitions

This build is a 2 base all-in that gets a lot of attacking units and very few Drones as well as upgrades that do not lend themselves towards the mid or late game. Therefore, there is no well-defined follow-up for the build, should your attack fail. However, if you do a lot of damage with the attack but lose your Nydus Network, be sure to follow-up with a 3rd Hatchery, a lot more Drones, and 2 Evolution Chambers to try to transition into normal play.

Tips

- Against a Reaper/Hellion player, save your Queen energy after you start 2 or 3 Creep Tumors. Having energy for Transfuse lets you push back any early attacks without revealing your Roaches.
- Hide your Roaches for as long as possible before you move out. The less time you give your opponent to react to your build, the better your chance at crushing through their front.
- Make 2 Overlords per inject cycle ? 8 Roaches takes up 16 supply.
- Bring an Overseer or two with your Roach attack so that you have detection against Widow Mines. Remember to split your Roaches to avoid splash damage from either Widow Mines or Siege Tanks.
- This attack is an all-in, so you have to kill your opponent with this attack. Don?t let your Roaches mess around attacking buildings or SCVs ? kill your opponent?s army as soon as possible.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any player going for a fast 3 Command Center build (the current metagame) because of how late their upgrades and army will be. Also, any build that gets both Roach drops AND Nydus Networks is a very fun all-in to play with.
However, this is an all-in, so if you cannot do game-ending damage with the Roach attack, you will be economically behind the Terran opponent.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,MetabolicBoost,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Overlord,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Lair,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,RoachWarren,Drone,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,VentralSacs,Overlord,Overlord,GlialReconstitution,PneumatizedCarapace,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,NydusNetwork,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,NydusWorm', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:17:54 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '1 Rax FE into 2 Medivac Push', @SC2VersionID = '2.0.5', @Description = 'General Overview

This 1rax FE build gives you a strong economy, while staying safe from early Protoss pressure. It then transitions into a strong 10 minute push with +1 attack, Stim, Combat Shields, Concussive shells, and 2 Medivacs.

Scouting

When you send your scouting SCVs, you want to look for gasses, nexus energy, and the units he is producing out of his gateway. If he only has 1 gas before his stalker pops, check to see whether your opponent gets his natural at around 5:15 (You can hide your SCV nearby and then run it in around 5:30) to check for an expansion later if need be. If he has 2 gas and you don?t scout an expansion by 6:00, then be wary of an all-in. The common responses to standard Protoss plays are:
- Nexus First: Bunker rush with 4 Barracks instead of getting your 2nd CC OR Stop making marines at 3, get your 3rd CC and go straight into double upgrades to get a leg up in the macro game.
- Double Gas, No Expansion by 6:00: Get 3 bunkers (and a missile turret if you haven?t ruled out DTs). Pull SCVs to repair and provide a meat shield as necessary.
- 1 Gate Expand: Play normal.

Tips

- To confirm that your opponent is not allining you, have an SCV (or scan) go to his natural just before the 6 minute mark. A 4gate will hit before this timing, but 1 bunker and repair should be able to hold a 4gate easily enough; all other scary allins hit much later and this scout will give you enough time to prepare an appropriate defense.
- Unless you are expecting an allin of some sort, do not make marauders until you?ve started your starport. The 50 gas from making 2 marauders at a time will slow down the push by over a minute.
- Also related to this, you can push your medivac timing earlier by getting your factory before your barracks addons. Because you?re not making marauders just yet anyway, the only difference between getting the addons before factory vs getting them after is that you cut a couple of marines and get a faster medivac timing. Both versions are totally valid.
- Once you have your first marauder out, take your own watchtower by scaring away or killing his stalker ? up until you get a marauder out, you have to stay behind your bunker for defense.
- When you attack with your first 2 medivacs, be sure to scan your opponent?s natural in order to determine how much stuff/how many sentries he has waiting for you. If your opponent has too many units, then double drop the main instead of attacking directly into the natural.  Do NOT engage in chokes against sentries.

Transitions

As you?re pushing out, you will need to place down your 3rd CC, 2nd engibay and armory, 2 more rax, and a ghost academy or 2nd starport to counter your opponent?s HTs or collosi. If you?re feeling safe, then place down the 3rd CC and engibay first. If you?re worried about not having enough units, get the 2 more rax earlier, as well as possibly your ghost academy or 2nd starport before 3rd. Transition into 3 base bio with ghosts/vikings when you have the money.

Pros and Cons

This is probably the most standard 1rax FE. Compared to the other variants, it gives you reasonably timed infrastructure, a very safe opening against most 1 base and early 2 base Protoss all-ins, and of course the exact same economy as the other 1rax FEs.  However, early on you have no map control at all because of how well early stalkers can deal with naked marines in the open field; you don?t get up your 3rd CC extremely fast; and you don?t get up your 5 barracks up as quickly as Bomber?s build.
Other TvP builds, besides the 1rax FE variants, should also be considered. This build gives you a lot smaller army and much later upgrades than MKP?s 2rax early on, in exchange for a much stronger economy and a solid timing attack with Medivacs at around the 10 minute mark. Also, it gives you more scans and SCVs to pull to deal with early DTs and/or pressure. While the 2rax will attack early and hit hard with continued aggression, the 1rax FE will give you a much more powerful attack later on, in exchange for leaving you more vulnerable against the early aggression Protoss can lay on.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,CommandCenter,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,Bunker,Marine,SCV,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Refinery,Refinery,SCV,Marine,CallMule,Marine,Marine,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,Marine,SCV,SCV,Marine,SupplyDepot,StimPack,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Marine,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Factory,EngineeringBay,Refinery,Marine,Marine,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,CombatShield,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Marauder', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:17 PM;

VortiX uses a gasless opening and transitions into a strong Roach Zergling timing, aiming to punish greedier Roach play or swift Mutalisk play.

Scouting

n the early stages of the game, all scouting comes from Overlord vision, so be sure that you send your initial 2 Overlords towards your opponent?s natural expansion. You can use your Overlord to compare his Hatchery?s HP to yours, to determine what kind of opener he used. If his hatchery is stronger than yours, he has gone hatchery first. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is the same HP as yours, he has VERY LIKELY done the same build as you. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is weaker to yours, he has gone for a gas and pool before hatchery in some order, meaning his speed is quicker than yours. Banelings before speed in this scenario is often advised, and likely make the Baneling nest in the main to not lose your Baneling tech to mass Zerglings with speed. An alternative is to not use your Gas, and get extra Queens and 2-3 Spine Crawlers. The main theme here is to not get Speed first, as his WILL be quicker. You need to find an edge that isn?t using Zergling Speed.
When playing versus any very early aggression (<10 pool), use your Drones to defend until you have your own Zerglings, a Queen, and potentially a Spine Crawler. Consider canceling the Hatchery for more minerals. Also use your initial overlord to scout when your opponent is taking their natural Hatchery. Feel free to apply some light pressure with your first Zerglings against a Hatch first build, but do not let it mess up your macro.
Make sure you have 2 to 4 Zerglings out on the map at all times. Send your initial 2 Zerglings to your opponent?s base to spot what they have at the front, and if possible get into the main with 1 Ling to see whether your hatching Drones or Zerglings from their eggs. Use the scouting intel that these pokes give you to determine whether you should get Banelings and extra Zerglings to defend yourself or pressure your opponent, or whether you should continue droning.
If your scout Zerglings see Drones hatching, and no wall at the front, you can choose to make Drones OR Zerglings to pressure. If you scout Zerglings, and no wall at the front, you should make the same amount of Zerglings. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings escape, send them back in to scout in 20~ seconds. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings die, remake the scout. Consider another 2 Zerglings for just-in-case Banelings. If you scout a wall, the Zerg is likely playing passive and you are likely safe.
As soon as you are sure you are safe, transition into your choice of tech.

Transitions

However, because you have not yet committed upgrades to either Ranged or Melee, you can choose between transitioning into Roach Hydra or Ling Ultra.
If you do choose to go for Roaches, immediately research Roach Speed and take your third, while droning as heavily as you can without endangering yourself. You can transition to a similar midgame to that of Vortix?s 3 Base Speed Roach, albeit without the fast upgrades.
It is not recommended you go for a Mutalisk transition.

Tips

Aim to focus down Queens with transfuse energy first, and use Roaches to tank any Baneling hits. Emphasize surrounds with your Speedlings and tank Banelings with your Roaches.

Pros and Cons

This build excels and punishing either greedier Roach players, and players rushing for Mutalisks. If it fails, you are behind as with any timing attack. You do not have any tech, you have no upgrades, and you will almost certainly be behind in drones. Additionally, because you are opening gasless, your defense is likely to be much more difficult. You will have no Banelings or Zergling speed, so your defense will revolve entirely around Spine Crawlers, Queens, and building placement.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Queen,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Drone,RoachWarren,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Extractor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,SpawnCreepTumor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,SpawnCreepTumor,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,SpawnCreepTumor', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:17 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '2 Base Speedling Timing', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build appears to be a standard Zerg opener to the untrained eye, but it actually can outright kill most unrefined Terran macro builds in the lower leagues.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. Do your best to stop your opponent from scouting how many Zerglings you are creating. The rest of your scouting will come from your Speedling timing attack. Check whether your opponent is going for a Bio, Mech, or 3CC play. You should at the least be able to force your opponent to lift off their natural unless they made a tight wall ? don?t commit your Speedlings into a meat grinder if your opponent has walled off successfully.

Transitions

As soon as you hit your attack, you need to be droning quite heavily to be able to stand any sort of chance going into the midgame. Only put Drones back in gas and re-begin teching up to Lair, Evolution Chambers, and Mutalisks once you are getting closer to 2 base Drone saturation.

Tips

- Be sure that you take map control with your initial Zerglings. Being able to deny your opponent vision of your building Zerglings will make this attack that much stronger.
- Do NOT attack into a Terran force behind a full wall-off. Force your opponent to abandon their natural and continue droning up.

Pros and Cons

This build looks like a standard ZvT build, but hits your opponent incredibly aggressively with a lot of early game Speedlings. This Speedling timing should either outright win the game or give you an effective economic advantage that will take you into the midgame. However, because you are cutting Drone production in order to support this swell of Zerglings, your economic situation will be much further behind than what you might be used to. If your opponent holds the attack without taking much damage at all, then it?s possible you will simply get rolled over by any sort of counterattack as you are attempting to make Drones.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Extractor,Drone,SpawningPool,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,StartIdle,StopIdleIn5Seconds,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Queen,MetabolicBoost,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:17 PM;

Force the Zerg to make hydras and spores to counter the five phoenix you make and then counter this forced investment by teching quickly to colossus. The phoenixes then provide the scouting information that you need to react well to the multitude of strategies that Zerg can throw at you. On top of this advantage they are excellent at harassment (killing drones and queens) and at denying map vision.

Hard counters:Greedy Zerg play is the best thing against this build. The phoenix force Zerg into hydras however they do not guarantee the fact that Zerg doesnt take a 4th base and drone as hard as possible. Still this does not mean that the game is over, with good scouting of Zergs eggs you can take your own 3rd earlier than 10:20 and develop your own economy alongside Zergs. In addition to this weakness early swarm host play off 2 base can be extremely hard to deal with due to the investment into phoenix. A throughout probe scout at the start of the game to deduce if gas has been taken and Zergs third base timing will give you the information you need to go robo first or oracle instead of phoenix.

Reactions:Reaction should be made after seeing units pop out of the eggs.

Lings: Take a slightly earlier 3rd (9:30), skipping immortals and making several zealots to protect the probe and constructing nexus.

Roach: Start immortals before colossus. Either 2 immortals or 1 before the first colossus depending on how early Zerg starts producing roach. Here it is also important to not skip the observer because roach burrow may be a possibility.

Hydra: Skip immortals and continue colossus production.

Vipers: Add Templar archives as soon as possible; cut out void rays as soon as the hive is scouted. For this to work well you may need to warp in zealots for the time being instead of stalkers so you can immediately have gas for 3-5 high Templars when the archives finishes.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '2 Rax Reaper FE to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with 2 Barracks to produce a lot of Reapers very quickly.  It is a great way to get complete map control with 4 Reapers, apply heavy pressure to an expanding opponent, and transition into standard Bio play.  This 2rax Reaper build also can instantly win against some Gas First or CC First builds.

Scouting

This build is a reasonably safe build against most things Terran can open with as long as you are smart with your initial four Reapers. Thus, SCV scouting early on is not required or even suggested. Use your Reapers to take map control and pick off Marines/scout the front. However, there may come a time when your opponent has a Bunker up and you can no longer poke the front. Then, while prioritizing keeping your Reapers alive over all else, jump into his base and pick off SCVs/continue to scout.

If you scout your opponent opening Banshee, then cease Reaper productioninstead, favor making Marines and getting an earlier Engineering Bay. If you scout a Widow Mine Drop, then be wary of your opponents Medivac, and hole up in your main base until you have enough units to stabilize. If you scout a Marine/Tank/Banshee all-in, then keep your 2nd Command Center in your main base and play defensive. If you scout a 1rax FE, then scout for the Bio or Mech follow-up, and apply pressure whenever possible.

Note: If you scout your opponent going Mech, then add a 2nd Tech lab instead of Reactor on your initial Barracks and build some marauders too.  You can still follow the same basic build order, but you will have a little less gas than normal, so you might need to get early gas geysers than what is written up above.

Transitions

This build commits too much into Infantry upgrades for you to transition into Mech. However, it transitions quite smoothly into Marine/Tank or pure Bio (vs Mech).

For a Marine/Tank transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory for Siege Tank production, take your third base, start your 4th-6th gas geysers, and start another Engineering Bay+Armory for more upgrades. With your midgame push, confirm what unit composition your opponent is going, and play aggressively/passively accordingly.

For a pure Bio transition (if your opponent is playing Mech), start another Engineering Bay and Armory to continue your upgrades as you take your 3rd Command Center and keep your opponent pinned back. Threaten boosted Medivac drops whenever possible, but do not over commit your army if your opponent has an adequate defense.

Pros and Cons

This build is a safe build that also opens aggressively. With this build, you can pick off Marines and SCV, while simultaneously getting a full scout of your opponents base and stressing their multitasking. This build also has a heavy Marine follow up, and can deal with Banshees or 1/1/1 all-ins rather well due to the Reactor/Tech lab first. This transitions into normal Bio play but gives you the advantage due to early harass and map control.

However, this build performs poorly against early Hellion openings. If you scout Reactored Hellions, cease Reaper production instantly and transition into faster Marine/Marauder production. Also, if your opponent holds the Reapers cost-effectively with a 1rax FE or CC First (either due to you mis-microing, or them having a solid defense), then you will be behind going into the midgame economically.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,Barracks,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Reaper,SCV,SCV,Reaper,Reaper,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Barracks,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,CallMule,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,Marine,CombatShield,SCV,Marine,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Refinery,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,Factory,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,EngineeringBay,StimPack,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SCV,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,CallMule,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marine,CallMule,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,LiftFactoryFromReactor,TechLabOnFactory,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:33 PM;

This mass Reaper build order gets 2 Reactored Barracks cranking out 4 Reapers at a time in order to overwhelm your opponent with purely mass Reaper.

Scouting

There is minimal SCV scouting with this build because you will open the same regardless of what your opponent is making. The majority of your scouting comes from your constant Reaper attacks.

Against anything but Banshees, constantly produce Reapers to overwhelm your opponent. Against Banshees, be sure to cancel your Reaper production and start producing 4 Marines at a time. If you have done significant economic damage, then getting an Engineering Bay for a Missile Turret is not a bad idea either.

Transitions

This build actually transitions pretty well into a decent midgame for being an all-in. However, you can only transition into Bio after opening with this build because it is hard to utilize your quick Reactors and two Barracks early on if you are trying to transition into Mech. When you feel like you cannot do any more damage with your Reapers, be sure to stop Reaper production and begin your Bio upgrades.

For a standard Bio follow-up, get your natural expansion, start Marine production, and get a 3rd Barracks with a Tech lab. This way you can start Stimpack, an Engineering Bay, Factory, and 3rd Refinery all at the same time just like as if you had opened with a normal 1rax FE into Medivacs.

For a fast upgrade transition, start your natural expansion, Marine production from the 2 Barracks, 2 Engineering Bays, and then +1/+1. As soon as you can, get one more Barracks with a Tech lab so that you can start researching Stimpack. Then, you can take your third Refinery and get a Factory to go into Reactored Medivacs and +2/+2.

For a follow-up timing attack, start your natural expansion, Marine production, and a Factory instantly.  Get a Tech lab on the Factory and start Siege Tank production in order to hit a very fast Marine/Tank push with your second Siege Tank. Behind this contain/attack, you can get your 3rd base, 3rd and 4th Refineries, double Engineering Bays, and 2 or 3 more Barracks (get Stimpack and Combat Shields).

Execution

As soon as your first Reapers pop, start being aggressive. Your number one goal is to deny your opponents Factory for as long as possible (Hellions or Widow Mines can be difficult to maneuver around), but in order to do this, you have to be in your opponents face with your Reapers as soon as they are built. Also, with your constant harass, be sure to dwindle your opponents Marine count without committing too hard and losing any Reapers.

Your Reaper count increases very quickly, and when you get around 6 to 8 Reapers, you can truly overwhelm most units your opponent can have.  Thus, focus on killing his army with your initial Reapersyou will be able to kill his SCVs once his army is dead.

In general, if your opponent sees what you are doing, you are in trouble.  Thus, it is suggested that at least one of your Barracks is build outside your base (even just at your natural will sometimes work fine). However, you can proxy both Barracks outside your main to make this build a little more all-in too. This also works for some mind games because if your opponent scouts you with a Refinery but no Barracks in your main, he will most likely try to defend proxy Marauders (a defense that is awful on most maps against mass Reaper).

Pros and Cons

This build is very aggressive and can catch many opponents off-guard.  With a hilarious amount of Reapers, you are usually able to overwhelm their army within the first 8 minutes. However, even if the all-in does fail, it can still transition into a 11-12 minute Bio+Stimpack/Medivac timing.

However, if you do not do much damage, you will be quite behind your opponent in tech (and possibly income). Also, this build can be easily scouted if an SCV sees both Reactors building before a single unit, so at least one of the Barracks must be proxied outside of your main.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Refinery,OrbitalCommand,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,DoubleReapers,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleReapers,SCV,DoubleReapers,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleReapers,DoubleReapers,CallMule,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:33 PM;

Attack your opponent?s main mineral line with 1st Oracle as soon as it finishes (@6:15ish), and push at front with Zealot/Stalker/Mothership Core.

Scouting

This build is an all-in that makes a lot of units, so is safe in general vs an aggressive opponent ? the only scouting you need to do is spot where your opponent has spawned and whether or not they have taken gas. If you are performing this build vs a gasless Terran, you can be much more aggressive with your initial 3 units and oracle. Versus a gassing Terran, you must be wary of Widow Mines, so be sure not to clump up your units when pushing up ramps or going into your opponent?s mineral line with your Oracles.

Transitions

This build is an all-in, so note that there is no clear transition out of it.  Continue making oracles (up to 3 or 4) and warping in Stalkers so that you can break the front. Note that if your opponent does eventually hold and you end up losing your entire army, then you are most likely behind both economically and in tech. Only expand and continue producing Probes once/if you break the front and you are just making sure that you have enough economy to follow up with a win.

Pros and Cons

This build hits very early with a proxied Oracle, taking advantage of the weakness of early game Marines without upgrades. This build is so strong because it gives you enough units to pressure both your opponent?s front and their mineral line simultaneously. It also then gives you the infrastructure needed to warp-in enough Gateway units to eventually bust down your opponent?s front.

However, this build is a very micro intensive build ? you must be target firing with your Oracle in the main, while not losing any of the units in the front, usually for at least 3 minutes. It is also weak vs Widow Mines if you have poor control. Lastly, note that this build is in fact an all-in, so doing some damage but losing your entire army does put you behind by quite a bit.

Tips

- Chronoboost your initial Stalker so that you deny scouting from your opponent as soon as possible.
- Do not get your initial Probe trapped in your opponent?s base or killed, for that will force you to send another Probe to build the proxy Pylon and lose more mining time.
- You have to target fire individual SCVs for the Pulsar Beam to be most effective.
- One Oracle can take down 4 Marines if it has enough energy for Pulsar Beam the entire time.
- You can use the Oracle?s Envision spell for mobile detection in case your opponent has opened Widow Mine or Banshee.
- Be wary of Widow Mines both in the front or in the main mineral line and stay alert of the 40 second cooldown they have between shots.
- Don?t forget to use the Mothership Core?s Time Warp ability to help vs SCVs/marines in the attack at the front.
- Once/if you break the front, be sure to build an expansion and resume Probe production just in case your opponent does eventually hold.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,GoOutProbe,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Probe,Zealot,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Chronoboost,Pylon,Stargate,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Oracle,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Oracle,Chronoboost,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Oracle,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:33 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Alicia 12-12 Colossus All-In', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build utilizes an unconventional Gateway and gas timing to produce a fast Mothership Core for scouting before smoothly transitioning into a 2 Colossus All-in.

Attack your opponent when your 2nd Colossus finishes (@9:30ish) with 2 Colossi, 3 Stalkers, 3 Sentries, and a Mothership Core with about 45 Probes at home.

Scouting

Do not Probe scout with this build. Because you are using a 12/12 opening, you will have an extremely early Mothership Core for immediate scouting. Your Mothership Core should be directly rallied to the enemy base upon completion.

The early Mothership Core allows you to see exactly what a Terran is aiming for. If they are aiming for Factory aggression with a Starport simply chronoboost out 2 Observers, placing one in each base. Position your 3 Stalkers in the main to catch a drop. Bring your Mothership Core home and use it to defend the natural with Photon Overcharge. This defensive setup should allow you to defend any multi-pronged aggression from the Terran.

If it is merely a 2 base, 3 Barracks opener, then proceed as normal.

Transitions

As this is an all-in, the transitions for this build are heavily dependent on the damage you deal. If you kill a significant amount of workers but find yourself unable to finish your opponent off, transition into normal Blink/Colossus play. If you do not kill many workers and lose your army, then you most likely will lose to a follow-up counterattack. If you trade armies but do eventually lose your own, you are free to instantly transition into anything you want?Blink/Colossus, Chargelot/Archon, or Storm play are all equally viable. Remember to start 2 Forges and chronoboost your upgrades to catch up in the upgrade war.

Tips

Produce a third Colossus and leave it at home along with your Mothership Core. This allows you to effectively defend counter aggression with 2 Photon Overcharges. You have enough punch in your frontal push with Forcefield and Guardian Shield not to require Time Warp.

Only chronoboost your 10th and 13th Probe before the completion of your Cybernetics Core. You need to bank energy to allow you to simultaneously chronoboost your Mothership Core and first Stalker. Otherwise your scouting information is delayed and a Reaper can play havoc with your main.

Once you have completed your Mothership Core and initial Stalker, return to chronoboosting Probes until the completion of your Robotics Bay. At this point exclusively chronoboost Colossi. If you find you have spare Nexus energy chronoboost Thermal Lance but prioritize accelerating your Colossus count ? your push begins once both Colossi have been completed.

Pros and Cons

This all-in is one of the most difficult to scout builds currently available to Protoss. To most Terran players it will look like standard macro play and may even prompt incorrect reactions such as earlier Medivac aggression or a fast 3rd Command Center. Also, because of the fast Mothership Core scout, you will almost always be able to identify Terran?s early game build structure (3rax, 1/1/1, etc).

However, because your Mothership Core stays at home for defense and you have no upgrades to fall back on, your attack is fully all-in?there is no way to retreat your Colossus safely if your attack fails and you are certain to fall behind in upgrades as the game stretches on.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Stalker,Chronoboost,WarpgateUpgrade,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Assimilator,Stalker,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,Nexus,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Chronoboost,Stalker,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Observer,RoboticsBay,Assimilator,Assimilator,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,WarpInSentry,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Pylon,Probe,Probe,ExtendedThermalLance,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:34 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '15 Gas Marine-Hellion Expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This fast expansion build created by Innovation uses Hellions to stay safe against Reapers, Banshees, and Hellbatsall while taking map control.

Scouting

Scouting with this build until you get your first Hellions out is not necessary.  However if you want to SCV scout, checking your opponents gas timing clues you in on what they could possibly be doing.

If your SCV sees that your opponent has mined more gas than you have, the most likely are opening with Reapers. However, even if you do not get into your opponents base, you can still tell a Reaper is coming by leaving your scout next to your opponents Barracks to spot whether it dies to a Marine or a Reaper. Your first 2 Marines positioned in your main at a Reaper jump-up spot, followed up by the Reactor for extra Marine production should crush any aggressive Reaper play if you react with and position your initial Marines well. With the Reactored Hellion follow-up you can seize map control and spot if there are any other pushes coming.

When your second Orbital Command finishes and you are still worried about a 1 base play, consider scanning your opponents main base.  Against 1 base play, be sure to have good vision around your base to prevent elevators and to defend your front with a Bunker. Also, a Missile Turret per mineral line with one Viking will shut down any Widow Mine Drops into Cloak Banshee openers. Lastly, if your opponent is going for Hellbat drops, then producing more than 6 Hellions and starting a Viking can be really helpful for your defensenormal Hellions do quite well against Hellbats, and Vikings do quite well at deterring Medivacs.

Execution

If your opponent invested more than 2 Reapers before expanding into bio play, then this is your cue to do heavy damage. If he played greedy and didnt build a bunker at his natural, you can go in with your 4 Hellions, 6 Marines and your first Medivac and kill his un-upgraded Marines. If there is a Bunker at the natural, then simply elevator your Marines and then Hellions into your opponents main and kill as many units as you can.

Against Mech play you might have to play a bit more conservative with your aggression because in Hellion vs Hellion fights, the player who was positioned correctly before the fight usually has the advantage. Instead of committing to an attack or elevator, pulling your army back and placing down a quick 3rd Command Center is a safer way to play.

Against standard Bio play, you can attempt to hit a Marine/Hellion timing at his front with your first 4 Hellions, 6 Marines, and a Medivac. Or, if your opponent is too well defended at the front, perform a 4 Hellion drop and harass his SCVs instead. Getting your 2nd Barracks and starting Stimpack before taking your 3rd Command Center is crucial to staying safe against 10 minute Bio timings and drop play. Alternatively, going Mech and producing Widow Mines/Siege Tanks as you take your third base is a strong way to stay safe as well.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into anything: Marine/Tank or Mech play. Note that as stated in the Execution section above, the follow-up you can do after you get your initial Marine/Hellion/Medivac army is completely dependent on your own preference and the play style of your opponent.

When transitioning into Bio play, against Mech and 3CC builds you can get away with starting your 3rd CC right away and following-up with 2 Barracks with Tech labs (to start Stimpack/Combat Shields), 3 Refineries, and 2 Engineering bays. Against more traditional Bio play it is necessary to start a Tech lab on your initial Barracks for a quicker Stimpack. Then, after taking a 2nd Refinery, you can build a 2nd Barracks onto the naked Reactor and start Siege Tank production to take yourself into the midgame. This is followed up by a 3rd Command Center (between 8:00-8:30), 1 more Barracks, both Refineries at your natural expansion, and 2 Engineering bays. Not having Stimpack completed in time for the inevitable 10ish minute drop play can be a game changer because with the new Medivacs boosting around your main and natural, it is very easy to get caught out of position and take a lot of damage for free.

ForGG does an interesting follow-up where he simply constantly produces Hellions  sometimes going up to 20+ Hellions  and overwhelms his opponents before they have Stimpack or enough Siege Tanks to deal with this attack. Mass Hellions are surprisingly good against opponents who make Hellbats or try drop play without a perfect follow-up.

Another possible follow-up is going for Mech play. This is easily achieved by keeping the Factory onto the Reactor for more Hellions, getting all 4 Refineries while starting more Factories, and starting your 3rd Command Center very quickly. Building some Vikings for drop defense will definitely come in handy as well.

Pros and Cons

This build defends early pressure quite easily, while getting a quick expansion and going into the midgame. Also, once your first Medivac is out, you hit your opponent with lots of pressure early on to kick start an aggressive game. Finally, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for opening with a 1/1/1 grants you the freedom to go into nearly anything.

However, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades. Also, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Factory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,Starport,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SCV,OrbitalCommand,SCV,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,Medivac', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:34 PM;

Chrono on probes up to the 18 supply chrono. Continue chronoing probes when you know youre safe.

From the point it leaves off its up to you to decide what you want to do. You can go into twilight tech for immortal/archon to do a +2 timing or go into passive colossus play.

Like the name suggests, the opening is extremely safe and versatile. Early aggression is completely thwarted with this build as you get an early Sentry and MSCore to defend proxy oracles or gateway pressure. The 4 extra units that you get out of the gateways before expanding really deny any sort of early 3 or 4gate attacks while the MSCore defends vs phoenix and oracle play. The only thing youll need to be careful with is DT openers since the robo is a little bit late compared to other builds. You should be able to get an idea that DTs will be coming though after seeing little to no unit production with your probe scout and maybe even the twilight council if youre diligent enough. In that case you can get the robo before your nexus if you want to be safe, however with 2 forcefields and stalkers to block the ramp you should be able to stall until your observer is out.

Make sure you remember to use your hallucination scout at 6 minutes to know exactly what youre up against. If you see them playing passively you can skip a 3rd gate and get a much faster forge to be ahead on them in upgrades. You also dont need to warp in anything when WG is done if you see them playing passively, it would just be a waste of resources that dont do anything.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '7 Roach Rush', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This classic 7 Roach Rush all-in is a great build for newer players to learn one base macro with. It hits a very quick timing that can crush through inexperienced or unsuspecting opponents.

Scouting

This build can be performed against any opener Terran has. The only scouting you need to do is send your initial 2 Overlords to your opponent?s base in order to spot both where your opponent is spawned and whether or not they have a Bunker or Marauders that you will have to break down or fight.

Transitions

This 7 Roach Rush build is a strong 1 base attack that opens with a lot of units and few Drones, so your follow-up will be very slow. That being said, you should start to float some minerals as you are reaching your opponent?s base, so start a natural Hatchery, build a lot more Drones, and get Metabolic Boost as soon as possible. Going for a Lair and getting a Banelings Nest in order to start a Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk composition is a strong way to deal with Terran in the midgame.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong 1 base attack that can crush your opponent early before they have their midgame even established. However, this build can be held off if your opponent scouts it and prepares with a repaired Bunker or Marauders if they have opened with a 1 base play of their own. It also is much less economical than any Hatchery First openers.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Queen,Zergling,RoachWarren,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:34 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '15 Gas Raven Expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This fast expansion build created by Maru uses a lot of scouting in order to stay safe against Reapers and Banshees, getting out enough Marines and the infrastructure needed to defend all sorts of aggression that early-game TvT can have.

Scouting

Figuring out your opponents opening so that you can react appropriately when you are performing this build is crucial. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that you SCV scout around 12 or 13 supply in order to see whether your opponent has opened gas first or not.

If your SCV gets into your opponents base and sees that your opponents Barracks is delayed compared to yours, you know that they are opening gas first  the most likely scenario being Polts Gas First Banshee Build.  However, there are some Gas First Hellion openers, so stick around until the first Marine pops so that you can see what add-ons your opponent is making. A fast Tech lab usually will be swapped off onto the Starport for a fast Banshee. A fast Reactor can be used to swap off and go for Hellions.  Against Hellion play, build your Command Center and keep your Marines on the high ground.

If you get into your opponents base and see that your opponent has mined more gas than you have, the most likely scenario is that they are opening with Reapers. Note that even if you do not get into your opponents base, you can still tell a Reaper is coming by leaving your scouting SCV next to your opponents Barracks to spot whether the first unit to pop out is a Marine or a Reaper. Against Reaper play, build your Command Center and position your Marines on the high ground. If your opponent commits to 2rax Reaper or Mass Reaper play, transitioning into Innovations Marine/Hellion Expand to stay safe (instead of taking a 2nd gas and instantly opening with a Starport) is a common reaction. With the Reactored Hellion follow-up you can seize map control and deal with Reapers quite easily.

If your opponent is opening with an expansion of their own or has mined the same amount of gas as you have, then consider cutting the Raven and going into delayed Cloaked Banshee OR Siege Tank production of your own. Whichever you choose is personal preference.

When your second Orbital Command finishes and you are still worried about a 1 base play, consider scanning your opponents main base.  Against 1 base non-Banshee play, starting Siege Tanks and using your Raven for Seeker Missile is an easy way to stay safe. Against 1 base Banshee play, position your Marines and Raven near your production or mineral line as you start a Viking or two for extra defense.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either Marine/Tank/Medivac or Mech play.

When transitioning into Marine/Tank play, against Mech and 3CC builds you can get away with starting your 3rd Command Center right away and following-up with 2 Barracks with Tech labs (to start Stimpack/Combat Shields), 3 Refineries, and 2 Engineering bays.

Against a player opening straight into Bio play, however, it is necessary to start a Tech lab on your initial Barracks as soon as possible for a quicker Stimpack. Then, after taking a 2nd Refinery, you can build a 2nd Barracks onto the naked Reactor and start Siege Tank production to take yourself into the midgame. This is followed up by a 3rd Command Center (between 8:00-8:30), 1 more Barracks, both Refineries at your natural expansion, and 2 Engineering Bays. Not having Stimpack completed in time for the inevitable 10ish minute drop play can be a game changer because with the new Medivacs boosting around your main and natural, it is very easy to get caught out of position and take a lot of damage for free.

Another possible follow-up is going for Mech play. By starting a 3rd Command Center instantly, getting all 4 Refineries, and making 2 more Factories and an Armory, youll instantly be at the midgame infrastructure you need. Be sure to make Vikings for drop defense and start your Siege Tank production instantly so that you have a healthy Siege Tank count to defend any early drops/pressure.

Tips

- Fully read the Scouting section of this build before performing it in a game.  The reactions to scouting information as presented in the Scouting section must be learned before this build is even worth performing in a real game.
- SCV scout with this build at 12 or 13 supply.
- If you are absolutely sure your opponent is not opening with Banshee play, then starting delayed Banshee production of your own instead of the Raven is a great way to get midgame map control and a lot more scouting information.
- Against the first Banshee, you might need to pull all of your Marines to your production or mineral line while you wait for the Raven to pop.  This is completely fine  try to minimize damage by pulling all of your SCVs to one location so that your Raven provides detection over all of your vulnerable spots once it is out.
- Anticipate how many Banshees your opponent is making and either continue to produce Vikings or stop after 1 or 2 for safety.
- Be sure to transition into your midgame infrastructure as soon as you have successfully defended the Banshees.

Pros and Cons

This build defends early pressure quite easily, while getting a quick expansion and going into the midgame. Also, this build is incredibly versatile when it comes to transitions, for opening with a 1/1/1 grants you the freedom to transition into nearly anything.

However, this build requires a lot of scouting in order to be performed effectively.

The cool thing is that you don't even need to pressure with the units. You can, but really all you need to do is show that you have some sentries and zealots coming their way, send a hallucinationto scout and then stay at a watch tower and fake them into over reacting while you take a 3rd and tech to this wonderful thing called the Dark Shrine.

Now these aren't meant to be the fastest DTs in the world by any means, but they hit at such an awkward time that the zerg really shouldn't be expecting (especially after seeing a 3gate sentry pressure opening). So they have a chance to do quite a good deal of damage. Also, if they commit to a counter attack with the early units you forced out of them the DTs will do much more damage and you will also have your robo pumping out immortals at home to defend any roach follow ups that could happen.

After your cheeky DTs do their job you can saturate your 3rd and go up to +2/blink/immortal for a strong 3 base timing a few minutes after the DTs hit that can outright end the game if they aren't prepared or took too much damage from the DTs.

The high sentry count early on also makes it so you can throw out non stop hallucinations to really see what the zerg is up to an what tech they're choosing. If you see swarm hosts you of course need to throw down a robo bay and 2nd robo instead of doing the immortal +2 follow up otherwise you own't be ale to bust them. Mutas can also be dealt with via base trade quite well (so long as you identify it quickly enough and can hit while they're in production and you leave some cannons at your 3rd).

If they go for a high hydra count and it doesn't seem like your +2 blink immortal follow up can kill them then you can go into some form of splash damage while taking a 4th and just harassing them a bit to keep him away from your 4th and buy time for said splash damage.

This all-in gets the fastest possible Reaper with which to do damage against your opponent. It then follows up with another Barracks so that you can make enough Reapers to overwhelm your opponent and outright win the game before it has even begun.

Scouting

You will be doing this build no matter what, so there is no SCV scouting.  The rest of your scouting will come from your Reapers seeing what your opponent has. However, an interesting SCV timing to note: you will reach a very nice proxy location with your SCV on most 2 person maps if you send it out exactly as you get 50 minerals for the first time at 8 supply.

Transitions

There is no defined transition from this build; it is basically all-in after all.  However, if your opponent goes for very quick roaches then you might want to add-on Tech labs and get Marauders. Besides that, you should have enough Reapers to evenly trade with anything your opponent can make, as long as you can stutter step appropriately.

Tips

- Do NOT lose any of your first 3 Reapers. They are the most important part of this build  applying the early pressure, forcing Drones to be pulled, and most importantly stopping Queens/Roaches from being made. If you lose them, you will most likely lose the game.
- Do not stop for Hatcheries or buildings of any kind. Go straight for the Drones and force some to be pulled off the worker line. If your opponent has their full economy up they will simply outproduce you.
- The only micro you have to do is stutter step against Zerglings/Drones, and pull back the weakest Reaper against Queens.
- 4 Reapers will kill a Queen without you losing a single one of them as long as you pull the targeted Reaper back in time.
- In order to hit the exact build order supplies above, you will have to cut some SCVs for several seconds.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '15 gas FE into Mine Drop to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reactored Rax FE gives you enough Marines to stay safe against early Protoss pressure, while still getting a fast expansion. Then it transitions into a fast Marine/Widow Mine drop to hit your opponent with some pressure of your own. Interestingly, this build can also transition into standard Bio play or macro Mech play.

Scouting

This build is largely safe against any early pressure that Protoss can apply because it gives you a Reactored Barracks to pump out Marines two at a time. Also, if you are feeling unsafe, you have the minerals after your reactor finishes to place down a Bunker at your natural. Also, if your opponent is doing a 1 base all-in, then instead of being aggressive with your Marines/Widow Mines, you can keep them in your main and defend your Bunker/main. By simply constantly producing Widow Mines, Marines, and Medivacs to keep replenishing your defenses, you can remain safe against most all-ins. However seeing the all-ins coming is crucial. Scouting your opponents natural expansion timing with an SCV is huge (if your opponent does not have an expansion started by around 5:30, expect an all-in). Besides seeing an all-in coming, the rest of your midgame scouting will come from seeing how your opponent defends the Widow Mine drop.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because it gets a good economy, but also enough Marines to defend early game Protoss pokes. Then, the Marine/Widow Mine drop gives you complete map control AND keeps your opponent in the dark as to what followup you are doing (Mech/Bio/3CC). Not to mention that if your opponent is not careful, this build can get Widow Mines in your opponents mineral lines and land some huge hits on Probes, essentially winning the game instantly.

However, this build is more vulnerable to later all-ins such as Void ray or Blink+Mothership core all-ins than more standard bio play (because you will not have stim yet), so be sure to position your Widow Mines defensively and add on more bunkers against a Protoss that you have scouted isnt expanding. Also, with poor Medivac control, you can very easily lose your Medivac and all the Widow Mines if you are not careful. Lastly, this build is not quite as economical as a 1rax FE build, but it still gets a pretty reasonably fast expand, so its not too far behind a 1rax FE build in terms of economy at all.

Tips

- Early game Stalker/Mothership Core pressure may be hard to deal with, but position your Marines effectively and hold on until you get out a Widow Mine in order to defend your base.
- Once you have pinned your opponent on an aggressive build (for instance, by scouting a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), do NOT move out; instead, posture your Widow Mines and Marines in an appropriately defensive position.
- Oracles flat out destroy marines, so if you are fighting an opponent going for Stargate, position your Widow Mines by the mineral line and even consider getting out one turret per base.
- When committing to an attack, boost in and drop one Widow Mine at your opponents main-to-natural ramp in order to trap his army on one half of his base. Once you have his ramp locked down, you will have several seconds of complete control of the half of his base where his army is not located. Use these seconds to kill workers and/or position a mine in a crucial location.
- Above all else, the strength of this build is non-stop harass/pressure.

This variant on the standard 1rax FE build gets the midgame infrastructure up much earlier for a lot of midgame aggression, while sacrificing early safety against one and early two base Protoss attacks.

Scouting

When you send your scouting SCV, look for the number of gasses your opponent has, their Nexus energy, and also the units they are producing out of the Gateway. If he only has 1 gas before his stalker pops, check to see whether your opponent gets his natural at around 5:15 (You can hide your SCV nearby and then run it in around 5:30 to check for an expansion later if need be). If he has 2 gas or is not spending his chronoboost, then be wary of any sort of early attack.

Tips

- To confirm that your opponent is not all-inning you, have an SCV (or scan) go to his natural just before the 6 minute mark.  A 4gate will hit before this timing, but 2 bunkers and repair should be able to hold a 4gate easily enough; all other all-ins hit much later and this scout will give you enough time to mount an appropriate defense.
- You cannot afford Marauders with this build until you start the Starport. The 100 extra minerals and 50 gas from making 2 Marauders at a time will slow down the push by over a minute.
- Take map control when you initially poke out with your first two Medivacs. Do NOT engage Protoss yet though. This build sets up your infrastructure for a lot of reinforcements, but does not increase your army size until those reinforcements have actually arrived.
- Once the first or second wave of units from all 5 Barracks have popped (you should be making 3 Marauders and 4 marines at a time), straight up fight Protoss? army. Spread your army, kite Zealots, pick up units trapped between forcefields and zealots with Medivacs, and dodge storms as best you can. However, do not forget to build reinforcing units, and do not stop the aggression unless you are forced to. During this aggression, you also get to see what army composition your opponent has.  Get a 4th Refinery.  Then react appropriately to Colossus by making Vikings (and possibly a 2nd Starport) and to High Templar by making Ghosts.

Transitions

During the fighting, place down your 3rd CC, 2nd Engineering Bay and Armory, and Ghost academy or 2nd Starport to counter your opponent?s HTs or Colossi. Fighting your opponent across the map forces them to reveal which tech path they?ve gone down and safely give you the time you need to counter it before it comes to your base.

Pros and Cons

This 1rax FE variant cuts many early-game corners compared to other 1rax FEs.  Delaying the 2nd Refinery means that you cannot afford any Marauders at all until after your Starport has been started. Thus, in case your opponent does an early-game attack, you have to rely on Bunkers and SCVs to repair and tank damage much more than you would in other builds. However, what this build lacks in the early game it more than makes up for in the mid game. Getting five Barracks up that fast means that you can apply a lot of midgame aggression against your opponent.  With proper micro, it?s entirely possible to overrun the front with pure Marine/Marauder/Medivac even against Colossi or HTs, simply because of how many units you are reinforcing with.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,CommandCenter,SupplyDepot,SCV,Marine,CallMule,SCV,Bunker,Marine,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,Marine,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,CallMule,Marine,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,Bunker,Marine,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,SCV,StimPack,Refinery,SupplyDepot,Marine,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,CallMule,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,Factory,EngineeringBay,Refinery,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,CallMule,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,TechLabOnBarracks,ReactorOnBarracks,Marauder,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,CombatShield,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMedivacs,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnBarracks,ReactorOnBarracks', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:35 PM;

Simple, economical, and deceptively dangerous, Bomber takes us back to 2012 with an incredibly early 16 Marine Combat Shield Push that simultaneously takes a 6:00 3rd. An excellent low APM alternative for players who dislike Reapers and Hellions.

Scouting

Because you are not opening Reapers, you are in danger of unexpected Roach or Speedling attacks. And because you are not making Hellions, you will have difficulty confirming the existence of a Zerg third base if Speedlings are on the map, as well as being vulnerable to unscouted Baneling Busts. As such, your only SCV scout is crucial in determining if your Zerg opponent has opened with gas or not.

If your opponent has opened gasless, keep your scouting SCV alive and hidden as long as possible to confirm the existence of a third base by 6:30. If no third is taken by 6:30, it is worth scanning, as many dangerous builds, such as Soulkeys 1-1 Roach Timing, start gasless off of two bases.

If your opponent has opened gas but stopped mining at 100 gas, assume that Speedlings are on the way. As such, depending on how quickly your opponent chose to take his gas, a wall off is necessary before six minutes. It is fine to use your 3rd CC as part of your natural wall off on certain maps, such as Frost, Yeonsu, and Polar Night. However, if your opponent went for much faster Speedlings (Gas -> Pool -> Hatch), then it is advisable to wall off ASAP using Depots and bunkers, and delaying your 3rd CC. Additionally, consider not performing your Marine timing if the speedling count is abnormally high (30 or above).

If your opponent has opened gas but has continued mining past 100, it is necessary to check whether or not Metabolic Boost is researching with your scouting SCV. Beyond that, scan to see what is coming your way and build extra bunkers if necessary. You are specifically looking for a combination of the following: obvious tech cues (baneling nest, roach warren, fast lair), lack of Queens/Creep Spread (if there are only two injecting, then something is wrong), lack of Evolution Chambers, lack of a timely third base, and a flood of overlords.

It is highly reommended you do not perform your timing unless it is obvious your opponent is opening nonthreatening gas tech, such as Overlord Speed or very fast upgrades. And finally, depending on what you scout, if it becomes very obvious that no timing will occur, consider getting Stimpack instead of Combat Shields, as well as producing Marauders from your tech labbed Barracks.

Transitions

Because you have already invested so much infrastructure into Barracks and infantry upgrades, your only transition from this build is a bio based composition. However, because you have invested no money whatsoever into Factory tech, you can transition smoothly into Biomine, Biobat, Biobat with Thors, Marine Tank, or even Pure Bio.

Additionally, the Factory and Engineering Bay ordering is entirely up to the users discretion. If you feel you are in danger of a counter all in, or want faster Medivacs for aggression, then start the Factory first. If you feel that you do not want to fall behind in upgrades, start two Engineering bays first.

Tips

Your first priority with this build is accurately assessing whether or not you can do damage with a timing push.

If you feel you can do damage with the timing, do your best to ensure your opponent has as little idea of it as possible. Have lone marines ready at your base to deny Overlord scouting, and hide the bulk of your marines on the main ramp connecting to the natural base. Keep your Barracks away from the edges of your base; especially the one with a researching Tech Lab. If there is a way to construct a third base that an Overlord can obviously see it (such as by the natural choke at Polar Night, where there is almost always an overlord), then that would be best. Most Zergs upon seeing such an early third will let their guard down and drone heavily.

As youre moving out with the Marine squad at 7:00, have at least two scans saved and do your best to avoid obvious overlord positions, and either clear the towers beforehand (impossible vs Speedlings) or avoid them altogether if possible. The best possible scenario is you catch your opponent completely off guard with no Larva banked in the middle of a huge cycle of drones, with 16 marines at his third base.

Use your banked scans as best you can to clear huge swatches of creep, with priority on active tumors. If you do kill the third, use your discretion to decide whether or not attacking further into the natural (emphasis now on the Evolution Chambers or Nat Hatch) or retreating with your marines is the better choice.

DO NOT REINFORCE THIS PUSH. It relies heavily on the element of surprise. Once Zerg reacts and begins to produce cycles of defending units, your reinforcements (3 marines every 25 seconds) will be easily overwhelmed without force multipliers such as Widow Mines, Medivacs, or Battlecruisers.

During the actual engagements, stutter stepping and positioning are critical. Wedging all your marines into the mineral line of his third and using his hatchery as a choke seems to be the optimal engagement zone. If slow banes are involved, split as best you can without stim or target fire them down.

On the other hand, if you feel you cannot do damage with your timing, theres no problem whatsoever. Stay behind your walloff, make bunkers if necessary, and wait for Factory Tech and Medivacs to perform a standard creep clearing push. You are already ahead with your 6:00 3rd and triple MULE income.

Pros and Cons

This build is one of the most economical builds available while still having a surprising amount of potential to outright win a game. It also deflects non baneling based aggression excellently, such as Roach Ling timings. Additionally, the build has a surprising amount of creep clearing potential, as few Zergs will stand toe to toe with 16 Combat Shield Marines this early in the game; most Zergs will surrender their creep without a fight.

The weaknesses of this build, however, are equally apparent.If scouted, the push has a high chance of outright failing. In addition, because your infrastructure is so limited during and following the attack (3 mostly naked Barracks), you are extremely susceptible to counter all ins and heavy Baneling based counter attacks, especially after you kill their third but lose all 16 marines in the process.

And finally, because you have not opened Reapers or hellions, your information is extremely limited, and confirming the existence of a third base can be very difficult if you lose your scouting SCV too early on.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,OrbitalCommand,Marine,CommandCenter,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,Marine,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,OrbitalCommand,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Marine,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,CombatShield,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,CommandCenter,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Marine,Refinery,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,Marine,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,CallMule,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,EngineeringBay,EngineeringBay,ReactorOnBarracks,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,StimPack,OrbitalCommand,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,InfantryArmorLevel1,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Factory,Refinery,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marauder,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SCV,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Marauder,Armory,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,CallMule,TechLabOnFactory,Factory,SCV,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DrillingClaws,Barracks,Barracks,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,ConcussiveShells,InfantryWeaponsLevel2,InfantryArmorLevel2,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,ReactorOnFactory,CommandCenter,Marauder,DoubleMedivacs', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:35 PM;

If you want you can totally take a slightly later 3rd (~8-9 minutes) and just get 3 extra gates before the expand if you don't feel comfortable taking the fast 3rd. Just make sure you keep the robo timing the same.

This build really relies on you being able to scout with the oracle and reacting to what the zerg is doing. It's a very reactive and versatile opening which why I said it doesn't really die to anything as long as you execute it properly. Even if the stargate gets scouted/the oracle can't get too much done don't worry. You at least want to get scouting information with it as that is the most important. The drone or queen kills are only an added bonus if they aren't prepared.

If you see any sort of ling pressure to contest your 3rd then you should bring the oracle back to help defend. It's best to move the oracle down the common path of attack when it spawns to see if this kind of pressure is coming.

Any roach aggression can be stopped by earlier void ray production and even a few immortals before colossi if it's really early roach aggression.

Defending hydra/ling attacks is all about good sim city and forcefields and being sure your colossus doesn't get supply blocked or delayed at all. Your colossus being late is probably the worst thing you can do with this build as that's what really keeps you alive vs a lot of zerg pressure.

And of course if you see spire play then you have 3 stargates to make mass phoenix.

This Reaper FE, optimized by Startale Bomber, gets out exactly one Reaper for scouting as well and a ridiculously fast Command Center. Then it follows up with a Bio army with just as much strength as a gasless 1rax FE can provide.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they get an expansion (or note if they do not expand by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Also, if you do not know whether your opponent has a Stargate or not, it is a safe plan to build one Missile Turret per mineral line to defend any Oracle shenanigans.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and Medivacs. After this build, get a 3rd Command Center, 3 more Barracks (for a total of 8), and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to head into a strong, late game army.

Note: It is completely viable to replace the 4th and 5th Barracks in this build with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost, most Terrans (including Startale Bomber) have been getting lots of Barracks early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having those extra reinforcements.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important  be sure to mine exactly 100 Gas so that you have enough for the Reaper and Reactor and no more.  Getting your natural Command Center up before the 2nd Supply Depot is a strength of this build.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add a 2nd Bunker at the front, and consider getting a Missile Turret in each mineral line.
- Oracles, even with an expansion, massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you have to instantly get out one Missile Turret per mineral line.
- The gas timings of this build are somewhat more delayed than what you might be used to if you usually play with a gasless 1rax FE.  Therefore, be sure to cut all Marauder production until after your Starport has completed.
- When you move out with your Medivacs, be sure to boost in and out of where your opponent is expecting.  Forcing out the Mothership Cores energy can be the difference between an quick win and a potential loss.

Pros and Cons

This build is good because it gives you the economy and infrastructure on par with a Wings of Liberty style 1rax FE. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Getting such a fast Reactor gives you enough marines to defend early game Stalker + Mothership Core harass.  Finally, this build takes no detours and goes directly into Bio+Medivac play, so your Stim+Medivac aggression happens much sooner than if you go for an early Widow Mine Drop.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes, especially if you lose your Reaper.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Dear Flexible Phoenix Expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Stargate for Phoenix and some early ground units to provide the infrastructure necessary to react to every build an opposing Protoss might throw at you.

Benchmark: When your Nexus finishes (@6:45ish), you should have 3 Phoenix, 1 Sentry, 1 Stalker, a Mothership Core, and around 23 Probes.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker back to the protection of your Sentry quickly if you have to defend an early attack.

The majority of your scouting comes from your Phoenix. Your Phoenix should be able to get into your opponent?s main base and determine what tech route you see your opponent going.

- If your opponent is expanding quickly, then feel safe while applying some light harass with your Phoenix. You can dictate the pace of the game by committing to a lot of Phoenix or starting a Twilight Council or Robotics Facility and defaulting back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then be sure that deal some economic damage with your initial Phoenix. Either commit to Phoenix and Void Rays or default back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.
- If your opponent has a Stargate, then be sure to not take damage against early Phoenix or Oracles by initially positioning your units defensively.  Getting a healthy Phoenix lead against your opponent will most likely be enough for you to end the game.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then consider getting a Robotics Facility instantly in order to make one Observer for detection against DTs.  Alternatively, you can position your units with an Oracle at your main ramp and defend for a while. Regardless, do not make more Phoenix and instead transition into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame with your economic advantage.

Transitions

This build is a very safe opener that gives you the scouting capabilities and infrastructure to react to any build your opponent can perform. However, the actual steps you take to transition into a stable midgame often depend completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with. This is why scouting with your Phoenix and generally being active on the map (perhaps with a delayed scouting Probe) is crucial.

In Stargate vs Twilight macro games, harass your opponent with your Phoenix, but transition out of Stargate units into an economic Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame as soon as possible. In Stargate vs Robotics macro games, again harass your opponent to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you get a healthy Chargelot/Archon count up. Keep tabs on your opponent?s tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Stargate vs Stargate macro games, position your Phoenix more defensively while you chronoboost your Phoenix non-stop.

The most common way to start the transition into Chargelot/Immortal/Archon is by starting a Robotics Facility and 2 more Assimilators, followed by a Twilight Council and Forge for +1 Ground Weapons and Zealot Charge. Add on the Templar Archives and Archons when you can afford it.

Tips

- Once you start your Mothership Core, save your chronoboost so that you can dump it all into Phoenix. There is no need to chronoboost Warpgate (unless you spot your opponent going for very early aggression).
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial few Gateway units to stop a Probe from setting up a proxy Pylon and allowing for a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap?s 3gate All-in).
- Against Stargate play, position your Stargate units defensively around your mineral lines to defend potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- Otherwise, always be active with your Phoenixes. The main priority for the Phoenix is to get scouting information, for only when you have a full read on your opponent?s build can you can start chronoboosting probes and enter the midgame.
- Even though you open with a Stargate, transitioning into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon unit composition in the midgame can be very strong.
- When entering the late game, however, be sure to produce Tempest from your inactive Stargate?especially against a Colossus-based opponent.

Pros and Cons

This build is a versatile, economic build that can harass your opponent and provide the scouting information necessary to defend a fast expansion.  Also, your Phoenix can do terrible, terrible damage to Robo-based build such as duckdeok?s 3Gate Robo, and even perform well in a macro game against greedy builds such as NaNiwa?s Safe Expand.

However, this build requires a lot of scouting information to be executed effectively. It also is quite difficult to defend early attacks if you do not kill your opponent?s proxy Pylon.

This build opens with a 3 Gateways and Blink, using a Hallucinated Phoenix to scout for potential Dark Shrine or Stargate shenanigans. It produces a healthy Stalker count to apply pressure to your opponent or safely secure your expansion against any all-in.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker(s) back to the protection of your Sentry quickly if you have to defend an early attack.
The majority of your scouting comes from your Hallucinated Phoenix. Your phoenix should be able to get into your opponent?s main base and determine what tech route you see your opponent going.
- If your opponent is expanding quickly, then consider warping in Stalkers non-stop from a proxy Pylon as you all-in your opponent with a Blink all-in. Should you choose to expand instead, you will be slightly behind economically ? but with Blink.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then be sure that you do NOT over produce Stalkers.  Instead, expand and fall back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.
- If your opponent has a Stargate, then be sure to not take damage against early Phoenix or Oracles by initially positioning your Stalkers defensively. You can expand quite easily behind your Blink play and go into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame or all-in your opponent if you spot them taking a fast expansion behind the Stargate.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then consider getting a Robotics Facility instantly in order to make one Observer for detection against DTs. If you are sure your opponent is also opening with Blink, then constantly produce Immortals and defend a natural expansion OR skip the Robotics Facility entirely and try to win the Blink Stalker vs Blink Stalker micro war.

Transitions

This build is a very safe opener that allows you either to all-in your opponent with Blink Stalkers or transitions into a macro game quite easily. However, the actual steps you take to transition into it often depend completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with. This is why scouting with the Hallucinated Phoenix and generally being active on the map with your Blink Stalkers is crucial.
If you choose to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly produce Stalkers 3 at a time from your proxy Pylons and attack as soon as Blink Research is finished (@7:40ish). Bait out a Planetary Nexus and/or kill the Mothership Core and as many Sentries as possible before fully committing to an attack. If your opponent is on one base, you can still expand at home ? using your Sentry to force field the ramp to stop his army from coming down and engaging you with his entire army.
In Twilight vs Stargate macro games, abuse your mobility to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you have a strong midgame Chargelot/Immortal/Archon army ready. In Twilight vs Robotics macro games, again abuse your mobility to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you get a healthy Chargelot/Archon count up.  Keep tabs on your opponent?s tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Twilight vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponent?s potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by getting a Robotics Facility and producing Observers/Immortals or by winning the Blink Stalker vs Blink Stalker position battles in the open field.
The most common way to start the transition into Chargelot/Immortal/Archon is by starting a 2nd Nexus, a Robotics Facility and 2 more Assimilators, a Forge for +1 Ground Weapons, and Zealot Charge research in that order. Add on the Templar Archives and Archons when you can afford it.

Tips

- Once you start your Mothership Core, save your chronoboost so that you can dump it all into Blink Research. Only 1 or 2 chronoboosts should be spent on Warpgate (unless you spot your opponent going for very early aggression).
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial Stalkers to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap?s 3gate All-in).
- Against Stargate play, be sure to position your units to defend your mineral line from potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- If you choose to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly chronoboost Blink and then later your Gateways to get the maximal amount of units out with Blink as soon as possible. Bait out a Planetary Nexus and/or kill the Mothership Core and as many Sentries as possible before fully committing to an attack. If your opponent is on one base, you can still expand at home ? using your Sentry to force field the ramp to stop his army from coming down and engaging you with his entire army.
- If you choose to expand behind this build, do not produce more than 8 Stalkers which you should use to take map control and poke your opponent?s front. Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases. Transitioning into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon unit composition is very strong.

Pros and Cons

This build is a versatile, aggressive build that can pressure your opponent or defend basically any all-in with Blink Stalkers. It gets a fast Hallucinated Phoenix scout your opponent?s main base and let you know if you need detection, should reposition your army, or all-in your opponent.
However, this build requires a lot of scouting information to be executed effectively, so getting a Hallucination into your opponent?s base is crucial.

The opening is pretty simple and straight forward and easy to execute. The dark shrine can be proxied or it can be put in base. On 4 player maps its best to proxy it since you can put the proxy in a base far away from theirs while already on your scouting path so it's pretty convenient and you can pull some cute mindgames with a fake chrono on the twilight to fake blink if they scout you.

This build is pretty much safe vs any opening. Vs fast WG attacks you use overcharge to buy enough time to get the DT's out so you can defend and harass at the same time and abuse their lack of detection. If they're smart they will see your lack of units and start a late robo or forge, however you can usually keep it from finishing with how early your DTs come out.

Vs standard robo expands your nexus will be a little bit later, however you can either make up for this by using warp prism/DT harass or doing the blink follow up to abuse their low production capability.

Vs blink you obviously just kinda win so that's always nice.

Stargate openers are the only real problem. If they go phoenix they will usually scout with the first one and will be able to pick apart what you're doing. In which case you can just play more conservatively and get extra gates before you expand to be sure you don't die to a phoenix/gateway all in. Use the DT to determine if he's expanding or not so you can react properly. If they bank the phoenix then you basically just win.

If they go for oracle pressure they sometimes can just win if they're good at identifying early and remember to leave an oracle at home. Otherwise you can usually hold it off decently well but it is definitely the most burdensome to deal with (besides proxy oracle, which just blows in general.)

If they go DT's too then you have that weird thing where you just kinda continue normally as if nothing happened. That's why you get the robo obviously so you don't die vs their potential DTs.

This build opens with a 3 Stalker Rush to take map control, and follows up with a 1base 3gate Robo in order to pressure you opponent, get detection, and play safe against Blink/Stargate builds. This pressure build produces somewhat stable macro games if you react appropriately to your scouting information.

Scouting

For all early game scouting, please refer to the Scouting section of the 3 Stalker Rush build.

After your initial units have scouted around your side of the map, the majority of your scouting will come from your 3gate pressure at your opponent?s base.

- If your opponent is fast expanding, then attempt to cancel the Nexus before it finishes. Warp in more units at your proxy Pylon for extra pressure.
- If your opponent has just as many (or almost as many) Gateway units as you, immediately fall back and begin Immortal production. Against either Gateway attacks or Blink All-ins, you need a high Immortal count in order to defend.
- If your opponent does not have as many Gateway units as you, then push up the ramp and attempt to kill his army. Do NOT over-commit once your opponent has activated Photon Overcharge. If you cannot push up his ramp, then warp-in a Sentry or two at his natural and set up a contain while you expand back at home. If during the contain a Stargate unit flies into your base, be sure to activate your Photon Overcharge in order to keep your Probes alive.

Transitions

Once you have set up or a contain or you are forced to retreat back home, be sure to setup your natural expansion. Going into the macro game, however, the actual unit composition of your army very often depends completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with.  If your opponent stays on one base for too long, then throw down more Gateways, constantly make units, and prepare to defend your natural with Stalkers, Immortals, and your Planetary Nexus. In Robotics vs Stargate macro games, quickly switch into Blink or double Stargate play of your own so as to not lose against any Void Ray based armies. In Robotics vs Robotics macro games, Immortal count and/or Colossus count are the most important things. Keep tabs on your opponent?s tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Robotics vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponent?s potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by producing Immortals+Gateway units or Colossus for defense.

Tips

- Split your initial chronoboost on Probes and Warpgate Research in the early game so that you are not economically behind but still have a quick Warpgate attack.
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial 3 Stalkers to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap?s 3gate All-in).
- Against fast tech plays, your initial 3gate pressure should give you information on both the type and timing of your opponent?s attack. Be sure not to over-commit your Stalkers here, however, for Blink or Immortal all-ins will be able to hold your attack and counter-attack with a lot of force if you are careless with your initial units.
- Against Blink play (or your opponent has a lot of Stalkers when you pressure), be sure to pull back immediately and start Immortal production.
- Against Stargate play, use your Photon Overcharge to push back any Oracles or Phoenix if your Stalker army is out of position.
- Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very versatile, safe build that takes advantage of early Gateway units to apply pressure as well as defend every sort of all-in that can hit you. It also gets detection and Immortals for defense against ground-based all-ins, so very often you have a more stable opening than most other PvP builds.

However, this build forces you to be active on the map with your initial units.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'DeMusliM Reaper FE', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This HotS Reaper FE, optimized by Flash and DeMusliM, gets out exactly one Reaper for scouting and a ridiculously fast Engineering Bay for an early +1 Infantry Attack in order to hit a 10 minute timing with +1/+1, Stimpack, and Medivacs.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (opening with a Reaper FE means that you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they expand (or note if they do not get a fast expansion by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Also, if you do not know whether or not your opponent has built a Stargate, taking advantage of your ridiculously fast Engineering Bay to build a Missile Turret is not a bad idea too.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and Medivacs.  After this build, secure your 3rd Command Center, continue your upgrades with +2 Infantry Attack, build 6 more Barracks (for a total of 8), and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to go into a strong, late game army. Your fast third Command Center and early upgrades means that your late game army will be much stronger than your opponents assuming that you are able to deny their third base with your initial Medivac poke.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important  be sure to mine exactly 100 Gas so that you have enough for the Reaper and Reactor and no more.  Getting your natural Command Center up before the 2nd Supply Depot is a major strength of this build.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add a 2nd Bunker at the front, and consider getting a Missile Turret in each mineral line. 
- Oracles, even with an expansion, massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you have to instantly get out one Missile Turret per mineral line.
- The gas timings of this build are somewhat more delayed than what you might be used to if you usually play with a gasless 1rax FE.  Therefore, be sure to cut all Marauder production until after your Starport has completed.
- Try not to take any huge engages against your Protoss opponent with your initial Medivacs unless you are sure you can do damage.  With only 2 Barracks producing units, and such a fast 3rd Command Center, your army is not designed to outright win the game  rather to further your economic and upgrade advantage in order to win the game at a later point.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because it gives you the economy and infrastructure on par with a Wings of Liberty style 1rax FE. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Not to mention the fact that you also get a ridiculously early Engineering Bay in order to kick start your Bio upgrades very early. This build also takes no detours and goes directly into Bio+Medivac play, so your Stim+Medivac aggression happens much sooner than if you go for early Widow Mines.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes, especially if you lose your Reaper.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Blink into Robo', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'So this build still goes into colossus however it opens with a more aggressive stance that puts you in more control during the early parts of the game. Going straight for colossus double forge is extremely passive and leaves no real room for you to do much until you get your 3rd base saturated. However opening blink allows you that small amount of map control/versatility that we loved oh so much a few patches ago that was unfortunately ripped from our repertoire.

The other cool thing about this build is that unless they open gas first, you can do this build basically any game. Even 1 rax reaper into factory gets shut down by this since the 2nd observer comes out in time to deal with any widow mine drops that will come from that build. You can even do some follow up blink pressure with a lot of added stalkers to punish them while they're building their infrastructure up and their unit count is low.

Even the 3 rax stim builds that I made a thread on earlier this week can be stopped with this build. I found out really that once you see that build coming into form, then it's all about not being greedy with your tech and trying to get a colossus out ASAP or something like that. You just need to make as many units as possible out of your gateways. It won't hold it as well as the purely defensive robo/3gate style however you definitely can still make the hold so long as you get your gates at the time in this write up and not later like in some variants.

This build puts us back in control again which is what we have wanted for so long after blink/HT openers have been pushed out of style. Of course the only down side to this build is that the upgrades are later, however you can easily compensate for that with double forge and mass amounts of chronoboost being used into it. Since the build is so solid you shouldn't be losing too many probes to early harassment (early blink helps with that so much) so the only thing that you'll need to use your chronoboost on is the upgrades.

Adding a warp prism or two while you're getting your 3rd set up also meshes with this build very well. Many protosses (PartinG especially) almost always go for a warp prism to do a 4 zealot drop after they do some light harassment with the stalkers. It's just an added way to keep the terran back as you get your colossus set up and really keep the terran on their side of the map for as long as possible.

This aggressive build hits your opponent with relentless harassment, either outright winning the game or giving you a considerable economic advantage before even entering the midgame. Also, with Widow Mine and Banshee play, this build force a lot of scans  giving you another sort of economic advantage going into the midgame.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your 1st Refinery so as to check whether your opponent is opening Reapers or not. Against a Reaper player, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe and try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or an expansion at your natural with your first Marines.

Your next scout will come with your Widow Mine Drop. With this drop you can check what your opponents opener is. Against a Banshee player, you can following through with the build and trying to out-micro him in Banshee vs Banshee harass, or you can cancel your banshee and start a Viking and Engineering Bay for a Turret to play safe. Against a Hellbat Dropping player, make a few more Widow Mines to position them defensively against any incoming drop as you use your Widow Mine Drop and incoming Banshee to out-harass him. Against a player going for a similar Widow Mine Drop, you can either pull back and try to defend or attempt to do more SCV damage with your drop than he does with his.

Finally, when your first Banshee starts its harass, you will get a good look at everything else your opponent is doing when trying to transition into the midgame. Keep an eye out for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either Marine/Tank or Mech play quite easily.

When transitioning into Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production early in order to have a safe defense and later strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use.
- Keep your eyes peeled for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop a drop or Banshee. Do NOT drop on top of an active Widow Mine.
- With your initial Widow Mine drop, avoid Turrets at all costs. The main purpose of the drop is to force multiple scans, with a side goal of dealing crippling economic damage.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that were already weakened by the initial drop before attacking any of the full health SCVs.
- If your opponent has a Missile Turret already set up in his mineral line, then do not worry. Instead, camping a Terrans production with a Widow Mine and several Marines can be just as effectiveespecially with the Banshee follow-up that hits soon after.
- Always favor keeping your Medivac and Banshee alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural. You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very strong, aggressive play style that opens up with unrelenting harassment before even entering the midgame. With a Widow Mine drop and Banshee follow-up, you can kill many SCVs and also force your opponent to scan often  giving you another type of economic advantage. Finally, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for opening with a 1/1/1 grants you the freedom to go into nearly anything.

However, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades. Also, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,Factory,Refinery,CallMule,SCV,Marine,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,Starport,WidowMine,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,WidowMine,Medivac,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnStarport,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,Banshee,CloakingField,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,Banshee,TechLabOnFactory,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:35 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Dear Phoenix into Colossus', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Forge Fast Expand and then gets several Phoenix for map control and scouting. While you are using the scouting Phoenix, you transition into Colossus play in order to secure your third base and set up a stable midgame OR all-in your opponent with a Stalker/Colossus/Phoenix army.

Scouting

After any early game shenanigans are ruled out, as you have spotted your opponent s third Hatchery going down, the rest of your scouting will come from your Phoenix.

Use your Phoenix to first pick off every Overlord on the map that is undefended by creep/Queens. Then use them to poke around your opponent s base   picking up units not protected by Spore Crawlers/Queens. Be sure to focus on what tech structures you see your opponent making. If you spot a swell of Roaches, stay on 2 bases and consider extra Immortals. If you spot a Hydralisk Den, be sure your Robotics Bay is constantly producing Colossus. If you spot a Spire, instantly get a Twilight Council and go for Blink/+2 Ground Weapons while you resume Phoenix production from your Stargate. You might have to cancel your Colossus production.

Transitions

This build can either all-in off of 2 bases or safely secure a third base to comfortably play a macro game.

If you are choosing to all-in with this build, be sure to go up to 8 Gateways and 3 Colossus with Extended Thermal Lance before moving out. Constantly reinforce with Stalkers as you use your +1/+1, 3-Colossus, 5-Phoenix, 8 Gateway all-in to crush through a Roach/Hydra based army. Watch out for Viper play, though!

If you are choosing to play the macro game, timing your third base is tricky. Dear warps in a lot of Zealots from his 4 Gateways before securing his third if he sees any amount of units on the map with his constant Phoenix scouting. If Dear doesn t see any Roach/Ling force out on the map (as in game 3 of Dear vs Soulkey), then he will take it even before his first Colossus is started. As you take your third base, set up a Cannon defense surrounded by Pylons/Gateways to help with Zergling runbys as you tech up into the late game. Getting a Twilight Council to continue +2 Ground Weapons and Blink is a solid way to both deal with tech switches and set you up for a 3 base attack. Be sure to spend your excess minerals on proxy Pylons and Zealot runbys to keep your opponent s base count in check.

Tips

- Spend all of your early game chronoboost on your two Nexus to maximize Probe production.
- The exact FFE build order you use is up to your personal preference. Dear has performed this build after a Forge First FFE, Nexus First FFE, and a failed attempted Cannon Rush.
- If possible, hide the Stargate somewhere in your base that is less likely to be scouted by an Overlord.
- Chronoboost your Stargate to get out those Phoenix as quickly as possible to deny any Overlord scouting of your follow-up Robotics transition.
A main strength of this build is its versatility, but you can only be versatile if you have the necessary scouting information. Scouting your opponent s tech path and army production with your Phoenix is crucial.
- If you spot your opponent playing very greedy, you can choose to warp-in all of your Zealots from your 4 Gateways aggressively and hit a +1 Zealot/Phoenix timing while continuing the build at home.
- Chronoboost your Robotics Facility to get out your Colossus as quickly as possible and set up a solid midgame army.

Pros and Cons

This build is an incredibly versatile build that can be used as a macro opener or a 2 base all-in. It gets out early Phoenix for scouting and map control while transitioning into a solid ground based Colossus midgame.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your Orbital Command to check whether or not your opponent is opening with Reapers. Against an opponent opening Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe; thus, you should try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or expanded at your natural with your first few Marines.

Sacrifice your hellion on 35 supply to get intel + allow yourself to get more scvs while supply depot is building.

Against another Banshee player, follow-up your first Banshee with a Raven (and then potentially Viking if extra anti-air is needed). Against a Hellbat dropping player, make a few Widow Mines to burrow defensively against any incoming drop, as you use several Banshees to out-harass him. Against a player going for a Widow Mine Drop, position your Marines defensively at home and be sure to have enough scans to deal with his Widow Mines. Building a Raven might be useful, but not until after you have 2 Banshees with which to harass your opponent.

Finally, be sure to keep an eye out on what midgame transition your opponent is doing. Look for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either all-in, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play quite easily.

For an all-in transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory and start Siege Tank production instantly. When you hit 2 or 3 Siege Tanks, grab all of your Marines (>20), your Banshees/Vikings, and attempt to break your opponents front with a slow siege push.

It is possible to go into Marine/Tank or Mech after a 3 Command Center follow-up if you are sure your opponent will not be going for any more early game pressure. Start a Raven in order to save enough minerals to afford 2 Command Centers and then transition into either Marine/Tank or Mech just as below.

When transitioning into macro Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production after you start a 2nd Command Center. That way you have enough defense early and later can have a strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use. Against 2rax Reaper, you should delay your Tech lab until your Factory has completed at least one Hellion. Otherwise you might straight up die before you even start your first Banshee.
- Watch for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop your Banshee as you enter your opponents base.  Cloak your Banshee as soon as you see any potential for burrowed Widow Mines.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that are undefended by a Turret. If you are transitioning to a 1/1/1 all-in, then be sure to target-fire Marines as well, for this directly strengthens your attack.
- Always favor keeping your Banshee(s) alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two. You can also repair a weakened Banshee at home with SCVs if you can keep it alive.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural.  You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This gas first Banshee build is an aggressive opener in TvT. Also, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for you are able to transition into an all-in, 3 Command Center play, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play. Also, this build requires a lot less APM than other TvT builds, so it can be very useful for lower league players.

However, this build is extraordinarily weak against early Reaper builds because you open with so few Marines. Also, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind your opponent in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades, especially if they open with a fast expansion.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Creator Blink-obs expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'This build allows for a huge amount of versatility by being able to deal with pretty much any opener they can throw at you.

The idea is that you get a lot of units out of 1 gate while teching up to blink and robo so that way you can easily split your forces to deal with the variety of openings that can come at you. Once you determine your position in the game, you can easily expand and start teching up to immortal/archon.

So how exactly do you deal with the different openings?

Stargate:

This is a fairly simple one. Most of the time you won't be able to see that they're going stargate (unless it's a very quick directly after cyber build) in which case you will be playing defensively with your units anyway. Whether it's phoenix or oracle you will have 3 stalkers and a MSCore to deal with whatever comes at you with an additional 3 stalkers coming out of WG once that finishes, with blink soon following. This allows for a very easy stargate defense in which case you can then expand and put on light pressure with your blink/obs while defending at home with the MSCore.

If you want you can cancel the robo to go for a blink all in after seeing this, however some people (like Zest in the Shoutcraft tournament) will go for stargate and then DT to follow it up if they see you do blink/robo expecting you to cancel it. However this is usually because of pros at the highest level trying to get every ounce of their money for something beneficial, so it was mostly a smart gamble by Zest.

Blink:

With blink you're going to have to identify it a little early. If you see a large stalker opening then blink should be in the back of your mind. In this case you can easily get an immortal out with time bought by overcharge so you can have blink + immo to his pure blink. If he commits heavily then you can usually just counter push for the win, or you can simply expand and be ahead since you have the tech advantage.

DT:

This is quite simple as well. Robo finishes, you get an obs out, you kill DTs, you expand and continue as normal.

Robo expand:

In this situation your nexus will be slightly farther behind than his, however you will have the ability to poke and prod at him with blink so the slightly later nexus is not the biggest of deals. You will have added mobility and you will also know that they are being super passive so you can chrono probes nonstop to get back on the same economic footing. The best thing you can do with your stalkers is to pick off sentries that you see in the front. This denies him scouting (no hallucination) and requires him to waste gas he doesn't want to replenish them if he really wants to.

After you defend whatever build your opponent is going for and you have your natural set up, you want to simply transition into immortal/archon.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,GoOutProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Zealot,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Stalker,Chronoboost,WarpgateUpgrade,Pylon,Probe,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Stalker,Probe,TwilightCouncil,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon,Blink,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Stalker,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Observer,Nexus,WarpInSentry,Probe,Pylon,Immortal,Probe,Probe,Forge,Probe,Probe,Pylon,GroundWeaponsLevel1,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Immortal,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Immortal,Probe,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Charge,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,GroundWeaponsLevel2,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Immortal,Pylon,TemplarArchives', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:35 PM;

You use the zealot to help ferry the probe across the map and keep the pylon alive so you can get a zealot warp in and then have your oracle follow up afterwords. You either should target and timewarp the queens he has trying to defend the 3rd, and then clean them up with the oracle, or bait them all down and then go in to a queenless mineral line to get a ton of drone kills. It's all up to your judgement.

After that youcgo for very fast charge, archons, and +1 attack and then zealot/archon timing to kill the 4th base of the zerg. It hits at such an awkward time that the zerg never expects it and you're taking a 3rd behind it as well so they don't even think you're going to attack.

The other reason it's so good though is because zealot/archon at that stage in the game is probably the best unit comp per cost vs anything the zerg could have made. If they try to go formass lingsat that stage to hold off the zealot pressure, then zealot archon is obviously going to destroy that. If they go forhydrasthe count won't be high enough and as long as you can trap them with FF's you'll destroy them as well. If they goroachesthen you probably can't end them with this push, but if you can get good forcefields and get the zealots in the faces of the roaches then you'll do quite well since zealots are actually better vs roaches if they can get in their face (which is what charge + FF does). If they goswarm hostsyou'll hit right as they're popping usually so they'll be in quite low numbers. You can do a good amount of damage before you have to pull back to an observer from the robo you made while pushing. The only big trouble with this build is mutas, however like the swarm hosts you'll be hitting as they pop. With 3-4 archons and a wave of stalkers afterwords you can easily deal with low numbers of mutas. If they are able to get a good 12-13 at once you're gonna have to back up and immediately make 2 extra stargates and start phoenix production.

If you don't end the game with the zealot/archon push then you can simply transition into whatever tech is required vs what the zerg chose. You can start warp prisms with the robo you made and then go into colossus and blink, or you can make warp prisms and continue down TC path with storm and then add some void rays.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Harstem 1 gate FE to Blink-Colossus', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a 1gate FE, and transitions directly into both Blink and Colossi. With these two tools you can safely secure your main and natural from both frontal pushes and backdoor drops.

Benchmark: When your first Colossus finishes (@9:00ish), you should have 1 Colossus, 3 Stalkers, a Sentry, a Mothership Core, 2 Observers, and around 50 Probes.

Scouting

This build is a safe build that gets detection and a lot of early game Stalkers, so Probe scouting is unnecessary. Use your initial Stalkers to ward off any of your opponent?s Reaper(s) or scout the front of your opponent?s base if they are opening with a Command Center First.

Most of your scouting will come from your 2 Observers. Send the first directly to your opponent?s main in order to spot what infrastructure is being built. Send the second to a common attack or drop path so that you have vision of when your opponent is moving out.

Against early Widow Mine drops, position your units defensively and consider delaying Colossus production in favor of more Observers.

Transitions

With Blink, Colossus, and Observers, you should be able to safely secure your main and natural expansions. Against bio play, consider getting 4 or 5 more Gateways while continuing your upgrades and taking your 3rd base as soon as you are safe to.

Alternatively, you are also able to go for a 2 Base, +2 Blink Stalker/Colossus all-in with this build.  Simply get your Ground Weapons upgrades instead of Ground Armor, and throw down 7 more Gateways after you start your Colossus production in order to break your opponent with simply Stalkers and Colossi.

Tips

- Chronoboost your Nexii constantly in order to get an economic advantage.
- Use your initial Stalker(s) to ward off any opposing Reapers and/or take a Xel?Naga Watchtower to see a push coming.
- Position your Robotics Facility, Forge, and Twilight Council in a central location to prevent them from being killed during a drop.
- Your Observers are the main way you can position your army to adequately defend multi-pronged aggression ? replace them if they are scanned and lost.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with both Blink Stalkers and Colossi, rushing for all the tools you need to defend Terran aggression.  With strong upgrades and a mobile unit composition, this build allows you to enter the midgame ridiculously quickly.

This 1gate FE follows up with a 6gate, 2 base Blink Stalker attack, using the Mothership Core for high ground vision and Time Warp.

Benchmark: When Blink finishes (@7:40ish), you should have with 6 Stalkers and 36 Probes at home.

Attack your opponent?s natural/main with your first full warp-in from all 6 Gateways (@8:30ish) with 12 Blink Stalkers and constant Stalker reinforcements.

Scouting

This build is an aggressive opener that makes a lot of units, so you will not have to worry about Probe scouting. Against Reaper play, keep your first Stalker on a common hop-up ledge in order to deny your opponent scouting the Twilight Council. Against other defensive play, poke out to your opponent?s front with your first Stalker and check to see whether your opponent is going for Widow Mines or a quick CC into Bio so you know how to micro when you Blink into his main base with all of your units.

Transitions

This build is a strong 2 base Blink Timing that commits a lots of resources to Stalkers and no resources to upgrades or tech, so your follow-up will be quite slow. If your attack does damage and you keep most of your units alive, then you can start 2 more Assimilators, 2 Forges, and a Templar Archives, in order to transition into a Chargelot/Storm unit composition with Blink Stalkers to help deal with drops. However, if you do not deal some damage with your initial Stalkers, then you will be behind both economically and in tech against an opponent who will have Stimpack and Medivacs soon to follow.

Tips

- Do not bother Probe scouting early on because you can do this build against nearly everything your opponent chooses to open with.
- With your initial Stalkers, either protect your main base from a Reaper scouting your Twilight Council or move out and poke up at your opponent?s base for some early scouting intel.
- The limiting factor with this build is Blink Research?s build time and finishing your 6 Gateways, so be sure to Chronoboost Blink Research constantly in order to attack as soon as possible.
- Keep your Mothership Core out of harm?s way.  Use its 14 sight range for high ground vision, but do not commit the Mothership Core in the attack because without high ground vision, your attack will most likely fail.
- Do not forget to use your Mothership Core?s Time Warp ability to help pick off SCVs or Bio units that are out of position.
- Do NOT over-commit your Stalkers in a risky blink. Only aggressively blink to get up to a high ground or to pick off a Siege Tank/Widow Mine before it activates.
- Constantly warping-in more Stalkers to reinforce your army and add strength to the attack is key to crushing through your opponent?s defenses.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong build because of how quickly you get both high ground vision with your Mothership Core and enough Blink Stalkers to do real damage ? after opening with a 1gate FE. While your opponent might have Stimpack done in time for the attack, you can still beat your opponent in the open field if you use Time Warp and Blink appropriately.

However, this build commits a lot of resources to the attack, so transitioning into standard play will be much further behind if you had just rushed for High Templars and upgrades. Also, if your Stalker positioning is sub-optimal, a Reaper may scout your Twilight Council and reveal the build before you have even moved out to attack.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Nexus,MothershipCore,WarpgateUpgrade,Pylon,Stalker,GasProbe,GasProbe,TwilightCouncil,Probe,Probe,Stalker,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Blink,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,WarpInStalker,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,Probe,Probe,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:36 PM;

This 2 base, Hatchery-tech Roach-Speedling all-in crushes through Void Ray-less Stargate or heavy Gateway Protoss openers, both out of a Gateway Expand or Forge Fast Expand.

Scouting

Send your first Overlord to scout your opponent?s natural wall to spot for a Forge Fast Expand or Gateway Expand, and then send it to a safe area for a later 7:00 scout.  Consider using your 2nd Overlord to guard your natural expansion against Cannon Rushes. Your next Overlords can be placed around your opponent?s main or natural base as backup scouts or for vision of their 3rd base.
Use your initial Zerglings to scout around the map for Probes and proxy Pylons. Keep a Zergling outside his front to scout for any early pokes, and avoid any Stalkers or the Mothership Core whenever possible.
The majority of your scouting will come from the Roach/Ling all-in. Note whether or not your opponent has opened with a Stargate, Robotics Facility, or Gateway-heavy army, and react accordingly.

Transitions

This build is a 2 base Roach/Ling all-in off of only 27 Drones, so there is no well defined transition. That being said, if the attack is not going well, be sure to pull back and keep your units alive, instantly resume Droning, and attempt to secure a third base and 3rd Queen.  Going for Lair and Roach Speed or Hydralisks is probably your best way to defend the inevitable counter-attack, but you might be too far behind (based entirely on how much damage your all-in did) for it to be enough.

Tips

- Be active on the map with your initial few Zerglings in order to deny vision of the fact that you do not have a 3rd Hatchery (and especially that you have mined more than 100 gas just for Metabolic Boost).
- Roaches take up a lot of supply, so be sure to start several Overlords BEFORE you need to make the 8 Roaches.
- During the all-in, keeping up on your injects so that you have enough Speedling reinforcements could be the difference between a close game and an easy slaughter.

Pros and Cons

This is a very strong 2 base all-in that uses Roach/Ling to crush your opponent before the midgame has even started. It also requires little scouting and little APM to perform well, so it is a great build for newer players to perform as well.
However, if your opponent spots your lack of third base early on, they should have enough time to wall off their natural with Photon Cannons if they opened with a FFE or get out enough Sentries if they opened with a Gateway Expand.

Build is extremely aggressive and start off aggressive early on as well. In this one the initial zealot and MSCore are sent directly to the zergs 3rd to do some harassment. The whole goal of this build is to keep the drone count as low as possible before doing the full immortal/sentry push and this is stage 1 of that goal. You send the zealot/MSCore to his 3rd to maybe pick off a drone or even a queen but also to force an early set of lings. Losing the zealot will be almost inevitable however do NOT lose the MSCore. That will make your little poke 100% not worth it. You may not always be able to do this push as sometimes the zerg will open gas early and will have speed out by this time, so make sure you're scouting to see exactly when the gas goes down.

Part 2 of the "keep the drones low" goal is with an early warp prism pressure. Most immortal/sentry all ins don't have this step in it, they just go right for the attack and let the zerg drone and make whatever he wants before the attack. This little drop of 1 immortal and 2 sentries (preferably behind the mineral line in an abusable location) forces even MORE things that aren't drones as well as allows you to kill a decent amount. If you're good with your micro as well you can keep the drop going by going into the main and doing a FF drop and warping in (as your first 4 gateways will be done at this time) however that option may not always be available. Also be sure to bring the MSCore with this drop, if things go terrible wrong you can always recall which is why it's important to not lose the MSCore in the initial poke.

All the while this pressure is happening you're going up to 3 immortals and 9 gateways and making a ton of zealot/sentry and moving across the map. If you can keep him pre occupied with the warp prism all the while you're moving across the map then that's even better. However your goal is complete at this point.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'HerO greedy blink into DT drop', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'Early game opening

The build starts off very standard. It's a normal 1 gate FE blink opening. You get your twilight council on 29 supply after 1 stalker and then a 2nd stalker afterwords. Lately people have only been going 2 stalkers in the early game instead of 3 so that way they can fit in 2 gateways at 36 supply while opening blink as well. This would make it so that the 2 extra gates (3 in total) would be finished right when WG was done. Before that, literally everyone opened 3 stalkers but with a later 2nd and 3rd gate that didn't quite finish when WG was done. This build is a best of both worlds and what I assume might become the standard now for defensive blink openings. herO goes for a 2nd gate at 34 supply instead of 2nd and 3nd at 36, which allows him to still get the 3rd stalkerfrom the gateway. Then once WG is finished researching, he warps in 2 more to get that nice number of 5 which is what you would get normally anyway. So you basically end up at the same thing (just with 1 less gateway since you aren't planning on being super aggressive with the blink) but now with 3 stalkers early to help defend instead of 2. It's a small little variation, but a rather useful one to give you that nice defense of 3 stalkers before WG is finished while still ending up with a nicely timed tech and gateway count.

One other important thing to note: herO onlychronoboosts his blink research ONCE. Yeah...only once. That's very rare. He instead puts all chrono into his probes to get full saturation and simply waits for blink to finish. So basically you can completely focus on chronoing probes if you want. If you forget to chrono blink once it doesn't even matter cause apparently not even herO does that sometimes with this build.

Extra tech and mid game transition

With every defensive blink opener we need a robo right? Luckily for us, herO gets the timing for the robo down absolutely perfectly. Literally the earliest we could need an observer after a standard 1 rax reaper FE is around 8 minutes. When does the observer come out of this 6:35 timed robo? 8 minutes. This will allow you to defend any 1 rax reaper FE into factory builds with relative ease (as long as your control and map awareness are on point) and give you a strong edge going into the mid game.

All the while this is going on, a very sneaky and early timed dark shrine has been placed at 7:30. This is earlier than the Trap build I used in the past (which went down at about 8 minutes), which adds to the greediness of this build. This earlier dark shrine allows you to time up a nicely executeddual pronged attackwith7 stalkers and 3 DTs in a warp prism. This is showcased brilliantly vs Flash from Proleague. As you drop the DTs in, you also do some poking with the blink stalkers at the bunker or any SCVs near the front. Or you can do it visa versa. Distract and fake blink all in by poking at front bunker --> drop DTs into main. He continues doing this for quite a long time which allows him to do the next step in the build.

While this DT/blink harass is going on, herO makes some decisions that REALLY enforces the greedy aspect of the build. Not only does he get a robo bay AND two forges during the 8th minute, he also EXPANDS at 9:20.He is heavily relying on his blink/DT harass to scare of the Terran to allow him to get away with this.He even starts +1/+1 BEFORE a colossus. At 11 minutes into the game his unit count is literally 61 probes, 1 DT, 1 colossus, 7 stalkers, 1 warp prism and a MSCore. If the Terran makes a strong defense of the blink/DT harass then a counter attack is extremely lethal and potentially game ending. If you don't feel safe being this greedy, then by all means delay the 3rd base and get a few gates before hand while you get a colossus and a sentry or two. Most terrans will want to be attacking you more often than not so it's better to play a little safer on ladder anyway. This build obviously is being done this greedy due to the fact that herO is playing against Flash.

Late game

The build transitions quite easily into late game. After your 3rd is saturated you get a nice gateway explosion of up to about 12-14 or so. You start +2/+2 right when 1/1 is done and then a Templar Archives shortly after for storm. herO also gets warp prism speed for some random reason. I guess he just feels he has the money to get it so he does. I personally would prefer observer speed since it's a little more helpful (since warp prisms are fairly fast already now) and if you're going to spend your money on something like that at that point in the game, it might as well be for observer speed since it's so vital later on. However, from there it's a fairly standard PvT game.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'HuK 5gate Warp Prism Attack', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with 2 Stalkers and a Mothership Core to take map control, and then follows up with a Warp Prism and 5 Gateways to drop the main of your opponent and force field him out of his own base.

Benchmark: When your Warp Prism finishes (@7:05ish), you should have around 32 Probes, 2 Stalkers, 4 Sentries, 1 Warp Prism, and a Mothership Core.

Scouting

This build is most effective against gasless openers from Terran, and quite ineffective against 1 base plays. Thus, be sure that you confirm your opponent doing a Reaper FE, CC First, or 1rax FE build with either your Probe scout at 13 supply or with your initial Stalker poke. If your opponent has not opened with an expansion, then abandon the Warp Prism and go instead for 2 more Assimilators, a Robotics Bay, double Forge, and standard macro PvT play. If your opponent has opened with an expansion, then proceed with this build and be sure to force field your opponent out of his main base.

Transitions

This build is a strong, 5 gate attack off of 2 bases with only 2 Assimilators.  Thus, you have to damage with this attack if you want to go into the midgame with an advantage. Assuming you do no damage and you lose the Warp Prism, you will have a very hard time coming back in the game, and should play stupidly greedy if you want a chance to come back. If you do some damage with this build but eventually lose everything, then you might still be in the game; transition by getting both Assimilators at your natural and go into a standard Colossi/Forge midgame. If you do a lot of damage and save some of your army with the Warp Prism, then you can feel free to take a greedy third base instantly while transitioning directly into Colossi+upgrades off of double Forge.

Tips

- Use your initial Stalkers and Mothership Core for map control and early game scouting. Only build the Warp Prism if you are playing against an expanding Terran. Get your natural?s Assimilators and go into Colossi if you see your opponent staying on one base.
- Against Reaper play, keep at least one Stalker at home in order to defend your Probes and/or stop him from seeing your Warp Prism.
- When you finish your Warp Prism, load up your 4 Sentries instantly and head directly for your opponent?s main base.
- Poke your opponent?s front with your Stalkers before you go into the main with your Warp Prism to make sure that your opponent has all his units at his natural.
- Drop your Sentries on the high ground near your opponent?s ramp to instantly force field him out.
- Transform your Warp Prism into Phasing Mode and constantly warp-in 5 units at a time, favoring Zealots and Sentries.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with your Stalkers/Mothership Core to easily defend Reapers as well as take map control. Then, with the scouting intel that your Probe and Stalker poke give you, you follow up with a very early Warp Prism and 5 gate attack in order to drop in your opponent?s main while you force field him out. Against a non-expand build, you have the Robotics Facility and can get Observers or Immortals to play safe.

However, opening with this build delays your midgame tech by a lot. By only staying on 2 Assimilators, you do not have the gas income to go into Colossi instantly, and thus have to rely on your Warp Prism doing damage to get a leg up on your opponent. Also, this build relies a lot on early game scouting in order to ensure that your opponent is going for a standard expansion into Bio play.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,MothershipCore,Stalker,Chronoboost,Probe,Nexus,Probe,RoboticsFacility,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Chronoboost,WarpPrism,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpInSentry,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInSentry,WarpInSentry,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:37 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'HerO Speedprism colossus drop into storm drop', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'This build is kind of crazy. Like I said it's a bit challenging butif you want you can just incorporate the main ideasof the build into your own standard robo openings that you're familiar and comfortable with. The build starts with a fancy 2 gas opener with probes being rallied in 1 at a time after you have full mineral saturation. If anyone remembers a long time ago the SaSe aggressive 3 gate opening that Day9 did a daily on, it's very similar to how the gasses were filled in that build. Whether or not it's better to do it this way or to just do a normal 2 in each or 1 with 3, I don't really know. I'm sure you can get to the same out come with whatever gas opener you're familiar with but if you wanna be try hard and feel cool then go ahead and try this method. I personally found it quite smooth when I tried it.

Now the build starts with a normal robo timing just like any other standard opening. The natural gasses are a bit earlier however since the build is quite gas intensive (you'll also need the extra gas for 2 sentries while teching up heavily to be able to defend). That's another thing you can simplify if you'd like if you don't think you'll remember to fill the gas up later on. Once the robo bay is done you'll get your first colossus but instead of getting range you get warp prism speedto aid in your colossus drop harassment. Since we aren't committing fully to colossus we won't need range this early and instead we put that gas towards a fast twilight council to go into storm for a 2nd form of harassment in the storm drop.

Once your harassment with the colossus starts you should be getting a few extra gateways to prepare for any medivac timing the terran may want to use. Your extra resources should also be put into some immortals while you wait for your tech to get up. You should also be sure towarp in 2 HT's when you start storm so by the time storm is done you can immediately go and use them for the storm drop.So once storm is done, bring the colossus home and switch it for the HT's and go for round 2 of your wonderful harassment. You can also warp in archons at home to help defend and bolster your army. You'll have quite the beefy army with immortals and archons and storm with 1 colossus. If you remember the old rangeless colossus into storm builds, this is very similar to that except that you're doing harassment with the first colossus.

From the storm drop you simply add on more gates as you feel necessary and get the upgrades and charge going and transition into a normal macro game. You get your 3rd when you feel safe and you can transition into 2 robo colossi whenever you feel comfortable to throw the terran off even more.

Simplifications/Alternative Follow ups

If you feel the colossus drop into storm drop is a little too much for you (opening storm these days isn't always the easiest thing in the world) then you can very easily just continue down the colossus tech route.The extra resources you will bank by not going twilight tech can be used for earlier gateways or earlier double forge. Or you can go into twilight still and go for blink for an easier drop defense option.

Something else you can do is do a big7gate colossus all in like Classic did vs Polt on Nimbus at Blizzcon.

If you still want to go down the storm route but feel like you're kind of skimping on defense by loading your first to HT's to do a drop, then you can also easily justplay more passive after the colossus drop.You can play it like the old rangeless colossus into storm builds like I mentioned and wait for the terran to sac a little bit into your unexpected storm transition. At that point you should feel more safe to incorporate some storm drops into your play.

Again, while this may not be the most solid or perfect build, it is a way to freshen up your games and force you to try some fun early game harassment that normally you aren't able to do.

The cool thing about this build as well since it's less all in, is that if it gets scouted you can easily transition out of it and harass with an immortal drop or a sentry drop in the main and FF the ramp. This is because of the fact that you actually get the natural gasses.

Just a few things you have to remember about this build is that you have to be aware of speedling all ins. This is because your natural wall off is going to be a bit later than most builds, so you want to be sure that nothing is hitting you before you can get it down. If needed you can wall off quicker if you see something coming.

Also make sure you hide your robo fairly well. If a zerg sees that fast of a robo they're going to expect something so it's best to hide it as much as possible. But like I said, even if it gets scouted you have the choice to fall out of the all in and play macro instead.

The zealot/stalker poke at the beginning this time is more to focus down queens than anything else, even if you get the health on it low that's better than nothing because the plan is to follow up directly after with the oracle. An oracle beats a queen one on one, however it will have low health, so if you can lower the queens health initially you can snipe it very quickly with the oracle after and get some juicy drone kills. Or best case scenario you actually kill the queen with the zealot/stalker and you just get a crap ton of drone kills.

This part is quite micro intensive so I would suggest practicing the timings of this build vs the AI multiple times first so you can get the timings for all the gateways down. However the follow up is extremely simple and doesn't require too much explanation.

It's been done before but recently it's become very popular in Korea. So the idea behind this is that you get the best of both worlds. You get a very fast nexus for early eco as well as a fast gateway for early tech. Soit's basically like a gate FE combined with a nexus first. If you notice they're going for anearly poolthen you can justchrono zealots and do a kind of delayed gate FEand be fine, and if not then you just continue as normal being nice and greedy with your early nexus and tech.

After the opening then it's a super safe build since you get early sentries and 2 gates to wall off. You shouldn't really lose to any thing once you get the wall up. You then transition into a few more sentries and gates while taking a 3rd and youpressure him with sentry stalker. This part of the build is very similar to the old PartinG fake 3 base 7 gate build, however you're still macroing behind it.

The goal with this attack is to justforce units and make him think you're all inning(which you aren't) and if you catch him off guard you can definitely kill the 3rd. It's just to set up for the next attack that comes.

Transition to mid game

The transition is quite simple and the "in" thing to do right now. You simplyget +2 and blink and then attack. Basically every Korean protoss is doing this right now and it's winning games left and right. There's not really a good answer to this for zerg other than getting vipers which are easily dealt with by high templar. So with a critical mass of blink/sentry you can cut up roach/hydra indefinitely and you should be able to win whatever fight. It's also great for cutting up small spaces so you can snipe hatches better.

Whatever damage you did with the first push should give you a timing to hit with the 2nd push. So long as youdon't over commit and lose more than you should(recall when you think you're starting to lose too much) you should be in good shape.If they're super preparedthen you simplyuse the 2nd push as a pokeand threaten to kill him while you're simply macroing up on 3 bases going into templar tech and harassing with the warp prism.

This 12 Roach Rush is a timing attack designed to cripple a Terran economy, transitioning into a further all-in or macro play as needed.

Scouting

There is only minor scouting necessary with this build before you hit your opponent with your 12 Roaches. Simply ensure that your opponent is not cheesing you with an 8-8-8 opener or proxy 11/11 Rax.
Once you are committed in the attack, be on the look-out for signs that your opponent is going for a full-on macro play (3 Command Centers), some sort of Hellbat aggression (Armory), some sort of Banshee play (Techlabbed Starport), or normal Bio play (multiple Barracks). Your upcoming transition requires you to both do some damage and later handle any counter attack potential from your opponent without losing much yourself.

Transitions

Depending on what you are most comfortable with and what you scout your opponent doing, you can transition into a later all-in or macro play yourself. Note that regardless of whichever path you follow, you will have to do some amount of damage with your attack or you will be behind both in terms of economy and tech.
If you are transitioning into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk play, stop all Roach production, and get a Lair, Metabolic Boost, and 2 Evolution Chambers as soon as possible. Getting Mutalisks out to defend 3 bases from drops as you tech towards +2/+2 Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk with all the necessary upgrades is how you?ll get ahead in the midgame.
If you are transitioning into a Roach based midgame, try to avoid making many more Roaches after your initial 12 roach opener. Instead, focus on securing 3 Hatcheries, 2 Evolution Chambers, and teching for a Speed Roach/Speed Hydra midgame (with potentially Swarm Host/Viper lategame).
If you are transitioning into another all-in, your best best is some sort of Roach based army with splash damage (such as a Roach/Bane all-in). Do note that any follow-up all-in will be particularly weak against Banshee or Widow Mine defenses.

Tips

- As you get to your first 100 Gas, if there is still a scout in your main base, consider fake researching Metabolic Boost. Be sure to cancel if before you get to 28 supply and need to start your Roach Warren.
- Don?t over-commit to making Roaches. Only make 12 and then be sure you are getting the necessary 2 base economy, Overlord count, and creep spread back at home while your attack is commencing.
- The point of the attack is to cripple your opponent, but if the attack does not go too well, there is no retreat; your follow-up depends largely on your ability to scout what your opponent has opened with and react/defend accordingly.

Pros and Cons

This aggressive build can outright defeat opponents that are macroing too hard or do not scout and react adequately. Opening with 12 Roaches gives your early game a muscle that not many other ZvT builds give you, giving you great denial of any Reaper/Hellion openers as well.
However, this build does put you behind both in terms of economy and tech if your attack does not do damage.

You then go up to 10 gates in total (4 starting, 2 at 3rd, 4 at 10:00) and a robo to round out your composition. The oracle should keep him back for a bit in the early game as well as give you enough information to know exactly what kind of follow up he is going for. The 4gates before 3rd and 6 sentries off of them will give you a nice defense vs early roach and or ling play to try and cancel your 3rd. Sometimes you'll have to give it up, however with the proper response (shown in one of the linked VODs) you can still end up winning.

The cool thing about this build is how versatile it is. Like I said, it has early pressure (which most fast +2 blink builds don't) while still being able to defend at home with sentries.

It' requires some decent multitasking as well as a good understanding on how to play the mass harass style vs swarm hosts.

Otherwise if they just kind of sit back and macro in a non swarm host way, then you just do some harass with the blink/sentry squad and warp prisms while going up to colossi anyway.

Back home herO goes for 2 more gates for even more aggression once warp gate is done (and ends up winning the game with it) as well as a robo for protection vs DTs and for a stable follow up if the 3gate follow up does not kill him.

The reason for robo over anything else is because:

He saw a twilight council so the threat of DTs is there. Also his twilight would be too late for blink vs blink so going for immortals is safer.Stargate always has the possibility of losing to DT and blink (especially since blink is so common now and a common follow up to a held proxy)DT is too easily expected after a failed proxy

So robo is the safest option. If you scout certain things like a stargate or robo then going for blink or oracle respectively will obviously be good in those situations.

First, SCV scout, 15 supply at the latest, to see if you are being 10 gate Zealot rushed. Then follow up with your Reaper scout, checking pylon count, assimilator count, gas mined, and MSC/Stalker/Nexus timing.

Your early Engineering Bay allows for equally early Missile Turrets, so you should be able to build a turret in your main base and position marines in your natural mineral line in the event of an Oracle attack.

Against a delayed Protoss expansion (4:10+, no Nexus), always build a bunker.

Against a fast expanding Protoss, poke with your first Marauder and 8-10 Marines to force overcharge and to gauge his army size.

This initial poke will reveal the following possibilities:

- Little to no Gateway units: Possible double forge (proceed as normal) or Dark Templars (build turrets and bank one scan minimum).
- No obvious Observers: Confirm Twilight tech. If your opponent is going for Templar instead of Colossus, immediately abandon the build and do a biomine parade style using a reactored Factory and five barracks before your third Command Center. SCV pulls are a poor choice against Pisonic Storm.
- More Stalkers then usual: Possible Blink Stalker aggression. React accordingly with bunkers and mines. Consider hiding your small poke squad at his third or fourth, and counter attacking when he moves all his stalkers and his MSC to your side of the map.
- Phoenixes: Phoenix Colossus is by far the most likely choice, but constantly scout to see if the Colossus count is rising. If it remains at one or two for very long, be cognizant of the possibility of a feint into Templars.
- Healthy Gateway unit count: Proceed as normal.

These above are only a few examples, but the most common. Against most styles that involve Colossus (single forge, double forge, blink colossus, phoenix colossus, etc) you will be able to simply play as normal and execute the all in without any problems.

For lower level players, please be advised all scouting reactions as written above are general assumptions made against players attempting optimal strategies. You will be blindsided by sub optimal and often illogical strategies quite often, but you should be able to compensate with superior macro and mechanics.

Transitions

As with any all-in, there is no transition unless you have done a significant amount of damage.

If your attack fails, there is no transition; you will die almost immediately to any counter attack, or you will be contained to two bases and slowly starve to death.

If your attack succeeds in mostly destroying Protosss army, but you cannot finish off your opponent, retreat and rally defensively. Continue your upgrades, maintain consistent worker production, and add a third command center and a Ghost Academy, if necessary.

Tips

The main objective of this push is to successfully engage and destroy his army decisively. Your SCVS are there to absorb just enough Colossus volleys to allow your Vikings to destroy all the AOE and your MMM to shoot through the Gateway buffer.

Again, to emphasize, your objective is to destroy his army decisively, not to destroy his third, or his natural, or snipe any tech. You are to take one crushing victory with your army before beginning to do any eco or tech damage.

During the actual engagement, be sure to have your SCVs in front of your main army. Attack in as wide of a concave as you can form, and make sure that your Vikings are shift A-clicked across his Colossus.

Do not attempt any drops or secondary attacks. Your attack needs to be as strong as possible along a single front for the highest chance of success.

Pros and Cons

The first ten minutes of this build, as mentioned above, are identical to a standard Reaper FE, making this a particularly tricky all in to scout. Additionally, this build has the benefit of blind countering some two base Colossus all-ins because it gets Vikings so quickly, and in such high numbers.

That being said, just as with any all-in, if scouted and identified, this build loses a lot of its potency. A faster than normal Templar transition and increased Sentries for force fields are both popular and effective responses against scouted SCV pulls.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,EngineeringBay,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,SCV,Barracks,SCV,DoubleMarines,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SCV,CallMule,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,TechLabOnBarracks,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,StimPack,Marauder,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,Factory,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marauder,CallMule,SCV,SCV,InfantryArmorLevel1,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Starport,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnFactory,DoubleMarines,Marauder,SCV,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SupplyDepot,Refinery,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,CombatShield,SupplyDepot,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMarines,CallMule,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,Armory,CallMule,Barracks,Barracks,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,ConcussiveShells,SCV,SCV,CallMule,TechLabOnBarracks,ReactorOnBarracks,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,InfantryWeaponsLevel2,SupplyDepot,CallMule,Marauder,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleVikings,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,Marauder,Starport,CallMule,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleVikings,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,CallMule,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Viking,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleVikings,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,CallMule,Marauder,Marauder,Viking,DoubleVikings', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:38 PM;

Then it follows up with a quick 3rd Command Center to get a leg up against a macro-oriented Protoss opponent.

Scouting

This macro build is a greedy build, so scouting for all-ins is important.  However, you cannot afford to (nor have any need to) scout with an SCV before 17 supply. When you get to your opponents base, check whether they have a natural expansion started at or before the 5 minute mark. If your opponent has not started a Nexus by around the 5 minute mark, and they have both gas geysers, then you can assume they are performing an all-in with either a Twilight Council or Stargate. Be prepared to delay your 3rd Command Center in favor of 2 more Bunkers at the front (or main if your opponent appears to be doing a Blink all-in) and/or a Turret per mineral line to deal with Oracles.

All of the midgame scouting will come from you pushing out and taking the middle watchtowers, attacking the front, and dropping the main once you have Medivacs out. Simply noticing what units and unit composition your opponent is using to defend should give you enough information about their midgame plans to make informed counters.

Transitions

Because of how much infrastructure and time has been spent on Bio play in this build, the only possible follow up is going for more Bio play and adding in Vikings+Ghosts (and Hellbats or Widow Mines for the late game) as you take more bases.

To transition into standard Bio play, get another Engineering Bay and an Armory to continue double upgrades, add-on a Reactor and Tech lab onto your 4th/5th Barracks, get all of your third bases Refineries, and throw down either a Ghost Academy or a 2nd Starport depending on whether your opponent is going for Colossi or High Templar.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong build because of the powerful economy you kick start with your initial CC First and quick third. Also, by avoiding early Widow Mine drops or harassing units and focusing completely on getting upgrades and Bio, your army is considerably stronger at the 10 minute mark than most other TvP builds. Finally, this build is strong because you get a fast Engineering Bay and excess minerals, and thus have the opportunity to throw down Bunkers/Turrets to deal with any sort of 1 base aggression that a Protoss player can throw at you.

However, this build is only safe if your scouting is effective. Misjudging that your opponent is going for a macro game instead of an all-in can cost you the game instantly. Also, there is no opportunity with this build to apply pressure before you finish Stim and Medivacs at the 10 minute mark because it is focused on economy instead of pressure.

Tips

- The main strength of this build is the economic advantage. Do NOT miss SCVs as you are taking bases and macroing up.
- You cannot afford to scout before 17 supply in order to afford the CC and Barracks on time, but scouting what your opponent is doing in the early game is crucial, so be sure to send an SCV to scout soon after you reach 17 supply.
- Build another Bunker or two at the front if a scan or your SCV scout finds that your opponent has not started an expansion around the 5 minute mark.
- If you are playing completely blind, build a Missile Turret in each mineral line to defend against the possibility of Oracles before they could possibly arrive.
- Once you have Stimpack and Medivacs, push out instantly to try and deny a third base from your opponent and/or get scouting information about what midgame tech choice your opponent is committing to. However, keep in mind that you are on 3 Orbitals, and so remember that your economy is far ahead, but your army supply is not.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'INnoVation Reactor Hellion 3CC', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This CC First build gets a ridiculously fast 3rd Command Center, taking your economy immediately into the midgame. Using Reactor Hellions for map control and scouting information, this build is also reasonably safe; your Hellions let you quickly react to any Zerg all-in and Widow Mines + 3 Orbitals provides a reasonable defense.

Scouting

Instead of worrying about early game Zerglings, Innovation just builds his Command Center on the high ground, and finishes a wall-off with the initial Barracks. Thus, Innovation does not scout at all until his first Hellions pop.  With these Reactor Hellions he takes map control, clears out any Zerglings at watchtowers, and pokes Zergs front to spot the Zergs third base, any buildings at the front, and any units that Zerg is making.

- If you see a ton of Speedlings, then make sure your Hellion micro is on point. Feel free to pull back behind your natural wall in order to more effectively deal with Speedlings.
- If you see Roaches, then immediately cut Reactor Hellion production and start making Widow Mines two at a time. Make a Marauder, and consider cutting SCVs in order to complete a wall-off at your natural and prevent your opponent from running past your Bunker/Widow Mines.
- If you see two Evolution Chambers, then assume your opponent is playing a macro game.
- Alternatively, if you see a third base, then you can also assume your opponent is playing a macro game.

After any early pressure is spotted or not spotted, lift off your third Command Center and take your third. Use your Hellions and Marines (now with Stim) to secure it. All mid-game scouting will come from your incoming push with your first Medivacs.

Transitions

This build transitions well into both Marine/Tank or Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine because it sets up the basic infrastructure needed for either of those and gets Stim, +1/+1, and Combat Shields. Its infeasible to transition into Mech because of how much infrastructure and time you have already committed to into Bio upgrades.

For either transition, secure your third base, take both Refineries at your third, start +2/+2, and produce a lot of Marines. When transitioning into Marine/Tank, start a Tech lab on your Factory as well as a second Factory to kick start your Siege Tank count. When transitioning into Bio/Widow Mine, produce a Reactor on your Factory and start cranking out Widow Mines as you abuse your mobile Marine/Medivac force to apply pressure to your opponent. A +2/+2 timing attack with several Siege Tanks or several Widow Mines, and a lot of Marines is a very strong timing to hit.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a ridiculously economic opener  CC First into 3 CC.  However, this build gets Reactored Hellions quite quickly in order to take map control as well as stay safe against early Speedling timings. Also, your Hellions are quite useful in terms of the scouting information they give you.

Since the ramp is so small you can easily forcefield it off and be slightly greedier with your opening (so long as your reaction times are good) and the phoenix cater to the large amount of drop area.

The build opens with a standard oracle for some harassment and scouting. Very normal and cool. It goes into a fast 5 phoenix after the oracle to further harass (if you want to reveal them) and also shut down drops early on to keep you safe to tech up to templar. HerO does both. I've seen him reveal them after 3 to start doing some harassment with the oracle (usually if they open delayed mines so you can pick up the mines and continue harassing) or he will keep them hidden like vs Polt (someone he knows loves his drops) so you can catch some medivacs for free.

After that you go into charge and an archon or two to get your 3rd up. This is going to be the hard part to stay stabilized. This is when terran will try to really pressure you to keep you off 3 bases and away from storm. This is why HerO gets a decent gateway count before taking the 3rd as you will need as many units as possible to keep them away and your 3rd safe.

Once the 3rd is set and you have storm you should have a decent time keeping terran back as you try a storm drop or two while you tech up to colossi as well to abuse any lack of vikings. I prefer to add a 2nd robo as well when the colossi tech up starts so that way you can really hit with a hard transition of suddenly 2 and suddenly 4 colossi instead of just getting one and slowly go up. It's much easier for terran to transition himself when you only do 1 colossus at a time so if you do double robo you can open a timing window for yourself if the terran isn't scouting/reacting properly.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Hero Aggresive Stargate', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Gateway Expand and then transitions into light Gateway pressure in order to start the macro game with an economic advantage. Also, this build gets both a Stargate and a third base quite quickly for a Chargelot/Void Ray or pure Sky-toss unit composition in the late game.

Scouting

After the early game, be sure to scout for early Roaches from your opponent. If your opponent is performing an early 2 base all-in, then warp-in Sentries and make Void Rays from your Stargate instead of being aggressive with your initial 6 units. If your opponent has taken a third base or shows NO signs of aggression, then be sure to set up your proxy Pylon as soon as you can for the attack to hit before Zergling Speed can finish.

When you are attacking with your initial 6 units (2 Stalkers, 3 Zealots, and Mothership Core), your opponent must defend with whatever units he has. With this extra scouting information, be sure to react appropriately. If your opponent has opened with Roaches, then be sure to start Void Ray production earlier. If your opponent has opened without Zergling speed, then be sure to continue the 3gate attack, reinforcing with Zealots and Stargate units when you can. If your opponent has opened with Zergling speed, then be sure not to over-commit to the attack; rather, pull back and start your Stargate production appropriately. Also note that if you kill a Queen or two, you should reinforce with an Oracle first due to your opponent?s lack of anti-air.

Depending on how your attack has gone (especially if your opponent defended with opening fast Roaches), then you might not feel safe to take such a quick third Nexus. Instead, start a Forge and a few Cannons at your natural in order to play safe.

Transitions

This build is a macro build, so don?t commit multiple warp-ins to the initial 3gate attack unless you are confident in its success. Following up with the appropriate Stargate units and taking your 3rd Nexus/extra Assimilators is much more important than dealing a killing blow with these units.

HerO follows up this attack with a Forge and several Cannons at both his natural expansion and 3rd Nexus. He then starts 2 more Stargates and both Assimilators at his 3rd Nexus in order to make a mass Void Ray army. With his economic advantage, he ensures that no standard Roach/Hydra timing attacks can kill his Sky-toss army until it is already too powerful.

However, it is also possible to play with an sOs style transition, favoring mass Chargelot and only several Void Rays in order to make a beefier ground army.  Again, start a Forge (or two) for Cannons at the natural expansion and 3rd Nexus as well as for Ground Upgrades. Then start at least 4 Gateways for a healthy Gateway count and a Twilight Council to begin Zealot Charge before taking your 5th and 6th Assimilators at your 3rd Nexus.  Add in High Templar/Archons instead of more Void Rays as your gas count allows it.

Tips

- Because this is a macro build with only light pressure, commit almost all of your chronoboost on both your Nexus throughout the build.
- With your initial Stalkers, be sure to clear any stray Zerglings around your base that might scout your build. Then defend the building proxy Pylon until your first warp-in.
- As soon as you start your Stargate, you need to send out a Probe in order to set up an aggressive proxy Pylon
- During your 3gate attack, use your Stalkers to target-fire any Queens your opponent might use to defend with. If you can kill a Queen or two, then follow-up with an Oracle to deal a lot of damage. Also, be sure to use Time Warp on any Queens or Roaches so as to minimize your opponent?s mobility in the fight.
- Do NOT over-commit multiple warp-ins to the 3gate attack unless you are confident that you can do damage. Each warp-in that you use slows down your 3rd Nexus timing by at least 20 seconds.
- If your opponent defends with fast Roaches, then consider starting a Forge and several Cannons at your natural expansion before you take the 3rd Nexus.

Pros and Cons

This macro build is strong because it opens with some light aggression for harassment and scouting, while taking a rather quick 3rd Nexus behind it. Also, it is a safe Gateway Expand build because your 3gates and Stargate together are enough to defend most early Zerg all-ins. Finally, this build uses a Stargate for some decent harassment, a deterrent for Mutalisks, and an opening for a strong unit-composition in the midgame.

However, this build requires solid macro while simultaneously performing a timing attack, so may be quite hard for newer players. Also, this build is somewhat weak against a Zerg who takes minimal losses during the 3gate attack and is able to follow-up with a +1/+1 mass Speedling attack to kill your 3rd Nexus.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Nexus,MothershipCore,WarpgateUpgrade,Pylon,Stalker,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Stargate,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Phoenix,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,VoidRay,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Nexus', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:38 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Jaedong 3 base Ling-Hydra', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This 3 Hatchery opening transitions into a strong Speedling/Hydralisk timing to hit the third base of Protoss before its economy can kick in. It then tech switches instantly into Spire or Roach/Hydra/Viper play to best counter the unit composition Protoss has used to defend the pressure.

Scouting

Once you are into the midgame, all of your scouting will come from what your opponent hits you with, and then later your Ling/Hydra timing attack. Assuming your opponent has opened with Stargate play, you will either see Phoenix harassing your Overlords/Drones or a Void Ray for defense while your opponent tries to take a third. As soon as you have confirmed your opponent going for Stargate play (either with an early Overlord scout or by any of the above cues), you can choose to go through with this build.
When you are attacking your opponent?s third base with your Ling/Hydra timing, be sure to note your opponent?s unit composition. Against Colossus play, throw down a Spire. Against Stargate play, keep making Hydralisks. Against Blink play or a strong ground army, transition into Roach/Hydra/Viper play or continue with a Ling/Hydra unit composition and +2/+2 upgrades.

Transitions

This build is designed to tech switch as soon as you spot the unit composition of your opponent, so it has quite a few transitions. In all cases, as you are moving out with the Ling/Hydra timing attack, be sure to start your 4th Hatchery.
If your Ling/Hydra timing runs into a Colossus, start a Spire and take 2 more Extractors at your 4th Hatchery. Go for a hard Mutalisk switch to catch your opponent off-guard and keep applying pressure/harassing your opponent?s Probes, while you take the map and transition into the late game. Killing off any Phoenix during your Ling/Hydra timing will strengthen this transition dramatically. Going for a Hive instantly and getting Vipers can be strong against Colossus play too.
If your Ling/Hydra timing runs into a Chargelot/Void Ray or pure Skytoss unit composition, then be sure to keep making Drones and out-expand your opponent OR keep committing to the fight by rallying more and more Hydralisks and Speedlings in an attempt to break your opponent. If you choose to macro and out-expand your opponent, a Roach/Hydra/Viper unit composition with 2 Evolution Chambers is quite standard ? so start +2/+2 Missile upgrades and Hive tech as soon as you can.

Tips

- If your first Overlord scouts your opponent going for a Gateway expand, then you should abandon getting the third base, instead getting an Extractor and starting Metabolic Boost before taking your 3rd.
- Also, if you feel unsafe opening with a Hatchery First against a Forge First Fast Expand, then feel free to open with a Pool First into 3 Hatchery Opener and transition into this build in exactly the same manner.
- If your natural gets Pylon blocked, then you can make an early Overlord at 15 supply instead of the Hatchery in order to buy some time against it. If your opponent lets the Pylon finish, then simply making 4-6 Zerglings to take the Pylon down should be enough of a commitment before returning back to the build.
- Being thorough about checking for early proxy Pylons across the map with your early game Zerglings is crucial against early Protoss timings. Being able to spot aggression and stop it before it can even begin is the easiest way to avoid quick losses.
- There is no need for a Roach Warren if you spot your opponent going for a Forge Fast Expand into Phoenix build, as Jaedong scouts when beating Dear at the WCS Finals.
- During the Ling/Hydra timing, be sure not to fight in a choke where force fields will split your Zerglings from Hydralisks.
- During the Ling/Hydra timing, spread your army to help reduce Colossus splash damage. Target firing any Colossus or getting on top of the Robotics Facility is a great way to perform game-ending damage.
- Start your 4th Hatchery before the fight so that your transition is backed with maximal economy.  Perform the tech switch reacting to your opponent?s unit composition as soon as you can.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a hugely economic opening in order to fund a 3 Base Ling/Hydra timing to crush your opponent?s 3rd Nexus. It also does not commit much to the attack, allowing you to tech switch instantly and counter the unit composition your opponent has chosen to defend their third with.
However, this build is weak to early pressure, for you skip the Roach Warren for safety against early 2 base Protoss attacks. Also, because this build opens with a gasless 3 Hatchery opener, you should only be performing this build against Forge Fast Expanding players.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Queen,Zergling,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Queen,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,MetabolicBoost,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Drone,EvolutionChamber,EvolutionChamber,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,MeleeAttacksLevel1,MissleAttacksLevel1,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Lair,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,SporeCrawler,SporeCrawler,SporeCrawler,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,HydraliskDen,HydraliskDen,Overseer,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GroovedSpines,MuscularAugments,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,InjectLarva,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hatchery,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:38 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'HyuN Roach-Hydra-Viper', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This macro build order opens with a quick 3 Hatchery opening to get a strong economy and then transitions into a Tech-heavy army in order to stay safe against early attacks and lay on the aggression to Protoss before the late game starts. This build maxes out on Roach/Hydra/Viper in order to crush your opponent?s army or deny their 3rd/4th base.

Scouting

Scout with either Overlords, Zerglings, Overseer, or Changelings when your Hydralisk Den goes down. Send them into either the main base or the 3rd base in order to see if Protoss is going for a tech-heavy composition (Colossus/Void Ray/etc) or a Chargelot-heavy composition. If they are going for a Chargelot heavy composition, instantly throw down a Banelings Nest, start Baneling Speed, and max out with around 16 Banelings in your unit composition.
Besides this, all mid and late game scouting comes from the Roach/Hydra/Viper pokes or attacks that you will perform. React appropriately by either re-maxing with Ultras or Swarm Hosts. You will need a 5th base to fully support any Hive-tech re-maxes.

Transitions

There is no ?transition? per se. If you can win the game with this push, then be sure to attack in an open position, use Blinding Cloud or Abduct appropriately, and take the game quickly. If you cannot win the game outright, then fall back on your 4/5 base economy and tech switch to whatever best counters your opponent?s army. Note that you should get a lot of static defense in order to stay safe during your super late game tech switches between Mutalisks, Swarm Hosts, and Ultralisks.

Tips

- If your first Overlord scouts your opponent going for a Gateway expand, then you should abandon getting the third base, instead getting an Extractor and starting Metabolic Boost before taking your 3rd.
- If your natural gets Pylon blocked, then you can make an early Overlord at 15 supply instead of the Hatchery in order to buy some time against it. If your opponent lets the Pylon finish, then simply making 4-6 Zerglings to take the Pylon down should be enough of a commitment before returning back to the build.
- Being thorough about checking for early proxy Pylons across the map with your early game Zerglings is crucial against early Protoss timings. Being able to spot aggression and stop it before it can even begin is the easiest way to avoid quick losses.
- Be sure you send in an Overlord scout at 7:00. Spotting your opponent?s midgame tech informs your next step with this build(whether it be more Drones, a Hydralisk Den, or Spore Crawlers).
- Vipers will be usable (Consume finishes) 3:30 after your Infestation Pit starts.
- Scouting for a heavy Chargelot composition before you max can be quite important. Throwing down a Banelings Nest and maxing with several Banelings can be the difference between a quick loss and a sure win.
- Once you have re-maxed on Ultras, starting a Spire and tech-switching between Mutalisks and Swarm Hosts/Ultras is a strong way to win in the very late game. Also note that you should get a lot of static defense when performing these late game tech switches.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a hugely economic opening while still being safe. It then transitions into a Viper-based defense in order to secure your 4th base and quickly max out on Roach/Hydra/Viper.
This build however requires constant scouting in order to be safe.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Jaedong Roach Drop Nydus All-In', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This all-in hits your opponent?s main with a lot of speed Roaches. However, Jaedong puts his own clever flair on this traditional ZvT All-in by using an Overlord Roach Drop to guarantee his Nydus follow-up is successful.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of very early force, position your Queens to defend your natural and consider getting a Spine Crawler. Banshee play may be an issue with only 2 Queens, but such a fast Lair means you will have a very quick Overseer.
The next scout will be with your initial Roach Warren attack. Terran will be forced to defend his main with all his units, so you?ll see either Bio or Mech units to defend. These Roaches should be able to scout and do some serious economic damage ? hopefully enough to end the game with constant reinforcements from the Nydus Network.

Transitions

This build is a 2 base all-in that gets a lot of attacking units and very few Drones as well as upgrades that do not lend themselves towards the mid or late game. Therefore, there is no well-defined follow-up for the build, should your attack fail. However, if you do a lot of damage with the attack but lose your Nydus Network, be sure to follow-up with a 3rd Hatchery, a lot more Drones, and 2 Evolution Chambers to try to transition into normal play.

Tips

- Against a Reaper/Hellion player, save your Queen energy after you start 2 or 3 Creep Tumors. Having energy for Transfuse lets you push back any early attacks without revealing your Roaches.
- Hide your Roaches for as long as possible before you move out. The less time you give your opponent to react to your build, the better your chance at crushing through their front.
- Make 2 Overlords per inject cycle ? 8 Roaches takes up 16 supply.
- Bring an Overseer or two with your Roach attack so that you have detection against Widow Mines. Remember to split your Roaches to avoid splash damage from either Widow Mines or Siege Tanks.
- This attack is an all-in, so you have to kill your opponent with this attack. Don?t let your Roaches mess around attacking buildings or SCVs ? kill your opponent?s army as soon as possible.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any player going for a fast 3 Command Center build (the current metagame) because of how late their upgrades and army will be. Also, any build that gets both Roach drops AND Nydus Networks is a very fun all-in to play with.
However, this is an all-in, so if you cannot do game-ending damage with the Roach attack, you will be economically behind the Terran opponent.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,MetabolicBoost,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Overlord,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Lair,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,RoachWarren,Drone,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,VentralSacs,Overlord,Overlord,GlialReconstitution,PneumatizedCarapace,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,NydusNetwork,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,NydusWorm', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:38 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Jaedong 9 Pool', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a 9 Pool in order to apply a lot of early pressure to your opponent and keep them on one base, and then transitions into more macro oriented play with a Speedling follow-up.

Scouting

All of your scouting comes from your initial Overlords and your 10 Zerglings.  First scout where your opponent has spawned by sending your Overlord directly to one of the possible bases. Then use your first 6 Zerglings (with more rallied) to poke/prod your opponent?s base.
If you see your opponent?s natural Hatchery nearly done, then they have performed a Hatchery First opener and you can choose either to ignore the natural and attack their workers in the main or to focus exclusively on the natural and plan to bring it down. Note that you MUST do economic damage one way or another with your 10 Zerglings or you will fall behind economically.
If your opponent?s natural Hatchery is only just started, then they have performed a Pool First opener. Focus on canceling the natural Hatchery ? you won?t be able to do much damage in the main before their Spawning Pool finishes.
If your opponent does not have a natural, then go up into the main and check their gas count. Prepare against 1 base play of either Banelings or Roaches by focusing much more on Speedlings and potentially getting a Spine Crawler.

Transitions

You can use this opener to transition into any form of Zerg play. If you want to end the game immediately, you can put Drones back on gas and go for a 1 base Ling/Bane all-in.
More standard play ensues by starting your natural expansion as soon as possible and making only as many Speedlings as needed to be safe and have map control. For a Roach midgame, start a Roach Warren and Lair after your first 100 gas. Then, on 3 gasses, you can start Roach Speed and +1 Attack. For a Mutalisk midgame, get a Lair with your first 100 gas and saturate your 2 bases and 4 gasses as soon as possible. Start your Spire as soon as your Lair finishes.

Tips

- Attack his Drones in his main if he has performed a Hatchery First opener
- Attack his natural expansion if he has gone for a Pool First opener
- Scout his main if he has gone for a 1 base build
- Do NOT make too many Zerglings. It may seem tempting to try and kill your opponent with constant reinforcements, but slow Zerglings lose their effectiveness very quickly. Drones are much more important.
- Be sure to pull off of gas once you have mined 100 for Metabolic Boost. You need all of your Drones mining minerals in order to boost your economy into the midgame.

Pros and Cons

This build opens up with a 9 Pool in order to situate aggressively in a matchup known for its early game volatility. It also gets Metabolic Boost at a standard time, while still allowing for both macro or all-in transitions.
However, this build is obviously a lot less economical than most other ZvZ builds, so you must do some sort of economic damage with your initial 10 Zerglings or risk falling behind.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,CancelExtractor,Drone,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Queen,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,MetabolicBoost,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Overlord,InjectLarva', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:38 PM;

This build opens with 5 Stalkers to apply pressure to your opponent and scout for what they?re opening.  It then follows up with a Stargate Expand, allowing you to reactively counter your opponent?s opening tech.

Benchmark: When you Stargate finishes (@6:30ish), you should have 24 Probes, 5 Stalkers, and a Mothership Core.

Scouting

Because of how low on minerals you are, you cannot afford to Probe scout.Thus, all of your scouting comes from your Stalkers.

Being active with your initial 3 Stalkers around your natural, third, and watchtower will prevent your opponent from sneaking proxy Pylons past you and hitting you with a very fast Gateway unit attack. Also, with your mobile army, you can head directly at your opponent in order to scout what units they have made and even attack them if they are attempting to expand quickly.  Your 5 Stalkers (with high ground vision from your Mothership Core) must scout what your opponent is doing, so that you can react accordingly with your Stargate in the midgame.

- If your opponent is fast expanding, then produce an Oracle from your Stargate and attempt to pressure the front with your Stalkers as your Oracle does damage in the main.
- If your opponent has multiple Sentries out, then attempt to bust up the ramp with your Stalkers to force him to use Force Fields to defend his ramp. The most likely scenario is that your opponent is making a Robotics Facility behind their Sentry count. However, it is also possible that your opponent is making a Stargate instead.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then make an Oracle or two and keep them in their base by threatening to kill multiple workers if they leave.
- If your opponent has a Stargate of their own, make constant Phoenix and position your units very defensively to deal with early Oracles.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then make one Oracle to stay defensive with in case of DTs. Afterwards, you can make up to 3-4 Phoenix for map control and harass potential, but quickly transition into Void Ray/Immortal to stay safe against Blink play.

Transitions

This build transitions into a macro game very easily. However, the actual unit composition of that macro game very often depends completely on what build your opponent has chosen to open with. If your opponent stays on one base for too long, then throw down more Gateways, constantly make units, and prepare to defend your natural with Void Rays, Stalkers, (possibly Immortals), and your Planetary Nexus. In Stargate vs Stargate macro games, quickly go up to 2 Stargates constantly making Phoenix and get a Fleet Beacon for the Phoenix Range upgrade. In Stargate vs Robotics macro games, use your Phoenix or Oracles to get an economic advantage, while transitioning into Sky-toss or a Phoenix/Blink all-in. In Stargate vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponent?s potential Blink or Dark Templar harass, as you transition to Void Ray/Immortal for defense or pure Sky-toss.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very safe build that gets quick map control with 5 Stalkers early on for safety, aggression, and scouting. With accurate scouting information, it then transitions into Stargate play and expands so that you can play a reactive macro game with a strong economy.

When you are out on the map with your first Stalkers, however, your opponent might sneak an Oracle into your main base. Be careful that you are only aggressive when you can be aggressive and only use your Stalkers for scouting when you cannot be aggressive.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Jim 1 gate FE to Phoenix-Colossus', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a fast expansion in order to get an economic advantage, using an Oracle for harass potential and defense until you can setup a Phoenix/Colossus midgame unit composition.

Benchmark: When your Robotics Facility finishes (@7:00ish), you should have 1 Oracle, 1 Stalker, 1 Sentry, a Mothership Core, and around 37 Probes.

Benchmark: When your 2nd Colossus finishes (@10:00ish), you should have 2 Colossi, 3 Phoenix, 1 Stalker, 3 Zealots, 2 Sentries, and a Mothership Core with over 50 Probes.

Scouting

Feel free to Probe scout after you build your Gateway in order to determine what your opponent is building. The majority of information about what Terran is doing however will come from what your opponent hits you with.  If you spot a Reaper coming into your base, then try and stop it from seeing your building Stargate with your Stalker and Mothership Core (do not worry too much if it is spotted however, for your Stargate is only initially being used for one Oracle). If you do not spot a Reaper, then send your Mothership Core and use its huge sight range to spot what buildings your opponent has inside of his base before returning home.

The majority of your midgame scouting will come from your Oracle. Use it to spot whether your opponent is opening with Bio, going for fast upgrades, fast triple Command Center, or strong 2 base timing. If you see an opening, then the Oracle can be used to harass your opponent?s SCVs, but the true purpose of the Oracle is constant scouting through the midgame. Your opponent?s 3rd base timing is especially useful as a good benchmark for when you should try and take your 3rd base.

Transitions

The build transitions into a Phoenix/Colossus midgame, with a standard Colossus/High Templar/Archon late game. As soon as you spot your opponent taking his 3rd base, secure a third of your own, then start 2 Forges and several more Gateways. Keep producing Phoenix and Colossus until you have around 7 of each (7 is a LOT for a normal game, but the heavily delayed High Templar tech means that you have a stronger army in the midgame), supplementing your army with Zealots when you have extra minerals. Finally, when your +1/+1 is halfway done, be sure to start a Twilight Council for +2/+2, Zealot Charge, and Templar Archives in order to reach your lategame army.

Tips

- In the early game, you are attempting to get your economy up enough to support Phoenix/Colossus on 2 bases.  Be sure to chronoboost your Probes constantly until you need to divert chronoboost to your Robotics Facility/Stargate.
- Against Reaper play, position your initial Stalker and Mothership Core defensively.  Try to deny it scouting your Stargate, but don?t worry if it is scouted?the Stargate is only initially used for one Oracle.
- The main purpose of your initial Oracle is for scouting. While it is true that you can kill several SCVs if your opponent?s Marines are out of position, do NOT sacrifice your Oracle for a few extra kills. The constant threat of harass and ability to scout for the first 10 minutes of the game is a lot more important than an extra SCV kill or two.
- Position your Phoenix defensively outside your main (to absolutely shut down any midgame drops) up until you are ready to take your third.  If/when your Oracle dies, use your flock of Phoenix to take map control and kill several SCVs with any extra APM you have.
- Take your third base and start 2 Forges as soon as you spot your opponent taking his 3rd base.
- Build more Colossus (up to 7) than you normally would (around 4). With the extra air support tanking and killing Vikings, your Colossus count must be quite large in order to take out your opponent?s Bio army.

Pros and Cons

This build gets out an early Oracle for harass potential and constant scouting. It also gets a strong economy and uses a midgame Phoenix/Colossus unit composition to defend drops and bio pushes with ease. This midgame composition is quite robust in terms of defending your third as well as stopping constant Medivac harass.

However, this build is short on Gateway units for the early stages of the game. Thus, any early drops are quite hard to stop unless you are able to scout them beforehand and prepare appropriately. Also, you do not start your Forges until you start your third base, so you will often be behind in upgrades against a macro-Terran.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,MothershipCore,Nexus,GasProbe,GasProbe,WarpgateUpgrade,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,Probe,Stargate,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Probe,Oracle,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Observer,RoboticsBay,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Observer,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,ExtendedThermalLance,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Phoenix,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Phoenix,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Phoenix,Chronoboost', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:39 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Life Baneling Bust', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a quick 3 Hatcheries, faking as if you are going for a macro-oriented play, but then builds an overwhelmingly large swell of Zerglings and Baneling busts your opponent before they are ready.

Scouting

Use your initial 2 Zerglings to probe the front of your opponent?s natural. Assuming they don?t die, send them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or outside the front of the Terran?s base depending on the map.
Your next scout will be with your Baneling bust. Based off of how strong your opponent?s wall is, what unit composition he is using to defend, and how many SCVs you kill, react accordingly.

Transitions

While technically this build gets a third base, you are on a very low Drone count, and are spending all of your money on an early all-in that absolutely has to deal some amount of economic damage. Usually the only viable follow-up is sending wave after wave of Zerglings and Banelings in order to finish off your opponent, but if Terran has pushed you back or  over-committed to a strong wall-off, just pull back and Drone at home. Transition into standard Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk play if possible.

Tips

- While Life opens with a 15 Spawning Pool, you can perform this same build by opening with a 15 Hatchery as well.
- Hide your 2nd Extractor and Banelings Nest from areas where your opponent is likely to scout with a Reaper or Hellion.
- Morph your Banelings out of sight of your opponent?s wall-off, so your opponent does not know that you are about to hit him until your Baneling bust is already happening.
- Be sure to send your Banelings in to target down any Bunkers or Supply Depots in the wall first and then flood in with the rest of your Zerglings.
- Most of your initial army will likely die. The true win happens from your rallied army and any more Banelings you morph from it.

Pros and Cons

This build hits an early 2 Base timing when your opponent is less likely to be expecting any pressure, let alone a strong all-in. Without a strong wall-off or excellent micro, it will walk over most unsuspecting Terran players.
However, this build sacrifices a lot of economy and tech in order to fund such a huge army. Assuming your opponent holds without taking too much economic damage, your low Drone count means that you are unlikely to be able to compete with a 2 base Terran?s economy.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Overlord,Drone,Queen,Zergling,Drone,Drone,Drone,Queen,Extractor,InjectLarva,Drone,Overlord,Queen,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,MetabolicBoost,SpawnCreepTumor,Hatchery,InjectLarva,BanelingNest,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,InjectLarva,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:39 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'INnoVation Reaper-Hellion 3CC', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

Invented by Flash but refined and popularized by INnoVation, this Reaper/Hellion 3CC variant is by far the most popular on ladder and is considered by the majority of Terran players to be the most standard of macro builds. Its versatility has stood the test of time, and the current version below will be continually updated as INnoVation continues to optimize it again and again.

Scouting

You can open with this build regardless of what your opponent is doing, so SCV scouting is unnecessary. You only need to SCV scout if you want to confirm that your opponent is opening Hatchery First and want to start a Bunker at their natural in order to begin Reaper/Bunker pressure.

The rest of your scouting will come from your Reapers and then later Reaper+Hellions poking the front and forcing your opponent to reveal what units they have in order to defend your attacks. Note: Ling Speed will finish around 3 minutes after your opponent takes an Extractor. Thus, if your initial SCV/Reapers see your opponent taking gas, be sure to send your Reapers back just before those 3 minutes are up and wait for some Hellions before attempting to engage Speedlings in the open field.

In case your Reapers or Hellions spot your opponent making Roaches or going for a Roach Warren, immediately cancel your next pair of Hellions and begin making Widow Mines and Marauders. Having your Widow Mines positioned effectively, and using SCVs to tank damage or repair your Bunker will be all you need to stay alive.

Be prepared to throw the timings of the second half of this build out assuming any serious aggression, such as a Roach Bane all-in.

Transitions

This build transitions well into both Marine/Tank or Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine because it sets up the basic infrastructure needed for either of those and gets Stimpack.

The above transition involving double barracks after hellions followed by double ebay is the standard transition. In the event of an extreme all in, such as Roach bane, immediately begin marauder, mine, and bunker production. Against a strong Roach timing it is advised to begin tank production while slightly delaying either your Starport or Engineering Bays; this is most demonstrated notably in INnoVations series against Hyun in the WCS 2014 Global Finals.

Another great transition if you have done some damage with your Reapers or Hellions is going for a Hellbat/Marauder follow-up attack. How Dragon does this is throw down an Armory as soon as you start your 3rd Command Center, and then make Hellbats constantly as soon as the Armory finishes.  Starting two Engineering Bays and going for a +1/+1 Marauder/Hellbat push is a great way to keep up the aggression against your Zerg opponent. Keep in mind that this sort of 3CC Hellbat aggression is far weaker than a two base committed Hellbat push.

Pros and Cons

This build was originally intended as an aggressive opener backed by strong macro. In modern TvZ, however, any competent Zerg player will easily deflect Reaper Hellion pressure with minimal losses, and gasless three hatches are becoming increasingly rare due to the benefits provided by opening either Speedlings or Roach aggression. As such, the major pro of this build should now be listed as the amount of information that the Reaper can provide; because Zerg cannot proxy any tech, you should be aware of what Zerg is doing most of the time. In this way, opening Reaper/Hellion is inordinately safer than simply opening Hellions, if only because of the information difference.

The weakness of this build traditionally had been hyper aggressive openers, such as fast Speedling rushes (which can be deterred by bunkers between your 2nd CC and your main ramp), Roach/Bane busts (which can be held with bunkers, repair, and either mines or hellions with Marauders), or even fast Muta play (which INnoVation countered by simply pushing at his normal time with three missile turrets at home).

The new biggest threat against this build, however, is Roach timings. Simply put, this build focuses very heavily on Hellion production, and delays all other AOE quite significantly (usually up until around 11+ minutes). As such, 1-1 Roach Busts, or fast 2-2 Roach Hydra max out attacks, or even Roach Hydra into Brood Lords are all excellent examples of builds in which players should quickly identify, cut Hellions, and immediately begin adapting their builds for the situation.

Learning this Build and the Difficulty Curve

This build is undoubtedly one of the hardest macro builds to learn in the game. Besides its extreme adherence to timings and linear sequences, it is also extremely punishing in every aspect; INnoVation has refined this build to the point of impracticability; over queueing means delaying Hellions; delaying Hellions delays your Barracks, delaying your Barracks delays your starport, and delaying your starport delays your entire 1-1 push. In short, a single mistake has many more long lasting impacts as opposed to a standard Terran build.

To go about learning this build, it is important to work on only one section at a time and to not try to do everything at once when you first start off, else you will immediately fail.

In the order of things to focus on (#1 being top priority, and #8 being the lowest priority)

1. Worker Production
2. Not getting supply blocked, not over queueing, and proper rallies for all structures
3. The build itself (for example, starting Hellions before 5:30, or double E-bay and 2nd gas geyser at 7:40) and its relevant timings
4. Taking your Third base on time
5. Scouting
6. Keeping your Reaper Hellion alive
7. Harassing
8. Micro (Sniping the first creep tumor, catching the transfer of drones to the third base, weakening Queens to force transfuses and decrease tumors, sniping active tumors, runbys, etc.)

In short, always defer to the priorities, and only move down the line as you can accomplish the others. Even if you kill 32 Zerglings with your Hellions, it is irrelevant if you Medivacs finish at 12 minutes instead of 10:20. Even if you land your third base at 8:30, it is irrelevant if you only have 26 SCVs at the time instead of 40-50 that INnoVation might have. And even if you plant every structure down perfectly at the allotted times, supply blocks, over queueing, poor rallies, and suboptimal worker distribution also grind this entire build to a screeching halt.

Focus on one step at a time, and continually re watch INnoVations replays of this build from his view to fully internalize the mechanics and decisions that make this build brilliant.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,Reaper,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,CommandCenter,GasScv,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Factory,SCV,SCV,CallMule,CommandCenter,SCV,LiftRaxFromReactor,OrbitalCommand,LandFactoryOnReactor,Marine,SCV,DoubleHellions,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleHellions,StimPack,Marine,SCV,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,DoubleHellions,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnFactory,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,EngineeringBay,EngineeringBay,Refinery,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Marine,SCV,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,InfantryArmorLevel1,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,SCV,SCV,SCV,LandRaxOnReactor,LandRaxOnReactor,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Refinery,Refinery,ReactorOnFactory,Starport,SCV,SCV,SCV,CallMule,CallMule,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,ConcussiveShells,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,Armory,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Refinery', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:38 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Leenock 3 Base Ultra', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with fast upgrades and mass Speedlings to crush any midgame attacks. It then transitions into a strong 3 base Ultralisk timing to either cripple the Protoss opponent or outright win the game.

Scouting

Scout first with your 2 initial Zerglings, use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of the Protoss base depending on the map.   Check to see whether your opponent is Gateway expanding or Forge expanding. Be wary of early pressure if your opponent is Gateway expanding.
With your 7:00 overlord scout, consider adding a Baneling Nest if you are up against a Gateway timing. Make mass Speedlings to defend any 2 base ground plays or ramp up Queen production early to defend any 2 base air plays.
Against a 2 base Colossus push, consider adding a Spire for Corruptors if you need more defense. Also, regardless of whether or not you need to make Corruptors for defense, you should start Air upgrades in case of a Mutalisk switch after you have maxed out with your Ultralisk army.
Ideally, your Ultras should be out with +5/+3 around 15:50. Commit to an attack as soon as possible when these upgrades finish.  If you have yet to take a 4th base and Spire or Hydralisk Den by this stage in the game, get them now.

Transitions

There is no ?transition? per se.  If you can win the game with this push, then be sure to attack in an open position and take the game quickly. If you cannot win the game outright, then fall back on your 4 base economy and tech switch to whatever best counters your opponent?s army.

Tips

Against Pylon blocks

- If you want to try and guarantee the Hatchery being placed, send a Drone to your natural around 11/12 supply and hide it there. This might trick Protoss into thinking that you are going Pool first.  Note that this will not work every time, and it also will not stop a Protoss dedicated to Pylon blocking you.
- A 15 Pool/15 Hatch/15 Gas opener (or at worst ? if they fail to cancel the Pylon ? a 15 Pool/15 Gas/and Hatchery as soon as you can) will be fine in this case. The most important thing is starting your Extractor on time, not the natural Hatchery.
- Be sure to make 4-6 Zerglings to take the pylon down if you need to, and go up to 3 Queens as soon as you can ? just like normal.
- Once you place your Extractor, the first 100 gas goes to Metabolic Boost, and place your Evolution Chambers when you get to 175 gas like normal to transition back into the build.

The Engagement

- Bring your Queens to transfuse, and any optional Infestors or Banelings you made to force good engagements.
- Do NOT engage into a Protoss wall. You want to engage in as open an area as you possibly can for your melee army to do maximum damage.
- Do NOT engage without your queens in transfuse range unless you are sure you can take a strong fight. Strong creep spread with all of your Queens helps tremendously.
- Try to avoid Archons with your Zerglings; use the Ultralisks to tank those. Similarly, focus your Zerglings on Stalkers and Immortals; keep your Ultralisks away from those.
- If you use Ultralisks to crush any forcefields, Zerglings can actually deal with Colossi quite easily as they take minimal damage whilst underneath the Colossi.

Pros and Cons

This build is very strong against a ?standard? Protoss army of Gateway units, Colossi and some Stargate or Templar units. Also, this timing attack has the strong potential to end the game.
However, this build is somewhat simple for Protoss to scout and is vulnerable to timing attacks and all-ins when you only have upgraded Speedlings to defend.

This build opens up with a quick 3 base economy to stay safe against any early Terran shenanigans as well as give you enough power to hit a strong Zergling/Baneling timing before your Terran opponent can get their 3 base economy rolling. One main strength of this build is that the timing push is not all-in, but rather a tool to get you safely to the familiar position of Mutalisks and 4 bases without having to deal with unrelenting Terran pressure.

Scouting

Note the 7:00 Overlord scout to check whether your opponent is going for Bio or Mech. Do not continue with this build order if your Overlord scout spots your opponent going for Mech.
If you scout a Reaper/Hellion/Banshee opener, keeping your Queens alive without Metabolic Boost is quite difficult. Instead of blindly rushing into this build, get a few Spine Crawlers and 1 Spore Crawler per mineral line with an extra Spore or two between the natural and 3rd Hatchery.  It is fine to commit a lot to defense in this situation as going Reaper/Hellion/Banshee slows down any Bio/Mine pushes considerably.
By the time you attack just after 11 minutes, you must know how Terran is going to defend. Run a Zergling or two at Terran?s wall where you want to bust through to spot what army composition is waiting.
- If you scout Bio/Mine, continue as normal with the initial bust.
- If you scout Marine/Tank, consider continuing the bust. However, if you see more than one Siege Tank, be sure to retreat and build your Spire/Creep/Hive!
- If you scout Mech this late, you have most likely already lost. Transitioning into Mutalisks or Swarm Hosts instantly may be enough to keep you alive, but know that you have committed a lot of resources to a bust that cannot succeed.

Transitions

Once you perform the bust, you will either outright win the game, do a little bit of economic damage and trade armies, or completely fail without doing any serious damage. In either of the first two cases, continue to deny the most recent Terran base (either an undefended 3rd, or a future 4th if their 3rd is well established), and continue to play the macro game. If your bust has completely failed, then you can attempt to play the macro game with your 5 Hatcheries already done, but note that you have committed and subsequently a lost of resources going into the macro game.
In a macro game, go up to Hive tech when you most prefer. Some Zergs delay it, some get it faster. Life is known for getting it for +3/+3 and faster Ultralisks. Eventually transitioning into Ultralisk/Queen/Infestor is a solid end-game unit composition ? just be sure that you have enough static defense to deny doom drops and stop Terran from spreading you too thin as you attempt to create this scary army.

Tips

- Against any early pressure, your Queens and a Spine Crawler are all the defense you will need.  With a later Metabolic Boost, you cannot rely on Speedlings to help defend any 1 base all-ins.
- Do your best to clear the map of any of your opponent?s Hellions BEFORE you are ready to bust. Being able to spawn your Banelings close to your opponent as opposed to back at your base makes this bust a lot more effective.
- Get an Overseer before the initial bust to help clear any Widow Mines. However, this build hits early enough that there should not be too many Widow Mines up just yet for you to worry about.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any player going for a Tank-less 3 Command Center build (the current metagame). Also, because you saturate your third base before moving out, it is quite easy to stop Zergling/Baneling production and transition into a macro game with a strong economic advantage.
However, this build sacrifices quick Mutalisks in lieu of more Zerglings and Banelings, so early drops can be a problem.

This is a highly aggressive, 1 base 1/1/1 all-in which focuses on early harass to damage your opponent while simultaneously building up army for a follow-up all-in. While this build has the potential to fall back into a macro game, transitioning into the midgame is difficult if early damage is not inflicted on the opponent.

Scouting

This build gives you several opportunities for scouting. Your first bit of information comes from getting your scouting SCV into his base between 12 and 16 food. If you manage to get your SCV into your opponents base, check for how many Refineries your opponent has. If your opponent does not have gas, they will most likely be doing a 1rax FE build. This presents one of the better scenarios for your early game Hellion drop to workespecially if your opponent does not anticipate the Hellion drop. If your opponent has one Refinery, it likely means that your opponent will be going for Reapers, have a Marine/Hellion defense, or have a Marine/Widow Mine defense. With your Hellions drop, do not over commit, simply keep your opponent busy. If your opponent attempts to Hellion expand, he will pull ahead economically assuming his defense prevents your hellions from inflicting any damage. You will most likely not see a second gas geyser with your SCV scout.

Once you have your first Hellions out, you should have full map control by clearing any XelNaga Towers and poking the front. Running in to spot your opponents natural is also a smart move, but be sure to pull back if there are any units defending. Your Hellions are there to increase the effectiveness of your later all-in, not to end the game early on.

Lastly, when you Hellion drop in his main, you should finally be able to see everything your opponent has gone for. If your opponent has gone for Cloaked Banshees, it will not instantly be a threat because he will need to keep the Banshee in his base to defend his workers. Later, once you have a Raven, Banshees will no longer be an issue. If your opponent has gone for Hellions of his own, be careful when out on the map, and always favor retreating if your Hellions are in danger. If your opponent has gone for Widow Mines, be sure to avoid obvious spots where he could have placed them.

Ideal Game

Your Hellion drop should inflict some kind of damage to your opponent and keep him occupied with defensive measures. However, even while doing damage with them, it is important to keep them alive. With ideal Hellion harass, your later all-in will overwhelm your opponent or trade in your favor.

If your opponent is prepared for the all-in engagement, he will most likely have either a Bunker, Siege Tanks, or both to defend. Your Hellions from earlier can help clear SCVs repairing the Bunker. Assuming you need to siege and push slowly because he has Tanks, consider dropping your Hellions again to divert some forces and his attention. However, remember that every unit is precious, so do not over commit with this drop.

Transitioning

In the situation where you cannot straight up win the game with your all-in but still have him contained, consider expanding and transitioning into Marine/Tank play or Mech. Simply throw down an expansion, take more gas, and ramp up your production from there.

If the all-in fails and your opponent is ahead economically, then you will have most likely lost the game. However, expanding and defending this base with Siege Tanks can still be a last-ditch option.

Tips

- With your first two Hellions, clear the XelNaga Watchtowers and take map control.
- During your Hellion drop, be sure to constantly pump Marines from your Reactored Barracks and produce Siege Tanks.  The strength of this build is the follow-up all-in, not the initial Hellion drop.
- Do NOT lose your Hellions when dropping them.  Use the Medivac boost to get your Hellions out of there if they are ever in danger.
- When moving out, be sure to bring 2 SCVs to repair.
- Slowly siege your opponent unless you are sure you can crush through the front.
- Remember to use Seeker Missile or Auto Turrets from your Raven to push the fight in your favor.

Pros and Cons

This build is a 1-2 punch of sortsfirst hitting with a Hellion drop and then following up with a Marine/Tank all-in. It is often too much for expanding opponents to handle and quickly ends the game. The Hellion drop can also be deadly harass if your opponent does not scout it or defend appropriately.

However, because this build was created by MarineKing himself, it is quite micro intensive, and thus is hard to pull off as a lower league player. Also, as an all-in, theres no clear way to transition out of it if it appears you cannot bust up the ramp.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Factory,CallMule,SCV,Refinery,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Starport,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,SCV,DoubleHellions,Medivac,SupplyDepot,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,SCV,LiftRaxFromTechLab,LandRaxOnReactor,LandFactoryOnTechLab,DoubleMarines,SiegeTank,SupplyDepot,TechLabOnStarport,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,Raven,DoubleMarines,SCV,DoubleMarines,SiegeTank,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Medivac', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:39 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Maru Reaper FE to Hellbat-Banshee Push', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE transitions into a fast 2 base Hellbat Banshee timing in order to crush your opponent early regardless of whether or not they open with Roaches.

Scouting

Use your Reaper to poke around your opponents natural and ascertain whether or not they are performing an early all-in. Later, when you have Hellions out, poke the front to ensure that your opponent is taking a 3rd base and not performing some delayed 2 base all-in. Favor keeping your Hellions alive over getting more scouting information/killing Drones because you will need every Hellion later for the Hellbat Banshee timing.

During your actual attack, be sure to note whether your opponent is defending with Roaches (which means a potential Roach/Hydra midgame, or at the very least delayed Mutalisks) or with Ling/Bane (which means a probable Ling/Bane/Muta midgame, and a more standard Mutalisk timing).

Transitions

This build opens with a 1/1/1 and therefore does not yet commit to a Bio or Mech midgame. It can in fact transition into either quite easily.

For a Bio (+Hellbat or Widow Mine) transition, start your 3rd Command Center as you swap off your Barracks onto the Starports Tech lab in order to start Stimpack research, 2 Engineering Bays, and 4 more Barracks. Use non-Stimpack Medivac drops to delay your opponent while you get up the necessary midgame infrastructure.

For a Mech transition, start your 3rd Command Center, 2 Factories, and 2 more Refineries. Continue Banshee production to deal with a Roach counter-attack as well as take advantage of the delayed Mutalisk tech.

Tips

- Use your initial Marine to try and pick off an early scouting Overlord as well as deny early Drone scouts.
- Your Reaper is not meant to deal damage, but rather give you some basic scouting and map control.
- Do NOT over-commit your Hellions while scouting around your opponents base; you will need all of them for the followup Hellbat Banshee timing to be effective.
- Try and position a Marine or two inside your base to shoot down any scouting Overlords.
- During the actual Hellbat Banshee attack, be sure to stutter step into Roaches and Queens, and spread/kite Zerglings and Banelings.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong 2 base all-in that can outright kill an unsuspecting Zerg opponent, and at the very least forces a huge response in order to defend. By forcing your opponent to make an army, you keep both of your economies low and extend the midgame (where Terran is arguably best in TvZ). Also, this build is better than an exclusively Hellbat attack because of Banshees effectiveness against Roaches.

However this attack requires a lot of micro in order to keep up with a rally of Hellions and Banshees.

This blink is by no means meant to be used aggressively. It is simply adefensive blink opener that can react to many different things and just be an overall safe opener. (You might want to go up to 3 gates if you scout them going factory after 1 rax FE in case they go for a marine/hellion drop so that you can be sure you have enough stalkers out) 

From there you get a robo bay for early colossus andspend all chronoboosts into that roboto get them out as quickly as possible. You also fit in some cannons to help defend vs drops. Even if he doesn't open widow mines, you can still afford them in the build so I don't see any downside to getting them no matter what for the extra defense. 

After that you simplyget 4 more gates to go up to a total of 7and then make only stalkers and colossus and brute force your way in with +1 attack behind you.

Why this late of an attack works

So basically this buildpretends to be a really safe and passive opener. It looks like a passive blink/colossus opener that just defends and takes a slow third to stay extra safe. By the time a terran would be scouting and realizing that you aren't actually taking a third, the attack is going to be knocking at his door. It's simply a very oddly timed attack, but it hits at such a crucial point. This is basically when the terran's third should be getting saturated and his first wave of attempted aggression will have been deflected.You're hitting him in his transitional period between his 2 base set up and his 3 base set up: getting a few more barracks with add ons and his attempted switch into vikings. This is when the terran wants to sit for just a minute before being able to go for more rounds of aggression. If you trade very well earlier on when he tries to do some drops, then that just makes this timing even wider because he will have to keep making medivacs instead of vikings and will just in general have less units.

The reason why there's no zealots or sentries is because the build is focusing so much on anti drop defense early on. It's also an extremely brute force all in. It's meant to really jump into the terrans face and have high chasing power vs retreating medivacs and also to be able todrop vikings instantly. If you can keep the vikings from killing the colossus then they will do an absurd amount of damage with that early of a +1 attack. Thelarge quantity of blink stalkersalso makes it so thatevery unit you have is microable and savable. This isn't like most colossus all ins where it's just straight to colossus as early as possible.

This build is a fast expand build that opens with a Mothership Core for defense, and then follows-up with a very quick 5gate timing with Zealots and Sentries to crush your opponent before they can even enter their midgame tech.

Scouting

After the early game, scouting is much more minimal than you might expect. As long as you can confirm your opponent is getting a third Hatchery (and sometimes even if they are not getting one), you should be able to go through with this build.

With your attack, you will be able to scout what units he is using to defend. If you are fighting mass Speedling, then constantly warp-in Zealots and Sentries.  If you are fighting Roaches, then constantly warp-in Stalkers. Your opponent should not be able to get out either Hydras or Mutalisks in time to defend this attack.

Transitions

If it appears that your opponent has way over-committed to defending your attack with units or Spine Crawlers, you can always retreat and go for the macro game. Either force field your opponent back and walk home or mass recall your army to your natural Nexus. A common follow-up to this build is starting a Robotics Facility and going for Colossi to deal with your opponent s Roaches. Alternatively, you can go for a Stargate and make Phoenix in order to prepare for your opponent s Mutalisks. Be sure to use Hallucinations often to check-up on what midgame tech your opponent is going for. Take a third base when you feel safe.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a Gateway expand, so your 5gate attack will hit very soon (before 7 minutes). This build usually hits your opponent before they have any midgame tech.

However, this build relies on you deflecting your opponent s scouting information in order for it to be maximally effective.

Once you get your 3rd up you'll have to be active in scouting with your phoenix to see what you should do to follow up. If you scout aheavy roach reactionto your 3rd, then you should instantly start chronoing void rays out of your 3 stargates. You can start getting immortals as well from the robo if you really think you can't hold.

If he goes for ahydra ling bust, then you need to continuously chrono phoenix. You don't try to get colossus up ASAP, that will just end in tears.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'MC Oracle Expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This PvT opener opens with early Oracles to smash through un-upgraded marines and harass your opponent?s mineral line, all while taking an expansion back at home and transitioning into the midgame.

Scouting

This build opens aggressively with lots of units, so there is no need to be worried about early pressure. However, in order for you to control your Oracles well and attack in the correct places, it is necessary to know what your opponent is building. Thus, use your early game map control with your Stalkers and Mothership Core to poke in and see whether your opponent is going for Widow Mines/where they are building Turrets/how they have positioned their Marines so that you will know when and how to attack with your oracles.

Transitions

This build transitions into any normal midgame that you would like. At around the 8 minute mark, plant down either a Robotics Facility or Twilight Council to start your teching into Colossus or High Templars+Storm. Then, after your Oracle harass has finished, you will already be halfway to your desired tech. Getting more gateways down and the upgrades (+1 Ground Armor and Charge/Storm) started while you are harassing your opponent is very important.

Alternatively, you can go for a Phoenix/Colossus midgame army. Plant down a Robotics Facility at around the 8 minute mark and tech straight for Colossi on 4 Assimilators. When your Robotics Bay finishes, start 2 more Gateways, start your first Colossus, and begin producing Phoenix in order to re-converge to a play style akin to Jim?s Phoenix/Colossus Build.

Tips

- Use your first Stalker to deny an SCV/Reaper scout and keep your opponent in the dark as to what build you are going.
- Rally your Oracles to an airspace near your opponent?s base so that your push happens as soon as you are ready.
- The Mothership Core can poke in and around your opponent?s main base to see what tech buildings they have and/or what units they are building.
- Go in with your first Oracle if they opened with gas to start applying pressure soon. If you wait for 3 or 4 Oracles, a Widow Mine drop might be already on the way and you would not be able to defend it.
- Wait for more Oracles if they opened gasless 1rax FE and your stalkers have not been able to do any damage. If you go in too soon, then they?ll just build a reactive missile turret and shut down your later Oracles.
- Remember: Oracles scale REALLY well. 3 Oracles can take down up to 10 marines without losing a single Oracle.  Be aggressive vs marines, and super defensive vs turrets/widow mines.
- Do not forget to include the Mothership Core in the fight ? its DPS and Time Warp spell are very useful when taking out marines/units.
- Start that midgame transition BEFORE you focus on the harass in your opponent?s base so that after the Oracle harass has finished, you will already be halfway to your desired midgame tech.

Pros and Cons

This build gives you map control and hits your opponents with a lot of early game Oracles to destroy a mineral line. It is strong because Oracles absolutely destroy un-upgraded marines, and are maneuverable enough that they can track down and run after SCVs.

However, opening with this build delays your expand a lot more than if you had opened straight 1gate FE. Because you have less economy, the midgame Terran timing attacks with medivacs are even scarier than normal (unless you do damage with your Oracles), so you actually have to do damage to attempt to transition into the midgame. Remember that Oracles have very little health, so you have to babysit your units if you have any hope of not losing them instantly to a well placed Missile Turret/Widow Mine.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,MothershipCore,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Stargate,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Oracle,Probe,Nexus,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Chronoboost,Oracle,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Oracle,Probe,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:39 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'PartinG 3 gate blink', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'The most important part of this build is that it incorporates anMSCore scout. While this did get slightly nerfed with the new patch, so far it is still definitely possible to pull them off, however you just have to be a little bit careful.

The scout allows you to see exactly what tech you're going against since blink can be a little bit risky at times. Here's a general idea of what you can do vs some particular openings with this build:

Vs. Robo expands: So robo expands are tough builds to crack with blink openers. You really need to stretch them thin with blink and get a little fancy with warping in a sentry and force them into the main and forcefield them in to snipe the natural or visa versa etc. But you normally can't straight win vs robo expands an you'll just need to expand and probe behind it. For a little more in expanding out of blink openers in PvP check outDay9's daily #674.

Vs. Stargate openers: So generally this is where this build shines the most. You should be able to get in their while their unit count is low and screw them up. There isn't too much to say here except to remember about the potential oracle swinging in the back and ruining your day, as well as to not be too overeager with void ray #yolo blinks as you can find yourself losing quite quickly. Just be patient and mass a good stalker count and hit when you know it's right.

Vs. DTs: This is where the MSCore scout comes into play the most. When going vs DT's you're going to need to drop a robo ASAP (before or after blink depending on how quickly they made the dark shrine) and you're going to have to macro out of it. It's very difficult to break a DT opener with blink as you have to wait for multiple observers to know you're safe. Just poke and prod a bit and see what damage you can do while expanding yourself.

Vs. Blink: This is all up to micro. You have to simple be VERY careful about analyzing your stalker count in comparison to his before engaging and to micro your god damn heart out. Blink vs blink doesn't happen too often, but when it does it's literally about who has more stalkers, so you need to be extra crisp when this happens.

This cheese proxies your initial Pylon at your opponent?s natural and makes Stalkers 2 at a time from 2 proxied Gateways. This proxy Stalker Rush is a very effective cheese that focuses on early game micro to destroy your opponent before the midgame.

Scouting

This build skips all scouting, for you are placing your first Pylon proxied at your opponent?s natural expansion regardless of what your opponent is doing. All of your scouting will come from your initial attack with your first Gateway units. The build itself will not change regardless of what you scout ? only your unit positioning and micro.

Transitions

This proxy Stalker Rush is an all-in in every respect: proxying the initial Pylon at your opponent?s natural, cutting Probe production at 12, non-stop chronoboosting your Gateways, and skipping Warpgate Research. Thus, there is no well-defined transition. If you are late in your execution and do not outright kill your opponent (or at least take out their army and 10+ Probes), then you will most likely lose the game to any sort of Gateway attack follow-up.

Tips

- ALL OF YOUR CHRONOBOOST MUST BE DUMPED INTO YOUR GATEWAYS. The limiting factor on this build is how fast you can pump out units from your Gateways. Be sure to non-stop chronoboost your Gateways as they are producing the Zealot and later Stalkers so as to attack as early as possible.
- Poke in with your first Zealot and Probe and force your opponent to lose mining time. However, be wary of a Probe surround. Favor keeping the Zealot alive over killing enemy Probes.
- Once your first 2 Stalkers finish, you must commit to the attack as quickly as possible and never stop Stalker production until either you have won the game or you have lost all of your units. The strength of this all-in is how quickly and ferociously it attacks, but if you are not constantly attacking then your opponent?s economic advantage can destroy you.
- If your opponent pulls a lot of Probes to defend, be sure to back off and fight near the main ramp. Use your 18 Pylon to buffer damage and provide high ground vision for your Stalkers to shoot up the cliff.

Pros and Cons

This proxy Stalker Rush is a hyper-aggressive all-in that is able to get 2 Stalkers and 1 Zealot at your opponent?s base at 4:00. Because of how quickly this build attacks, it can punish most greedy PvP builds or players with poor micro with ease.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker back to the protection of your Sentries/Force fields and warp-in units quickly if you have to defend an early attack.

The majority of your scouting comes from your Hallucinated Phoenix. Your phoenix should be able to get into your opponent?s main base and determine what tech route you see your opponent going.

- If your opponent is expanding quickly, then feel safe. Consider going for a midgame Immortal+Gateway bust.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then be sure that you do not fall behind in the Immortal/Colossus count going into the midgame. Do NOT over produce Stalkers.
- If your opponent has a Stargate, then be sure to not take damage against early Phoenix or Oracles. Produce several Stalkers to initially protect your mineral lines, but consider getting a Stargate of your own or going for a quick Blink timing in order to truly stay safe against your opponent. Keep a tabs on when they take their natural expansion ? a 3gate Stargate attack can be deadly if you are skipping too many warp-ins or teching too aggressively.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then make one Observer for detection against DTs and constantly produce Immortals. Also be sure to position your army/Mothership Core defensively in order to safely defend any Blink attacks.

Transitions

This build is a very strong macro opener that transitions into a macro game quite easily. However, the actual unit composition of that macro game very often depends completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with. If your opponent stays on one base for too long, then throw down more Gateways, constantly make units, and prepare to defend your natural with Stalkers, Immortals, and your Planetary Nexus. In Robotics vs Stargate macro games, quickly switch into Blink or Stargate play of your own so as to not lose against any Void Ray based armies. In Robotics vs Robotics macro games, Immortal count and/or Colossus count are the most important things.  Keep tabs on your opponent?s tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Robotics vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponent?s potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by producing Immortals+Gateway units or Colossus for defense.

Tips

- Use all your initial chronoboost on Probes so as to establish your economic advantage going into the midgame.
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial Stalker to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap?s 3gate All-in).
- Against all 1 base attacks, you must defend using your Planetary Nexus. To maximize your protection, save your Mothership Core energy as long as possible ? only calling in your Planetary Nexus once your opponent has committed to attacks. Be sure to constantly chronoboost Immortals out for maximum DPS against ground-based armies.
- Against Blink play, be sure to position some of your army and an Immortal or two in your main base to destroy any Stalkers that blink up outside the range of your Planetary Nexus.
- Against Stargate play, be sure to warp-in some initial Stalkers and position your units to defend both mineral lines from potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very versatile, macro build that takes advantage of the power and range of your Planetary Nexus in order to stay safe against early attacks. It also gets detection and Immortals for defense, so very often you have a more stable opening than most other PvP builds.

However, defending early Stargate play can be quite tricky as your Robotics Facility does not help at all in producing anti-air units. Also, this build requires a lot of scouting information to be executed effectively, so getting a Hallucination into your opponent?s base is crucial.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Probe,MothershipCore,Sentry,Nexus,Gateway,Sentry,Pylon,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Immortal,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:40 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Maru 14 CC to MMMH Timing', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This CC First build takes your economy immediately into the midgame and then transitions into a 9 minute, 2 base Marine/Hellion/Medivac timing with Stimpack.

Scouting

Build the Command Center on the high ground and then wall-off with your initial Barracks. This way, you will not have to worry about early Zerglings because you will have a full wall. Thus, SCV scouting is no longer necessary.

Your first scouting comes from the first Hellions you make. With these Reactor Hellions, you can take map control, clears out any Zerglings at watchtowers, and pokes Zergs front to spot the Zergs third base, any buildings at the front, and any units that Zerg is making.

If you see a ton of Speedlings, then make sure your Hellion micro is on point. Feel free to pull back behind your natural wall in order to more effectively deal with Speedlings.

If you see Roaches, then immediately cut Reactor Hellion production and start making Widow Mines two at a time. Delay your Starport for a little while in order to afford Marauders, and consider cutting SCVs in order to complete a wall-off at your natural and prevent your opponent from running past your Bunker/Widow Mines.

If you see two Evolution Chambers, then assume your opponent is playing a macro game.

Alternatively, if you see a third base, then you can also assume your opponent is playing a macro game.

Transitions

This build transitions pretty normally into standard Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine play as well as Marine/Tank/Medivac play in a pretty common manner. However, because of the resources and time you have devoted to Bio units and upgrades, this build cannot transition into Mech.

For either the Bio/Mine or Marine/Tank transition, as you are pushing out, instantly start your 3rd Command Center, Combat Shields, and 2 Engineering Bays. It is also strongly suggested that you continue Medivac and Marine production before adding on more Barracks so that you can continue unrelenting drop play and keep your opponent on their half of the map while you are attempting to take your own third and get into your comfortable late-game infrastructure. When your Engineering Bays finish, be sure to start your Infantry upgrades, all of your Refineries, and throw down up to 5 more Barracks to be able to pump out your 3 base army.

If you are going for Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine play, be sure to start a Reactor on your naked Factory and start Widow Mine production (adding a 2nd Factory with a Tech lab for the Widow Mine upgrade once you have later secured your third).

If you are going for a Marine/Tank/Medivac play, be sure to start a Tech lab on your naked Factory and start Siege Tank production (adding a 2nd Factory with a Tech lab once you have later secured your third).

Tips

- Do NOT over commit with your initial Hellions. Use them exclusively for scouting purposes in the early game; their true purpose is to bolster your ground army in the actual Marine/Hellion/Medivac timing attack.
- Against any all-ins with this build, you must rely on your Bunker placement, SCV control, and scouting it coming. Be active on the map with your first Hellions so that you know what is coming your way before it gets to your doorstep.
- Feel free to push out with your Bio army even before Stimpack/Medivacs are even done. As long as you have Hellions scouting in front to ensure you are not being all-inned, your Bio army can be walking across the map while your Medivacs boost in behind them so that you hit your opponent the second Stimpack finishes.
- Do NOT clump up against Banelings. Your opponent should not be able to have that many Banelings by the 9 minute attack, but be sure to spread your army and micro appropriately if you see Banelings on the field.
- Remember to pick up your Marines into the Medivacs and boost away as soon as your army is finally overtaken. Keeping your opponent on their side of the map while you set up your own third base is crucial.
- Save at least one scan to kill creep. As a Zerg, losing your initial midgame creep and a Queen or two spreading it can be devastating for the later stages of the game.

Pros and Cons

This build opens quite economically, and then transitions into making a strong army and hitting your opponent with a lot of units at the 9 minute mark before they can even stabilize their third base economy. It is a very strong build for punishing greedy Zergs.

However, while it is a CC First opener that is not at all all-in, it is definitely not nearly as macro-oriented as the standard Reactor Hellion 3CC build or other 3CC builds such as Polts Map Control Build. Also, if your opponent can see it coming and overproduces units to defend, you will have to pick up and rely on drop play instead of a large frontal assault to get an advantage.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Bunker,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SCV,CallMule,Factory,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,SCV,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Refinery,TechLabOnBarracks,CallMule,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,StimPack,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marauder,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Starport,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleHellions,SCV,Marauder,SCV,CallMule,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,Marauder,DoubleMedivacs,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnFactory,Marauder,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:40 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'NaNiwa Zealot-Immortal All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Gateway Expand and then transitions into a very quick all-in with 2 Immortals, a Warp Prism, and a lot of +1 Zealots.

Scouting

After the early game, scouting is much more minimal than you might expect. As long as you can confirm your opponent is getting a third Hatchery, you should be able to go through with this build.

However, if your opponent scouts your Robotics Facility early on, then you can send your Warp Prism directly towards your opponent s base in order to both fake pressure and see what units/buildings they have made.  This Warp Prism poke provides a bit of scouting that may help you deduce what unit composition your opponent will try to defend your all-in with.

Transitions

This build is a 2base all-in, so there is no standard way to follow-up this build should the attack not outright win the game. If your opponent holds off your all-in without taking too much damage, then you will most likely lose the game soon after. That being said, starting more Assimilators and teching to either Colossi or Blink Stalkers (depending on what unit composition your opponent used to defend your all-in) for a second desperation all-in might just be enough to win the game.

Tips

- The limiting factor in this build is the Robotics Facility time. Be sure to chronoboost your Robotics Facility to get out the Warp Prism and Immortals in time for such a fast attack.
- Send your Warp Prism to your opponent s base as soon as it completes for both fake pressure and potential scouting information.
- When you move out for the attack, be sure to fully wall-off your natural expansion (and even potentially build some cannons) to stop your opponent from running around your army and going for a base trade.
- The most important part of the army are your Robotics units. Keep your Zealots all in front of your Immortals/Warp Prism so that they tank all (or most) incoming damage. Using the Warp Prism, pick up Immortals that are being targeted down to move them further back behind your Zealot meat shield. If your Warp Prism is being targeted down, bring it out of the fight and retreat a bit before warping in more Zealots.
- If your opponent is trying to defend with Roaches or Mutalisks and you have a little extra gas, then mix in some Stalkers into the mix for some extra DPS.

Pros and Cons

This is a strong all-in that hits before your opponent can have much tech out in order to end the game quickly. With +1 Zealots dealing lots of damage to Zerglings, and Immortals shredding up Roaches, this build walks through most Zerg defenses with ease.

However, none of your units are anti-air. Thus, if your opponent gets out Mutalisks before your attack has dealt lots of damage, then you will be in a lot of trouble.

If you don't want to play that greedy you can still do a similar version of the build off of a FFE, it'll just hit a tad later and you may want to just adapt it to be not as all in.

The build itself is quite simple. You get a fast nexus, go into 1 gate for sentry production to stay safe/build up energy, expand, make more gates, and then attack with mass sentry/stalker at an awkward time for the zerg to deal with. There isn't TOO much to explain with this one as it all comes down to execution.

There are a few reasons behind getting the fast 3rd even if you aren't actually transferring probes to it.

1) It fakes the zerg out. When they see that early of a Nexus they're going to do one of two things. They will either make mass units to try and kill it (which is fine since you're going to have 7 gates worth of production and a bunch of sentries) or they go heavy econ and drone up hard (which is also good because then they don't have units to defend the attack).

2) It provides a back up plan. If the attack doesn't go 100% as planned, you can always start making probes 3 at a time and transfer them down while starting to tech up. That way if things ever go wrong you aren't 100% all in (hence the "semi" from earlier).

3) Extra chronoboost for gateways. A small addition, however a nice one if you can spend your chronoboost well.

A small note that I feel would be a good addition to this build that coincides with the 2nd point above. I think as you are moving out (or as your +1 is finishing) you should get a twilight council as well. This makes it easier to transition into +2 blink and beyond if your initial pressure can't finish them off and since the build itself doesn't starve you for money, there is no harm in getting it.

The other benefit to this build is that you don't even have to all in with it if you don't want to. You can do the same opener and if you see the zerg being greedy and you want to play greedy too, then by all means go for it. You took a 6:50 3rd base.

This build opens with a 1gate FE and then transitions into a strong timing attack with +2/+2 Chargelots and Archons.

Push out when your 3rd Archon finishes (@11:00ish) with 3 Sentries, 3 Archons, 1 Stalker, and around 12 Zealots, with +2/+2 about to finish.

Scouting

In the early game, Probe scout after your Gateway in order to spot whether your opponent is opening with a Reaper or Widow Mine drop. Against Reaper play you have to position your initial few units very defensively in order to avoid losing any Probes. Against a Widow Mine drop, be sure to build those Photon Cannons in your mineral lines as soon as your Forges finish. After the early game, scouting is much more minimal than you might expect. As long as you can confirm your opponent is not 1 base all-inning you (Hallucinations can give you a lot of information), you can perform this build.

Transitions

This build is a strong two base timing attack, so be sure to commit all your energy into non-stop warping in from a proxy Pylon in order to bust through your opponent?s front. In most situations, you will simply be able to walk through your opponent?s front and win the game.

However, if your opponent has a strong defense at his natural (Supply Depots and multiple Bunkers), you do already have plenty of Probes back at home, so you can simply start a 3rd Nexus, resume Probe Production, continue upgrades by getting +3/+3, and transition into Storm play. If you are going for this macro play, then be sure to get out several Colossus before you max out for a stronger 200 supply army.

Tips

- You are only able to afford so many units because of how many Probes you have. Be sure to Chronoboost your Nexii as often as possible in the early game to get up a strong 2 base economy.
- The limiting factor in this build is the Forge upgrades.  After the early game, Chronoboost your Forges as often as you can so that your 11 minute attack hits with +2/+2.
- Hallucinate Phoenix to get scouting information on your opponent?s opening build order.
- Against Reaper play, position your initial units defensively.
- Against Widow Mine play, be sure to get out those Photon Cannons in each mineral line on time. Using your Photon Overcharge and target firing an early Medivac can be a game changer in defending early pressure.
- Set up multiple proxy Pylons before you are ready to move out so that even if your opponent kills one or two of them, you will be able to reinforce your attack.
- During the attack, be sure that your army does not waste time attacking buildings.  Focus fire and reposition your army so that everything is always fighting your opponent?s army.
- If your opponent has a solid wall at his natural, then do not commit to a doomed attack. Simply playing the macro game with your upgrade advantage is a much stronger option.

Pros and Cons

This is a strong attack that destroys Bio players who do not have good building placement or who are playing too greedy. Also, your strong attack has +2/+2 and 60 Probes ? so even if it fails, you have a strong economy and upgrade lead going into the late game.

This build is not great against early Widow Mine drops because your only detection is the Photon Cannons in your mineral lines. However if you defend a Widow Mine drop without losing too much, your follow-up attack will destroy your opponent unless they are very well prepared.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Nexus,MothershipCore,WarpgateUpgrade,Pylon,Stalker,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Forge,Forge,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,GroundWeaponsLevel1,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,GroundArmorLevel1,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,WarpInSentry,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,TwilightCouncil,Probe,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,Charge,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,GroundWeaponsLevel2,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,GroundArmorLevel2,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,TemplarArchives,Probe,Probe,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,WarpInHighTemplar,WarpInHighTemplar,WarpInHighTemplar,Pylon,Pylon,Pylon,WarpInHighTemplar,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInHighTemplar,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInZealot,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,WarpInHighTemplar,ArchonFromTwoHT,ArchonFromTwoHT,ArchonFromTwoHT,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:40 PM;

PartinG even gets 2 base all inned this game after his first storm drop and he can still hold after even trying to take a greedy 3rd.

The timings for the templar archives can vary based off of what happens in the early game.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Polt Gas First Banshee', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This gas first Banshee opener used by Polt and many other top level Korean Terrans opens with the fastest Cloaked Banshees possible. The Banshee(s) are used to stay safe against early attacks as well as harass your opponent, in order to get an economic advantage going into the midgame.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your Orbital Command to check whether or not your opponent is opening with Reapers. Against an opponent opening Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe; thus, you should try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or expanded at your natural with your first few Marines.

Your next scout will come with your Banshee. With this Banshee, you can check what your opponents opener is. Against another Banshee player, follow-up your first Banshee with a Raven (and then potentially Viking if extra anti-air is needed). Against a Hellbat dropping player, make a few Widow Mines to burrow defensively against any incoming drop, as you use several Banshees to out-harass him. Against a player going for a Widow Mine Drop, position your Marines defensively at home and be sure to have enough scans to deal with his Widow Mines. Building a Raven might be useful, but not until after you have 2 Banshees with which to harass your opponent.

Finally, be sure to keep an eye out on what midgame transition your opponent is doing. Look for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either all-in, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play quite easily.

For an all-in transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory and start Siege Tank production instantly. When you hit 2 or 3 Siege Tanks, grab all of your Marines (>20), your Banshees/Vikings, and attempt to break your opponents front with a slow siege push.

It is possible to go into Marine/Tank or Mech after a 3 Command Center follow-up if you are sure your opponent will not be going for any more early game pressure. Start a Raven in order to save enough minerals to afford 2 Command Centers and then transition into either Marine/Tank or Mech just as below.

When transitioning into macro Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production after you start a 2nd Command Center. That way you have enough defense early and later can have a strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use. Against 2rax Reaper, you should delay your Tech lab until your Factory has completed at least one Hellion. Otherwise you might straight up die before you even start your first Banshee.
- Watch for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop your Banshee as you enter your opponents base.  Cloak your Banshee as soon as you see any potential for burrowed Widow Mines.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that are undefended by a Turret. If you are transitioning to a 1/1/1 all-in, then be sure to target-fire Marines as well, for this directly strengthens your attack.
- Always favor keeping your Banshee(s) alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two. You can also repair a weakened Banshee at home with SCVs if you can keep it alive.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural.  You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This gas first Banshee build is an aggressive opener in TvT. Also, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for you are able to transition into an all-in, 3 Command Center play, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play. Also, this build requires a lot less APM than other TvT builds, so it can be very useful for lower league players.

However, this build is extraordinarily weak against early Reaper builds because you open with so few Marines. Also, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind your opponent in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades, especially if they open with a fast expansion. Finally, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,SCV,Factory,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,Refinery,SCV,Marine,Starport,TechLabOnFactory,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,LandStarportOnTechLab,Banshee,CloakingField,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,CallMule,WidowMine,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Banshee,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:41 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'PartinG 3 Base 7 Gate', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Nexus First and only enough units to secure a ridiculously fast 3rd base. With a 3 base economy, it then hits a 9 minute 7 gate attack comprised of mainly Stalkers and Sentries.

Scouting

This build opens incredibly greedily, so be sure that your opponent is expanding and droning with an initial Probe scout. Besides any initial Probe(s), however, this build does not give you any tools with which to scout your opponent. The majority of your scouting will come with the actual attack at 9 minutes.

Transitions

This build can either all-in or transition comfortably into a macro game.

If you are choosing to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly warp-in and chronoboost your Gateways, set up several proxy Pylons around your opponent?s third base, and stop all Probe production.

If you are choosing to play the macro game, then only use the attack to hopefully deal a bit of damage while you continue producing Probes and teching at home. Getting a Twilight Council, all of your gasses, and going for a +2 Blink Stalker army is a good choice.  Alternatively, you can start a Robotics Facility, all of your gasses, and go straight for Colossi.

Tips

- Spend all of your early game chronoboost on your two Nexus to maximize Probe production.
- Keep your Mothership Core out in front of your natural to help ward off any scouting Zerglings.
- Until you are ready to attack, position your Sentries and Zealot very defensively. Staying against buildings or walls will increase the effectiveness of defensive force fields dramatically.
- Use 2 of your Gateways to wall-in a Photon Cannon while your third base is being set up. A Cannon that cannot be targeted by Zerglings is incredibly effective at stopping runbys.
- Be sure to start moving out before +1 actually finishes in order to hit your opponent as early as possible.
- Constantly warp-in Stalkers with the attack, using your initial 8 Sentries to keep back enemy Roach/Ling armies.
- Don?t forget to mass recall your army back home if you end up getting surrounded.

Pros and Cons

This build is an incredibly greedy build that initially powers economy hard and then transitions into a powerful 7 Gate attack. You have both a strong army and a strong economy.

However, this build does not get much tech before the attack.

This Reaper FE gets out a lot of units quickly in order to defend any Oracle or Blink Stalker attacks, while transitioning directly into completely standard 2 Base bio infrastructure. The versatility of this build sets it apart from the other TvP openers: Polts build lets you defend, attack, or play off any shenanigans your opponent may through at you.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they get an expansion (or note if they do not expand by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Extra Bunkers and/or an Engineering Bay for defense may be a smart investment.

If your opponent is going for a 2 Base Blink Stalker attack, then slow down your tech and gas income in favor of more units and more Bunkers. Start 2 Bunkers at the front and be ready to repair them with SCVs while you buy time for Combat Shields, more Marauders, and eventual Medivacs to pop.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and a large Bio army.  As you are taking map control with your initial Medivacs, be sure to add a 3rd Command Center, 2 more Barracks, and finish getting Concussive Shells and Combat Shields. Add on another Engineering Bay and an Armory to continue your upgrades as soon as you can afford it.

Note that you can switch the order of the 4th and 5th Barracks with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost and the scary late game Protoss army, most Terrans have been getting their infrastructure up early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having extra reinforcements.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important; if you keep all of your SCVs in gas, then you will not have the minerals to get your Command Center or extra Barracks at the correct time.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper.  Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add up to 2 Bunkers at the front, and start that Marauder production as soon as possible.
- Oracles massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you should consider skipping Marauders for more Marines or even start an emergency Engineering Bay for one turret per mineral line.
- Polt sometimes goes for an optional poke with his initial Marauder and several Marines if he has confirmed his opponent is not going for a Stargate. Be sure to keep these units alive  their only purpose is to take up a central XelNaga Watch tower
- When transitioning into the midgame, setting up your infrastructure while being aggressive with your first few Medivacs can outright win you the game.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because of the versatility inherent in its play. It makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game, gets up enough infrastructure to deal with all early and midgame attacks such as Oracle all-ins or Blink Stalker Timings, and then transitions into a completely standard bio midgame. It truly is an effective build to learn if you want to play safe and standard in TvP.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that it requires good scouting in order to take advantage of the versatility inherent in the build.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GoOutScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,MineralScv,CallMule,SCV,CommandCenter,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,Marine,StimPack,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,DoubleMarines,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,Factory,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,ScannerSweep,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,CallMule,Refinery,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,EngineeringBay,Marine,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,DoubleMarines,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,CombatShield,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,SCV,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMedivacs,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,ConcussiveShells,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:41 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Proxy Thor Drop', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build rushes for Thors and a Medivac as fast as possible and then goes for a hilarious all-in with Thor Drops. There is no transition with this build  you pull all your SCVs and crush your opponent as soon as possible.

Scouting

There is no purpose scouting. You are going to do the same build no matter what, and it only wastes mining time to pull an SCV from the mineral line.

Transitions

There are no transitions from this all-in. Keep rallying Marines and your next Thor and all of your SCVs and hope it is enough to win the game.

Tips

- When your Medivac pops, load up your Thor and drop your opponent, trying to kill production or SCVs.
- Avoid fighting your opponents army with your initial Thor drop at all costs. Only engage your opponents army directly once your Marines and SCVs are in the fight as well.
- Make sure to pull around 10 SCVs and attack with all of your Marines when you start your 2nd Thor so that your 2 Thors, 12 Marines, and 10 SCVs all get to your opponents base at the same time.
- During the fight, surround your Thor(s) with SCVs and repair.
- Use your Marines for a bit of extra DPS as they sit behind your Thor(s), but the true power of this all-in comes from the fact that Thors being repaired take close to no damage from early game Terran units.

Pros and Cons

This build rolls over most 1rax FE builds. Also, its a hilarious all-in that straight up kills unprepared opponents or opponents who dont have good repair micro. Also, a huge pro is that this build IS A THOR DROP.

However, this build is very weak against Reapers because you only have 2 Marines to defend against Reapers in the early game. That being said, if you can ward off the Reapers without losing too many SCVs, you might still win because Thors are obviously strong against Reapers in direct fights.  This build is also very bad against Banshees, but its possible to win the base trade because Thors also destroy Banshees in an actual fight.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Factory,CallMule,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Armory,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,Starport,SCV,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,Thor,Medivac,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Thor,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:41 PM;

Because this build opens with as many different map control units as Terran has, there is no need for super early SCV scouting. Your initial scout comes from your Reaper(s) poking into your opponents base. Check for a lack of a natural, early gas, or any quick tech buildings. Consider cutting Hellions and getting Widow Mines instead if your opponent is going for a very early all-in.

The next scout comes from your Reapers and Hellions poking the front.  You should be able to spot a 3rd base and your opponents Queen count.  If you see a lack of Queens and no 3rd base, then be prepared for a 2 base all-in of sorts. Extra bunkers, a full wall-off, and Marauders/Siege Tanks are the best ways to defend most Roach or Baneling based all-ins.

Finally, your last scout comes from a Medivac drop and your Viking. Use your Viking to kill Overlords blocking your 3rd base or scouting around the map. You can also use the Viking to keep tabs on your opponents base count up until they have any anti-air (usually Mutalisks). Be sure not to lose the Viking to Queens, however, so stay off creep. Also, use your Medivac drop for map control at the front. Scan, kill creep, and pick up and leave with your 8 units up everywhere your opponent is spreading creep until your opponent has Mutalisks.

This build gets you map control in every way: initial ground control comes from your Reapers; follow-up ground control comes from your Reaper/Hellion pokes; follow-up air control comes from your Viking on Overlord-killing duty; and follow-up creep control comes from a squadron of Marine/Marauder in your Medivac. Be sure to use all of these to their fullest in order to have maximum scouting information.

Transitions

This build transitions well into both Marine/Tank or Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine. It can also transition into Mech, but anyone who watches Polt as a player knows that he never goes Mech in basically any matchup, so I have opted not to write-up the Mech transition.

For either transition, start Stimpack research and 2 Engineering Bays so that your midgame army will have some staying power on the field. Once you have minerals, throw down up to 7 Barracks and an extra Factory to reach the 3 base infrastructure that you need to out-produce your Zerg opponent. Start producing Siege Tanks or Widow Mines from your initial Factory to get a healthy unit count while you are building up your Bio army.

Lift up your third base and take your third once you feel safe, starting an Armory so as to continue your upgrades. Remember to stay on top of your huge mineral count. Because this build only stays on 3 buildings for unit production for quite some time, but gets you a similar income, your mineral income will seem much larger than you think. Start those Engineering Bays and Barracks as soon as you can afford them for a strong midgame army.

Tips

- Do NOT over commit your initial Reapers by trying to kill Drones. Use them more for scouting and prioritize keeping them alive so as to keep your opponents early game units back at home.
- Do NOT over commit your initial Reaper/Hellion poke by trying to kill Drones. Again, use them more for scouting and prioritize keeping them alive unless you see a huge opening that you can punish (such as spotting your opponents Queens off creep and knowing that your opponent does not have Zergling Speed).
- If you spot your opponent going all-in, then be sure to stop map-control-unit production and instantly begin Widow Mines and Marauders. Adding an extra Bunker and/or completing your wall-off at your natural will help provide buffers against any incoming attacks as well.
- When your Viking pops, be sure to shoot down as many Overlords as you can. Simply shift-queue up an attack route around all of your side of the map in order to kill any Overlords your opponent has that are off creep.
Use your initial Medivac and several Marines/Marauders for creep-killing duty. Scan, kill creep, and pick up and leave with your 8 units up everywhere your opponent is spreading creep until your opponent has Mutalisks. Try and pick off a Queen if you can.
- Once you throw down your 3rd Command Center, you are going to have A LOT of minerals. Be sure to transition quickly by starting the Engineering Bays, Barracks, and Refineries as soon as you can afford them.

Pros and Cons

This build is quite strong because of its ability to scout and harass early on.  With Reapers, Hellions, Vikings, and Medivacs all being used to take map control, and a 1/1/1 at home with the versatility to react to whatever units your opponent seems to be making, this build is also quite safe against any early all-ins that your opponent might try to do. Finally, if your opponent ever slips up and does not adequately prepare for your continuous production of map control units, you can quickly kill many Drones and take a huge economic advantage as what happens in game 5 of Polt vs HyuN.

However, this build is not quite as economical as a 3CC build such as Innovations Reactor/Hellion 3CC build. It also requires a lot of APM in order to micromanage all of your early game harassing/map control units while keeping up your macro at home. Finally, it delays Stimpack by several minutes when compared to most other builds, so all of your early aggression must come from Stimpack-less Bio units and your map control units.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Reaper,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Factory,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Starport,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleHellions,SCV,Marine,Viking,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,Marine,SCV,DoubleWidowMines,SCV,SCV,Marine,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Marine,CommandCenter,Medivac,SCV', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:21:40 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Reaper FE into 3 Rax Stim Timing', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE transitions into a very quick 2 base Stim timing with Combat Shields. With such a fast attack, you can set the pace of the game instead of letting Protoss dictate when you attack.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they get an expansion (or note if they do not expand by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Extra Bunkers and/or an Engineering Bay for defense may be a smart investment. However, if you can hold until Stimpack and Combat Shields finish (@8:50ish  much earlier than most other builds), then you will be in a great position to counter attack your opponent and do crippling damage.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and a large Bio army.  Before you focus on your attack, be sure to start a Factory for a standard Reactored Medivac follow-up. After the attack, get a 3rd Command Center, 2 more Barracks (for a total of 5), 2 Engineering Bays, and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to head into a strong, late game army.

Note that you can switch the order of the 4th and 5th Barracks with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost and the scary late game Protoss army, most Terrans have been getting their infrastructure up early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having extra reinforcements.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important; if you keep all of your SCVs in gas, then you will not have the minerals to get your Command Center or extra Barracks at the correct time.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add up to 2 Bunkers at the front, and start that Marauder production as soon as possible.
- Oracles massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you should consider skipping Marauders for more Marines or even start an emergency Engineering Bay for one turret per mineral line. Note that even if your opponent does early game damage with an Oracle, your 9 minute attack can still end the game if your opponents follow-up is not executed precisely.
- Be sure to move out with your army BEFORE Stimpack and Combat Shields finish. You want to be attacking your opponents natural expansion as soon as those two upgrades finish.
- If your opponent is out of position, you can kill their entire army or snipe their natural expansion. However, be sure that you focus fire one or the other down  losing too much DPS by having your units attack both the Nexus and the army is the main way to screw up the attack.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because of how many units you can get out for a pre-10 minute attack. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Therefore, this build is a much more aggressive variant of the other Reaper expands possible in TvP.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that with such a low Marine count in the early game, fast Oracles can do a lot of damage if your scouting is not perfect.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,GoOutScv,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Barracks,SCV,DoubleMarines,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,DoubleMarines,OrbitalCommand,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,DoubleMarines,StimPack,Marine,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,CombatShield,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,Factory,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marauder,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,Starport,Refinery,ReactorOnFactory,EngineeringBay,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,CallMule,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,InfantryWeaponsLevel1', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:22:10 PM;

Everything about the opener is extremely safe (besides the late MSCore which can easily be added in if you suspect some form of 2 base all in) and completely standard. It even incorporates an early zealot just in case. If you want you can get rid of the zealot if you know 100% that they won't be doing any form of speedling bust or whatever so that way you can get all the timings slightly quicker. However, for the added security the early zealot gives you outweighs getting the pressure at their base 5 seconds earlier for the most part. The build also gives off a very normal feel. A zerg will easily look at this and think it's a standard every day phoenix into colossus passive macro opening. This helps in with the attack later on.

There have been other variants of this kind of build that are slightly more all in, (sentry drop version, 7 gate version etc.) where if you do enough damage you'll be fine to macro out if you can't out right kill them however if you get shut down completely you're basically lose.This version only has 4 gates and zealots and gets a quicker robo bay in exchange so that way it still packs a big punch with the +1 and 8 zealots at once (4 warped in before loaded up and 4 warped in on location) while not needing to do an excessive amount of damage to be able to macro out of it afterwords.

In regards to actually macroing out of it, it's quite simple. Just start colossus production as your harassment is going on so that way if he tries to counter attack if the attack is held then you'll have something to defend a 3rd base easily. You should also try to squeeze in a few sentries if you notice the attack won't benefit from any additional warp ins.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Reaper FE with mine drop to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE gets out a fast Factory so that you can defend any early Protoss pressure with Widow Mines and Bunkers. It then transitions into standard Bio play for a 10 minute Medivac attack.

Scouting

The very beginning of this build is somewhat fragile (opening with a Reaper FE means that you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper.  Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they expand (or note if they do not get a fast expansion by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play as you sacrifice your Reaper into your opponents base. If you are playing against a 1 basing Protoss, then constantly produce Widow Mines  do not just stop at 1. Also, if you do not know whether or not your opponent has built a Stargate, building a Bunker in your main mineral line for 4 Marines to sit in and shoot any early game Oracles is not a bad idea too.

Push out when your first set of Medivacs finish (@10:10ish) with 3 Medivacs, around 6 Marauders and 26 Marines, and 53 SCVs at home

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and Medivacs. After this build, get Concussive Shells, take a 3rd Command Center, continue your upgrades by getting and Armory and another Engineering Bay, build 2 more Barracks, and react to whatever midgame splash damage your opponent is getting. Against Colossi, get a 2nd Starport; against Storm, get a Ghost Academy.

Tips

- If you are not comfortable with pulling SCVs in and out of gas, then simply ignore the two notes telling you to pull an SCV out of and then later put one more into gas (at 15 and 22 supply).
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper.  Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), then continue making Widow Mines.  Also, consider moving your natural to your main base and defending on one base.
- Oracles massacre un-upgraded Marines, so position your Widow Mines effectively.  Also consider adding a Bunker in your mineral line if your opponent has a Stargate to further defend Oracle pressure.
- If your opponent is not playing aggressively, then drop your Widow Mine(s) and Marines at your opponents base.  Do not over commit if your opponent already has a detection/Cannons ready for you.
- This build gives you enough gas to start Marauder production much earlier than most other builds.  Be sure to ramp up your Marauder production early in order to make a beefier army than your opponent.
- Move out as soon as your Medivacs pop.  Stimpack, while not yet done, should finish by the time you get to your opponents base.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because it gives you the economy and infrastructure on par with a Wings of Liberty style 1rax FE. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Not to mention the fact that you start Widow Mine production very early in order to stay safe against any potential Protoss aggression.

However, this build is somewhat vulnerable to early Protoss pokes, especially if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that you start Stimpack a little later than other builds that go directly for Stimpack research, but you will still have Stimpack done for the 10 minute Medivac timing.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Bunker,SCV,DoubleMarines,GasScv,Factory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,Starport,WidowMine,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Medivac,CallMule,DoubleMarines,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Refinery,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnStarport,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,EngineeringBay,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,ScannerSweep,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,LiftStarportFromTechLab,LandRaxOnTechLab,LandRaxOnTechLab,StimPack,CombatShield,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnStarport,CallMule,SupplyDepot,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMedivacs,Marauder,CallMule,DoubleMarines,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Marauder,DoubleMarines,Marauder', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:22:10 PM;

This safe fast expand build opens with a 1gate FE and then transitions into Colossi and double upgrades as fast as possible in order to go into the late game with an upgrade and tech advantage over a Terran opponent.

Benchmark: @100% +1/+1 (@10:30ish), you should have around 55 Probes, 1 Sentry, and 2 Colossi.

Scouting

This is a very safe macro build, getting you enough units in the early game for scouting or defensive purposes, so Probe scouting is usually unnecessary.  If your opponent sends a Reaper at your base, then be defensive with your initial Zealot/Stalker, and use only your Mothership Core to scout around.  If your opponent does NOT send a Reaper at your base, then poke out with your initial Zealot/Stalker and later Mothership Core to poke at your opponent?s front and glean some information about their build.

While your early game is completely safe, therefore making Probe scouting irrelevant, the early midgame is not, and thus scouting is crucial. If you know that your opponent is going for a Widow Mine drop, then get out Observers and several more Stalkers and place them defensively in each mineral line. Be prepared to use the Mothership Core?s Photon Overcharge on whichever Nexus your opponent chooses to drop. Delay Colossus tech in order to favor more units to deal with the harass. This same reaction works against all early drop-based or Banshee play. Against any early frontal assaults, simply Planetary Nexus your natural expansion and warp-in several more units.

Transitions

This build is quite macro-oriented, so playing for the long-game is crucial.  Against standard Bio play, Bio/Mine play, or Bio/Hellbat play, take your third base after your 3rd Colossus and transition into Chargelots, Archons, and Storm. Add more Gateways as your minerals permit. Also, Blink is a good upgrade to prioritize against heavy drop play on maps with a large distance between your main and third bases.

Against Mech play, take your third base and begin heavy Immortal production.  Make Immortals, Archons, and High Templar while on 3 bases, and focus on hitting a +3/+3 timing attack before your opponent is maxed.  Add more Robotics Facilities as your gas permits.

Pros and Cons

This build stays safe against early shenanigans as you macro up and tech straight for Colossus and +1/+1. It also gives you the infrastructure necessary to defend early drops or harassment common in this matchup.  With your upgrade lead and tech advantage, you can safely transition into the lategame by safely taking another base and going for Storm.

Tips

- Chronoboost your initial Nexus to get out as many probes as early as possible to kick start your economy.
- Use your initial units defensively if you spot a Reaper, or aggressively to scout your opponent?s base if no Reaper appears at your door by the time your Stalker has popped.
- Send your first Observer directly to your opponent?s base in order to see if he?s opening with fast Widow Mines/harassing units, or teching up to a normal Bio timing. Only warp-in units before you get your first Colossus out if you scout your opponent playing aggressively. Delay your Colossus tech and production if you spot your opponent going for a quick drop or early attack play. Instead, focus on making Gateway units and Observers and placing them defensively to maintain your economic advantage. However, if your opponent is NOT attacking early, always prioritize economy and teching up over making Gateway units
- Never underestimate the power of making your Nexus a Planetary Nexus.  At the very least, it is a way to scare off a drop from doing economic damage if your army is out of position.
- Against early drops, target firing the Medivac with your Stalkers and Planetary Nexus can mean the difference between letting your opponent escape and crushing a poorly planned drop.
- Don?t forget to use your Mothership Core?s Time Warp spell against any 2 base Bio timings in order to keep your Colossus safe.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Zealot,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,Chronoboost,WarpgateUpgrade,Probe,Probe,Probe,Nexus,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Pylon,Probe,RoboticsFacility,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Observer,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Observer,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,RoboticsBay,Probe,Chronoboost,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Forge,Forge,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,GroundWeaponsLevel1,GroundArmorLevel1,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,ExtendedThermalLance,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,TwilightCouncil,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:22:10 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'SaSe DT Rush', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This DT rush opens with a 3 Stalker Rush for safety and map control, and then gets out fast DTs either for offense (taking advantage of your opponent?s possible lack of detection early on) or defense (applying pressure while you safely take an expansion of your own).

Scouting

This build is a pretty unsafe build in general, only giving you 3-5 units for the early game timings, thus scouting is huge. However, because this build was created by SaSe, you are also low on minerals for quite some time and thus cannot afford losing mining time by scouting with a Probe.  Therefore, in the early game merely scout in your base for a proxy Gateway with the Probe who builds the 2nd Pylon; the rest of your scouting will come from your 3 Stalkers. Being active with these 3 Stalkers around your natural, third, and watchtower will prevent your opponent from sneaking proxy Pylons past you and hitting you with a very early Gateway attack. Thus, you will be able to see an incoming push coming before it?s too late, and can delay/cancel your fast expand in favor of more units if you need to.

Transitions

This build transitions very smoothly into Chargelot/Archon builds or Blink Stalker builds. To make either transition, first resume chronoboosting out probes from both Nexi and then start your research of choice (Charge or Blink). Adding on 2 more Gateways, and applying midgame pressure with lots of Gateways and 1 or 2 Archons is a great way to force units out of your opponent, scout what midgame tech he?s going, and possibly end the game if your DTs did too much damage.

Pros and Cons

This build is great because it gets a reasonably timed expansion, gives you DTs early for map control and potential game-ending damage, and lets you transition into an aggressive midgame with either Chargelots or Blink Stalkers at the core of your army composition.
However, this build is very weak vs Oracle openers, for they give both detection and a great way to harass your naked mineral line. Also, against early attacks that hit before your Dark Shrine finishes, if you miss the proxy Pylon because you are not active enough with your first three stalkers, you can straight up lose the game.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'sOs Hallucination 3gate Blink', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'This build is a much safer variant of blink and can respond to absolutely any build they would go for. The build stays defensive with the early units and MSCore so that you don't die to any sort of proxies/cheese and then uses a 5:45 hallucination to scout exactly what tech they're going for.

With this build DTs are a tad tricky though, so I added in my own little idea to stay safe vs them. At 6:00 is when you normally drop a robo to be safe vs DTs in a standard blink/obs build, however the hallucination scout doesn't normally get into their base until 20-30 seconds after that time has passed. This can lead to straight up losses due to not having a robo up in time. So since you have the money to make the robo at 6:00 still with this build it's a good idea to make it incase of DTs (especially if your early probe scout sniffed out DT tech) and then once your hallucination scouts their base you can cancel it if you see no evidence of DTs being made and react accordingly. You can also keep it if you want and do an even safer version of the build, however it will hinder your aggressive options and delay your nexus a bit.

If they go stargate then you can easily drop a 4th gate and go all in with blink. Be sure to leave the MSCore home to defend against oracles and use the hallucination from the sentry a 2nd time to get vision into their main to blink in there and catch them by surprise.

If they go blink as well then you'll need to gauge the situation. It's best to just make some stalkers and keep some form of map presence as you can and then expand behind it while getting a robo. This is where keeping the 6 minute robo is an OK decision because then you can go into immortals faster for a more defensive option incase he decides to all in with blink. There's also the off chance that they hid the dark shrine and you don't see it so keeping the robo after seeing a twilight only is still fine.

The cool thing with this build that CranK told me to do is to proxy a stargate for an oracle if you see them open greedier than you. This makes perfect sense since the only real downside to opening macro blink builds is that it's hard to pressure them and get ahead if they open for a greedier build than you. The initial blink stalkers will force them into stopping probes and going defensive for fear of a blink all in, however in the mean time an oracle is being made close to their base. They most likely will use overcharge at their natural as well so the main is left completely undefended for the oracle. All this time you were making probes and expanding yourself and all of a sudden you're on even footing once more. You can also take a greedier 3rd base since the oracle/blink combo will keep them on the defensive even more so than any other normal build.

Once you get your expansion up you can continue in whatever way you please whether that be with a fast +2 chargelot/immortal/archon all in or with standard colossus play.

5:45Send hallucination to scout

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Scarlett Macro Mutalisk Style', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

The definitive macro build of modern ZvT, Scarlett?s fast 3 Hatch style quickly transitions into the most commonly used composition of Zergling, Baneling, Mutalisk. Utilizing a gasless opener with a high Queen count and fast upgrades, this is by far the best build with which to learn ZvT.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of very early force, make a few Zerglings to stay safe. However, do NOT overproduce early game units because this will slow down your 3 base saturation, and thus your midgame strength. Your next scout will be with an Overlord just after you start your +1/+1 (@7:15ish). This is merely to scout whether your opponent is opening with 3 base Bio play, 3 base Mech play, or a 2 base timing. If your opponent is going Mech, immediately abandon this build. Zerglings and Banelings are highly ineffective against Hellbats, Hellions, and Siege Tanks, so begin violently tech switching based off of Terran?s composition; Mutalisks for Tanks, Swarm Hosts for Hellbat Thor, etc. Continuing Mutalisk production is fine, but be sure to take a much earlier 5th base and Infestation Pit, as well as a Roach Warren. If your opponent is opening bio, proceed as the build dictates.

Transitions

As soon as you confirm that your opponent is going for a 3rd Command Center, feel free to start your 4th Hatchery. Against Mech play, transitioning into Swarm Hosts, Mutalisks, or Vipers is very strong. Against Bio/Mine play, transitioning into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk or mass Zergling/Baneling is also quite strong. Assuming you have not scouted Mech, your transition into standard Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk should serve you fine against any bio based composition. Emphasize Zerglings against Bio/Mine, Banelings against Bio/Hellbat, and Mutalisks against Marine/Tank.

Tips

- Be sure that you take map control with your initial Zerglings. Being able to spot when and with what your opponent moves out on the map can be crucial in defending any early timings.
- Metabolic Boost will not finish until just before 8 minutes with this build. If your opponent is hitting you very early, then a Spine Crawler and/or extra Queens will be more useful than slow Zerglings.
- As above, beware Reapers pressuring the Drone that attempts to take your 3rd base. You will have to defend it cautiously with Queens and your slower Zerglings. This is where creep spread will greatly assist you.
- Just after you start your +1/+1 upgrades, be sure to send a sacrificial Overlord into your opponent?s base to check whether your opponent is going for a Mech or Bio build.
- Against a Banshee based opener, over-produce Queens and conserve energy for Transfuses, without compromising either your creep spread or your injects too much.
- Be aware of the flow of each Terran composition. For example, Bio/Mine typically means non stop aggression, so usage of static defense to buy time and Mutalisks to intercept reinforcements is critical.
- Mutalisks are prioritized in this build over the other two components; Zerglings and Banelings. It is important to be as active with them as possible without compromising your macro.
- Against Bio/Mine, engage in small groups whenever possible to abuse the long cooldown of Widow Mines to the maximum effect.
- Against Bio/Hellbat/Thor, be sure to emphasize a ground army instead of a Mutalisk based composition. More Banelings and a faster hive are highly recommended, and be sure to fight on creep to get the best possible Baneling connections.
- Be aware of the standard creep clearing push that every bio Terran executes between 10 to 12 minutes, using their first two Medivacs, 15 to 25 Marines with Combat Shield/Stimpack, and the survivors of the Reaper/Hellion squad; be sure to have Banelings ready to defend, and surrender non essential creep tumors (any tumors placed upon paths he will not attack on).
- Using the Mutalisks to deny the fourth base as long as possible is critical to victory. Because you have made so many Mutalisks, your own Hive Tech will be delayed, so you must delay Terran as long as possible in turn.
- The build gets looser and more flexible as the game goes on, as is to be expected. As you are first trying out this build, you will either be far too greedy, and die with too many Drones, or far too safe, and die with not enough Drones. Constantly adjust the ratio of Drones to units based upon what you scout and the flow of the game, and learn the precise moments when you are completely free to Drone, and when you are not to maximize your success with this build.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong against almost all standard Terran openers. It gets 4 Queens for safety, injects, creep spread, and to defend a very quick 3rd Hatchery. With such a fast third, your midgame economy is also quite solid. This build is also currently viewed as the best way to play macro ZvT. It has no inherent weaknesses, and thus will always guarantee that the better player wins the game.
However, because you delay your Extractors in favor of 4 Queens, this build is not as safe against 1 Base all-ins than an opener that gets a very fast Metabolic Boost. Additionally, because you are opening gasless, Reaper openers have to be defended purely with Queens and your Terran opponent may be more inclined to play much greedier than he normally would against a gas opener.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Queen,InjectLarva,Queen,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Hatchery,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Overlord,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,EvolutionChamber,EvolutionChamber,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,MeleeAttacksLevel1,GroundCarapaceLevel1,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Lair,SpawnCreepTumor,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,BanelingNest,Drone,Hatchery,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Spire,PneumatizedCarapace,Hatchery,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,CentrifugalHooks,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,MeleeAtacksLevel2,GroundCarapaceLevel2,Overseer,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,FlyerCarapaceLevel1,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:22:10 PM;

This build opens with the fastest possible Dark Templar in order to keep your opponent pinned in their base as well as some light harass, while you safely transition into a 2 base economy and either a Robotics or Blink focused play.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker back to the protection of your Mothership Core quickly if you have to defend an early attack. Hold on with Photon Overcharge until you can warp-in a DT to defend as well as harass.

This build is surprisingly safe against most openings, so scouting is pretty minimal.

Against standard Robo expand builds, your Nexus will be a little bit later.  You can make up for this either by using Warp Prism/DT harass or doing a Blink follow up to abuse their low production capability.

Against Blink play, simply take advantage of their lack of detection and kill a bunch of Probes. Against Dark Templar play, use your Observer and Stalker to push back their DTs while your(s) kill a bunch of Probes.

Against Stargate play, you might run into some problems. Phoenix will be able to scout what you are doing, and Oracles provide detection as well as harass potential.

Transitions

This build sets you up with a 2 base economy and both a Robotics Facility and Twilight Council. This lets you transition into either midgame Blink timings or Chargelot/Archon/Immortal macro play very easily.

To transition into Blink play, start and chronoboost Blink from your Twilight Council as soon as your first Dark Templar is warped in. Go up to 5 Gateways on 2 Assimilators and warp-in Blink Stalkers non-stop at your opponents base in order to punish typically greedy play in reaction to DT expand builds.

To transition into Chargelot/Archon/Immortal play, start Immortal production, a Forge, and go up to 3 Gateways. Once you are safely in the midgame, start Charge and be sure to out-expand your opponent.

Tips

- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial Stalker to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap?s 3gate All-in).
- You may want to proxy 2 Pylons with this build. One for the initial hidden Dark Shrine. The second for a close warp-in location for your initial DT.
- Un-chronoboosted Warpgate will time out perfectly with your Dark Shrine finishing
- Against Stargate play, be sure to position your initial units to defend your mineral line from potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- In the midgame, spend all of your Chronoboost on either the Robotics Facility or Twilight Council?depending on your transition.

Pros and Cons

This build is a reasonably safe build that allows you harass potential as well as forces your opponent to stay at home. It also expands at a normal time in order to get to the midgame quickly and transition smoothly into either a fast timing or macro play.

However, this build is somewhat weak against early Stargate play, for the Stargate allows for Oracles to both harass and detect and Phoenix to take map control.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,WarpgateUpgrade,MothershipCore,TwilightCouncil,Probe,Pylon,Probe,DarkShrine,Probe,Pylon,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Nexus,Probe,Observer,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,WarpInDarkTemplar', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:22:14 PM;

The build is a very straight forward 13 gate 15 double gas opener with3 on eachthat gets a Stargate right when the Cyber is done and then a MSCore for obvious reasons. Something that sOs doesn't do in his build is get an early stalker. I feel like it's a bit risky/greedy to do this and I feel more comfortable adding the stalker in, so I did. The small impact this has is that your 3rd phoenix will have a delay on it. It's not the biggest of deals in my opinion and I feel like it's better to feel safer with the early stalker to help try to scout for proxies and whatnot.

The robo comes early enough so that way DTs are not a problem at all. You'll easily be able to scout the dark shrine with your phoenix, the observer should come out right as the DT is getting to your base andyou can easily lift itand not lose a single unit. From there you'll have free reign over his probe line with your phoenix.

For the most part you should be getting your Nexus as early as possible right after the first warp in. Unless you think they're doing a 1 base all in there's no real reason to start the immortal before the nexus. In sOs' game vs Creator it seemed like he wasn't 100% certain if Creator was going to try and blink all in or not, so he played it safe and got the immortal before the nexus.

Reactions to certain builds

Early gateway timings

These are the only tricky things to stop with this build. Since you're not really making any units it's obvious that a 4gate might be a little hard to stop. The best thing you can really do is to identify that it's happening asap (with your probe scout) and prepare by getting3gates of your own and going intovoid rays. You'll have to use overcharge to buy timefor everything to finish and you'll need some fancy micro. Don't be afraid topull probes right awayto catch him off guard and get a surround off. Early probe pulls can be really good since their unit count isn't totally out of control and it can really swing the edge in your favor quickly since 4gates really only have 2 warp in cycles or so until they stop being effective. This will also force them to back away and allow your void ray to stay targeted for a while dealing out some extra damage. It'll have to be a dance, but it's definitely possible.

Stargate openers

It's really quite simple. If your stargate is faster than theirs and you get the phoenix out first, you should win easily. Take control of the skies and force them onto the ground and you can either follow up by taking an early nexus and harassing like normal, or throwing down 2 extra gates and try ending it with a phoenix/gateway all in. This is very effective since they will only have gateway tech available to them since the tech they invested in got shut down completely. If you get 4-5 phoenix and just lift up 4-5 units, all of a sudden half his army isn't in the fight and it's an easy win.

If their stargate is faster than yours, be sure to identify that right away. This stargate is basically the fastest possible off a normal opening, so the only thing faster than yours is an 11 gate stargate which you should be able to scout before you even drop you own stargate. So you canswitch to blinkif you want and go from there.

Blink openers

This is also quite simple since you are getting such a fast robo. Make sure to identify whether they're going for an all in or a macro build. If it's an all in, then simply start making immortals ASAP and chrono them out while using the phoenix to deny any high ground vision and just forcefield for days. They will probablytry to contain you, so keep the phoenix alive. Once you have a few immortals you canlift the sentriesthey have so you can bust down the ramp and force them away and take an expansion. Try to do this as early as possible so their expansion isn't too far ahead of yours and so they don't have like 3-4 sentries there.

Early robo expands

While they will have a faster expansion than you,you have full map control. This is where this build truly shines. Three phoenix can do wonders to a mineral line that's not easily defended. Even though their expansion will be quicker, it won't even matter because of the amount of damage you can do with your phoenix. The amount of resources required to defend 2 mineral lines from phoenix is a huge hit that early and it will really fuck with their timings for anything else. You can play completely greedy behind the phoenix and just chrono probes and get a quick forge and everything.You have full control of the gamein this situation.

Transition to mid game

Once you have your expansion then the rest is up to you really. The few things you 100% will need shortly after the nexus goes down are aforge, robo bay or twilight council, natural gasses.The build leaves you in control with the phoenix and gives you full scouting potential so it's very easy to react to what he's doing. Once you identify that they're going macro you need to put a forge down ASAP so you don't fall behind on upgrades. Shortly after that should be your tech of choice (whether it be colossi or twilight for immortal/archon). I personally prefer colossi since you already have the robo and it's a much quicker and safer transition. Twilight takes a little long and also diversifies your tech a little too much. You'll be spreading yourself too thin and if you realize that they're going to do some 2 base timing to kill you shortly after your nexus is up then you're going to have a hard time defending since you won't really have anything to defend with. From there you just play a standard macro PvP really.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Stargate,WarpgateUpgrade,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Pylon,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Phoenix,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Pylon,Phoenix,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Probe,Phoenix,Chronoboost,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,WarpInSentry,WarpInZealot,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Immortal,Chronoboost,Probe,Nexus', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:22:15 PM;

This build opens with some light Stalker pressure and then follows up with a 3gate Blink Stalker all-in, using the Mothership Core for high ground vision and Time Warp.

Blink into the main when Blink finishes (@7:40ish) with 12 Stalkers and 25 Probes at home.

Scouting

This build is an aggressive opener that makes a lot of units, so you will not have to worry about Probe scouting. Against Reaper play, keep your first Stalker on a common hop-up ledge in order to deny your opponent scouting the Twilight Council. Against other defensive play, poke out to your opponent?s front with your first Stalker and check to see whether your opponent is going for Widow Mines or a quick CC into Bio so you know how to micro when you Blink into his main base with all of your units.

Transitions

This build is an all-in, so there is no standard follow-up. If your attack does damage and you keep most of your units alive, then you can take a natural expansion and transition into Upgrades+Storm. However, if you do not do significant damage with your initial Stalkers and also lose them, you are most likely out of the game because your midgame tech and economy will be vastly behind that of your opponent.

Tips

- Do not bother Probe scouting, you can do this build against nearly everything your opponent chooses to open with.
- With your initial Stalkers, either protect your main base from a Reaper scouting your Twilight Council or move out and poke up at your opponent?s base for some early scouting intel.
- The limiting factor with this build is Blink Research?s build time, so be sure to Chronoboost that Research constantly in order to attack as soon as possible.
- Keep your Mothership Core out of harm?s way. Use its 14 sight range for high ground vision, but do not commit the Mothership Core in the attack because without high ground vision, your attack will most likely fail.
- Do not forget to use your Mothership Core?s Time Warp ability to help pick off SCVs or Bio units that are out of position.
- Do NOT over-commit your Stalkers in a risky blink. Only aggressively blink to get up to a high ground or to pick off a Siege Tank/Widow Mine before it activates.
- Constantly warping-in more Stalkers to reinforce your army and add strength to the attack is key to crushing through your opponent?s defenses.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong build because of how quickly you get both high ground vision with your Mothership Core and enough Blink Stalkers to do real damage.

However, this build is in fact an all-in, so there is no standard transition should the attack fail. Also, if your Stalker positioning is sub-optimal, a Reaper may scout your Twilight Council and reveal the build before you have even moved out to attack.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Stalker,TwilightCouncil,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Stalker,Blink,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,MothershipCore,Pylon,Gateway,Gateway,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:22:10 PM;

This Speedling all-in is a cheese designed to hard and blind-counter a Gateway Expanding Protoss player in the current metagame. It also has varying success against a FFE, depending on your opponent?s building placement.

Scouting

You only need to Drone scout for the Protoss on a 4 player map such as Whirlwind or Red City. Your early Spawning Pool prevents you from having the minerals to scout with a Drone on any other map. Instead of scouting with your units, the vast majority of your scouting will come from your initial Overlords? vision. Also, you do not need to scout for any Protoss cheeses because cheese should counter any of their cheeses quite effectively.

Transitions

Because this build is straight-up cheese, there is no true transition to this build. However, if you do damage and want to continue into a macro game, take a natural Hatchery and start a 2nd Queen to play a 2base, map control play style.

Tips

- Position your Overlords to give you vision of your opponent?s walls. Attacking the holes in your opponent?s building placement is crucial with this build, but that can only be easily done once you have vision of these holes.
- Use your initial 6 Zerglings to do as much damage as possible, along with scouting the Protoss for unusual play.
Avoid placing your Zerglings in a position where they can be surrounded by Probes and/or Zealots. Always retreat and poke in another area instead of committing to a bad position to get a guaranteed kill on a single target.
- Avoid a-clicking with your Zerglings. Rather, pick a target, move behind it to surround it, and then attack-move or target-fire the individual unit for a quick kill.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any Protoss player going for a Gateway Expand (the current metagame).  It is designed to do potentially game-winning damage against any player with sub-optimal building placement and Probe control.
However, it is significantly weaker against a Forge Fast Expanding player, for your Zerglings can only do damage where there are no Photon Cannons or wall-offs.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Extractor,Drone,Overlord,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn5Seconds,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MetabolicBoost,Queen,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:22:15 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Stats 11gate 3gate into DT', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'Build starts with an 11 gate. The 11 gate gets out a fast chronoboosted stalker and if your opponent isn't paying attention (most of the time they aren't) you'll be able to kill their scouting probe with the stalker and keep them completely in the dark. With that first stalker you can then easily take watch towers and look around the map to find any other hidden probes they may send out, or even catch the MSCore across the map if they try to scout you that way. The 11gate stalker really gives you a lot ofearly game map control so please use that to its advantage.

The attack itself should go pretty normally. Use the first stalker to poke up a bit after you scout around the map. This will let you know if they expanded early or not. Don't fully commit until you have both stalkers though (especially against double gate openers) since it's pretty easy to get caught out with it. The fact that you're 3gating and that you're making stalkers will really trip your opponent off. The last thing on their mind will be DTs hitting with the next warp in. So be sure to get stalkers instead of zealots. You'll have enough gas even while making stalkers so don't think you won't be able to warp them in with 2 rounds of stalkers.

One tricky thing to deal with is proxy oracle. Since this build skips the MSCore you won't have any defense back at home while you're doing your attack. The key to stopping this is scouting. You need to identify that he's proxying SOMETHING as soon as you can. If you only see one pylon in his base with your probe scout then that's enough. You'll need to deviate your build completely and go purely defensive. The first chronodstalker should be sent to look for the proxy. If you find it early enough you can actually depower the stargate before the oracle gets out. The next thing you need is astargate right when you have 150 gasafter the stalker. You can then get warp get and a 2nd stalker and chrono the 2nd stalker as well. You can decide to send the 2nd stalker to the proxy if you find it quick enough to try and keep it depowered or you can leave it home for extra defense if you don't feel like risking it. When the stargate is done you make a phoenix and chronoboost it and it will finish just as the oracle is coming into your base. If you depower the stargate then that's even better cause you can sometimes even fit in 2 phoenix before the oracle comes out. From there you can either do a 3gate phoenix all in to kill them, or just get 3 phoenix for harassment while getting a robo and expanding. If they go for blink after the oracle (which is pretty common) then you're going to want to do the 3 phoenix and robo response.

If you sniff out them doing a DT opener (1 gate, using all chrono, no signs of pressure at all, maybe find their probe trying to be sneaky and hide a pylon which will be a huge trigger since they opened so passively, see that a robo is finishing up as you start your pressure meaning he went DT/robo etc.) then you need tohide a robo on the map ASAPand also try to target their robo. If you notice it finishing as you start your pressure then you can kill it with the stalkers/DTs before an obs comes out. This is situational though as they may have sentries to FF it or have it tucked away where you can't reach it. If you can't kill the robo then just try to depower it or go straight for probes.

Pretty much any other opener and you'll be able to win with the aggression straight up.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Taeja Autoturret Doom Drop', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

Though it has fallen out of popularity, this once dominant build still remains as powerful as ever. Utilizing a gas first opening to stay safe against an opponents gas first aggression, this build gets a fast two Medivacs to violently drop 8 Marines, 2 Siege Tanks, and 3 Auto Turrets in a critical position of the enemys base.

Scouting

Taeja chooses only to scout with his Hellion, preserving all his SCVs for maximum income. At times, he cannot afford continuous Marine or SCV production in the demonstration replay; had he SCV scouted he would be even more pushed for minerals.

SCV scouting is definitely an option if you do not feel safe enough with the delayed hellion scout, but it should be relegated to a 4:30 scout at the very earliest so as to not delay your Starport in any way.

Transitions

This build can transition into both Bio or Mech. Because you have made no major investments down either tech path, and you have exactly one of each necessary production structure, you can literally go into whatever style you want.

Tips

Against a live resisting opponent, execution of this build may run into some problems. They could be opening banshees; forcing Turrets to be made just before you move out. They could be doing the exact same build, resulting in a base trade. They could be doing earlier aggression that pins you in your base for longer than youd like, such as an elevator attack or a doom drop.

There are reactions to each of these plays, and there are far too many to list here. Regardless of what happens though, sometimes it is important to identify that you are more ahead simply by staying home and defending, and not to blindly commit to the attack every single game. This will come by experience and repeatedly executing the build.

Three main consistencies must be maintained;

1) You MUST continue unit production behind this attack; you cannot start a big transition (adding on Barracks/Factories while freezing production by constructing addons) else you will be extremely vulnerable to a counter attack. The only exception is when you know with certainty that your opponent will not be performing some sort of counterattack (for example, he has gone 3 Barracks into delayed Factory, or he has gone for a elevator and youve already killed the medivacs beforehand).

2) Once your autoturrets are dropped, its almost always a good idea to fly the Raven home; it will prove useful in the mid game.

3) If they made Banshees, you have to make turrets before moving out, else risk losing the game. Delay this to the last possible moment, as you are already pressed for cash.

Pros and Cons

The lethality of this build cannot be understated; you can simply win most games with this drop, especially against players who have gone for more macro oriented builds, such as a Reaper FE or a 15 gas style.

Unfortunately, if your opponent identifies your build quickly enough and prepositions his units properly, or employs defensive AOE such as Tanks or Widow Mines, your drop may end up doing little to no damage, and you can easily die to a counter push or drop.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,SCV,Factory,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Starport,Refinery,SCV,TechLabOnFactory,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,Hellion,SCV,LandStarportOnTechLab,Raven,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,LiftStarportFromTechLab,LandFactoryOnTechLab,SiegeTank,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,Medivac,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SiegeTank,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Medivac,SCV,OrbitalCommand', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:22:15 PM;

This aggressive build used by Liquid`TaeJa and many other top level Korean Terrans opens with a very standard Banshee build adapted to Heart of the Swarm and the cheaper Banshee Cloak upgrade. The Banshees are used to stay safe against early attacks as well as harass your opponent.

This build is VERY closely related to Polts Gas First Banshee Build  TaeJas version is just a Barracks first variant of Polts build.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your 1st Refinery to check whether or not your opponent is opening with Reapers. Against an opponent opening Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe; thus, you should try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or expanded at your natural with your first few Marines.

Your next scout will come with your Banshee. With this Banshee, you can check what your opponents opener is. Against another Banshee player, follow-up your first Banshee with a Raven (and then potentially Viking if extra anti-air is needed). Against a Hellbat dropping player, make a few Widow Mines to burrow defensively against any incoming drop, as you use several Banshees to out-harass him. Against a player going for a Widow Mine Drop, position your Marines defensively at home and be sure to have enough scans to deal with his Widow Mines. Building a Raven might be useful, but not until after you have 2 Banshees with which to harass your opponent.

Finally, be sure to keep an eye out on what midgame transition your opponent is doing. Look for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either all-in, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play quite easily.

For an all-in transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory and start Siege Tank production instantly. When you hit 2 or 3 Siege Tanks, grab all of your Marines (>20), your Banshees/Vikings, and attempt to break your opponents front with a slow siege push.

It is possible to go into Marine/Tank or Mech after a 3 Command Center follow-up if you are sure your opponent will not be going for any more early game pressure. Start a Raven in order to save enough minerals to afford 2 Command Centers and then transition into either Marine/Tank or Mech just as below.

When transitioning into macro Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production after you start a 2nd Command Center. That way you have enough defense early and later can have a strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy Siege Tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use.
- Watch for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop your Banshee as you enter your opponents base.  Cloak your Banshee as soon as you see any potential for burrowed Widow Mines.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that are undefended by a Turret.  If you are transitioning to a 1/1/1 all-in, then be sure to target-fire Marines as well.
- Always favor keeping your Banshee(s) alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two. You can also repair a weakened Banshee at home with SCVs if you can keep it alive.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural. You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This build is a standard, aggressive opener in TvT that both scouts and stays safe in the early game. Also, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for you are able to transition into an all-in, 3 Command Center play, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play. Also, this build requires a lot less APM than other TvT builds, so it can be very useful for lower league players.

However, this build is not quite as effective at killing workers as a Widow Mine Drop into Banshee build. Also, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind your opponent in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades, especially if they open with a fast expansion. Finally, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,Factory,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Refinery,SCV,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Starport,ReactorOnBarracks,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,CallMule,SCV,LandStarportOnTechLab,CloakingField,DoubleMarines,Banshee,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:22:15 PM;

You do a normal gate FE and then get 2 gates and a sentry to keep safe vs anything they could possibly throw at you early and then get the stargate with the next 150 gas and make an oracle out of it for any initial drone damage as well as scouting. It isEXTREMELY important you DO NOT lose the oracle. It is more of ascouting unitthan it is a harassing unit in this build. You aren't getting a robo for observers and you aren't getting a high sentry count for hallucinations so the oracle is your only means of map control. If you wanna try being risky with the oracle to snag a few drone kills here or there that you think you might not get away with, then decide against it and keep the oracle alive instead.

After the oracle you go intonon stop void ray production.

Mid game transition/Reations

From the 3rd base you get 2 more stargates and +1 Air to round out your mass void rays. There are a couple things the zerg might do that would require you to do a different response than non stop void ray until like the 20th minute.

Hydra/Ling Pushes

So this is what I think is the most difficult to stop with this exact build. Since it focuses so much on void rays and so little on gateway units it seems it would be a bit awkward to hold hydra/ling. This is why the oracle is so important because you need to identify this is happening as soon as possible. You'll need more zealots and 1 or 2 more sentries. Keep making void rays as much as you can. You might need to only do 1 extra stargate instead of 2 to be able to keep your gateway production up. You can also get extra cannons by your 3rd to help defend. What you want to be doing is segmenting his army up in tiny tiny bite size chunks. Keep as much of his hydra army away from you as possible. Just stall and delay as much as possible until you get a decent void ray/gateway count up and just splitting off chunks of his army. It's a very fragile and patient game that you must play. From there it's best to go into twilight council and storm/charge earlier if he continues to mass hydra. If he goes swarm host after then you can keep going SkyToss.

Burrowed Roaches

This is a style some zergs like to use vs fast 3rds off of a stargate. Since your units are so slow and you don't have as many of them (compared to +2/blink openers) he just masses roaches and burrows them all over your 3 bases and widdles you down. If you notice he's doing this then you're going to needextra cannons in each baseto cover important areas. You should alsobring your oracle home for revelationsince you won't have an observer. Basically if you see it early enough you should be fine since you can spam cannons and void rays.

Roach/Hydra/Viper

This also elicits the faster twilight response. If you notice him rushing to hive after a passive roach hydra opener (or any roach hydra opener really) thenyou NEED HT's to feedback the vipers. If they do the really fast version of this then you won't be at your critical mass of void rays yet and he'll be able to pull them all out of position over top his army. So you just need to transition into charge/HT faster.

Mutas

Simple enough. Scout that he's going spire and make phoenix instead of void rays.

Late Game

So if he's just being passive and letting you do whatever you want (aka making only void rays) be it with either swarm hosts or whatever, then you want to be going around the map with void ray hit squads to try and snipe hatcheries. This is what Protoss used to do back in 2013 when void ray/HT was popular. You go out with your voids and MSCore and try to snipe hatches since they DPS them down so quickly, and then recall back.

If he's being passive you eventually want to still go into twilight for DT harass and storm. If you want to go ahead and mass carriers then by all means go ahead and mass carriers. If you wanna be a little safer and more traditional, then go for faster storm. Just defend, defend, defend and react to any tech switches from zerg and then take the golden fight when you find it. It's a relatively simple game plan, but still fragile if caught out before you get the carriers out. Since you have such a high void ray count though (like 20) then it should deter the zerg from trying to actually engage you.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,GoOutProbe,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Nexus,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Pylon,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Sentry,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Probe,Stargate,Probe,Probe,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Oracle,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Forge,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,VoidRay,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,GroundWeaponsLevel1,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,WarpInSentry,Probe,Probe,Nexus,VoidRay,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,WarpInSentry,WarpInSentry,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,VoidRay,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Stargate,Stargate', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:22:15 PM;

This build opens with an economic 2 base Muta opener, and uses a 7:20 Overlord scout coupled with the initial Mutalisk harass to determine whether your Terran opponent is using a Bio-based composition, or a Mech-based composition.

Scouting

Scout first with your 2 initial Zerglings, use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of the Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of force very early, you will probably need emergency Spine Crawlers ? your Metabolic Boost will only be finishing around 8:20!
Your next scout will be with an Overlord as soon as your Lair finishes (around 7:05).  With this scout, aim to check if your opponent is playing Mech or Bio. Seeing any of the following can indicate Mech play: an Armory, more than 1 Factory, a Factory with Tech Lab, a lack of Barracks, or a lack of add-ons on Barracks. Seeing any of the following can indicate Bio play: 2 Engineering Bays, a Barracks with a researching Tech lab, more than 1 Barracks, or only one Factory.  If you scout Bio, you can still continue with a 2 base Spire timing and transition into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk OR you can abort the 2 base Spire timing and throw down 2 Evolution Chambers as soon as possible for +1/+1 Melee/Carapace upgrades.
The next scout will be with your initial Mutalisks. Terran will be forced to defend himself with his units, so you?ll see either Bio or Mech units to defend. These Mutalisks should be able to get into his main quite easily and scout what type of production he is using, perhaps even doing some economic damage.

Transitions

If you confirm Mech play with your Mutalisks, throw down an Infestation Pit. If you are sure he is going Mech before your Mutalisks arrive, then you can even place the Infestation Pit as soon as your Mutalisks hatch. Add more bases and Swarm Hosts when you can afford them.  Swarm Hosts are a strong option as your initial Mutalisks will likely force Turrets, Thors, and Widow Mines?units that are generally not strong against Swarm Host play. Alternatively, you can go into Overlord Speed and drop-play, to abuse the lack of Terran mobility. Finally, you can also place your Hive as soon as possible and go for a follow-up Brood Lord transition.
If you confirm Bio play with your Mutalisks, throw down 2 Evolution Chambers and a Baneling Nest as soon as possible. Note that you will be behind in upgrades against a 3 base macro Terran player, but you can recuperate this loss by aiming to snipe a key Tech lab researching Stimpack or Combat Shields, as this can prevent Terran from being aggressive with his upgrade lead. Good creep spread and strong engagements/burrowed Banelings can also mitigate this upgrade deficit. Once you hit the lategame, you have the option to transition into your preferred Hive tech.

Tips

- If you place a 5:00-5:30 Spine Crawler, you should be able to stop Hellions made from a Factory started before your opponent?s 2nd base. A 6:00-6:30 Spine Crawler will finish in time to stop Hellions made after your opponent?s 2nd base or Hellions made after a Reaper opener.
- Just when your Lair finishes (7:20ish), ideally you should be fully saturated on your 2 bases with extra minerals going into additional Drones. However, there are a couple of defensive options available if you are under pressure: If you have extra Drones and want to completely deter Hellion runbys, then make a wall-off with 2 Evolution Chambers and your Spine Crawler at the front of your natural.This will not slow down your Mutalisk timing as long as you remain fully saturated on all mineral lines and Extractors. Alternatively, you also have the ability to make a large group of Zerglings (only if you need to defend yourself) without hurting the timing of the Mutalisks. Note that you should only do this if you absolutely have to because droning should always be a priority. Remember that Metabolic Boost will only finish around 8:20, so any Zerglings made before this point should be used strictly for defense.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against Mech players. The initial Mutalisks will force extra Missile Turrets, Thors, and Widow Mines ? units that are all not ideal against the large mass of Swarm Hosts that you should follow-up with.
If you scout your opponent opening Bio with your Mutalisk timing, then you can transition into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk. The obvious problem here is that you will be behind on upgrades, but again this is not game-ending provided you get strong, cost-efficient engagements on creep. Also, this build is vulnerable to large Marine attacks in the early-game because you will not have Metabolic Boost yet to defend them. Hopefully, however, you can scout this coming with your initial Zerglings and/or Overlord in order to stay safe with Spine Crawlers.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Queen,Overlord,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Lair,Extractor,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,MetabolicBoost,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Spire,Overlord,Overlord,Hatchery,Queen,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,SpawnCreepTumor,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:22:15 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Trap 5 Stalker rush 3 gate', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'This is a really cool flexible and versatile build. You can use it in many situations and have a good response for pretty much anything they could do. As evidence to that point, Trap used this exact same build 4 times in a row vs sOs at Redbull DC and won every time with it.

So the idea behind the build is that you do a 5 stalker rush early on to get maximum map control and pressure potential. After scouting basically everything on your side of the map you turn that control into aggression with a follow up 3 gate attack that hits quite early (~6:40) with an uncommon 8 stalkers. It' packs a much more powerful punch even though it hits slightly later than traditional 3gates due to the fact that it hits with so many stalkers. Most of the times when you go against an early expand build with a 3stalker rush 3gate you'll need the aid of an oracle to really close the deal since they'll be able to get immortals out. However since this hits so powerfully you can get a cancel on the nexus or even end the game. A very cool thing Trap did in game 1 vs sOs on King Sejong is that he went up the ramp with the first 3 stalkers to bait an overcharge from sOs in the main after seeing it was a fast expand. This allowed him free reign over the natural so he could easily kill it. It may not always be that easy but the potential is there.

If they go blink themselves then the hope is that you hit with so many stalkers so early that you can overwhelm them before they can get blink done. However if this isn't possible you should back off and try to expand earlier so you don't die when his blink is done. If they go blink/obs then you should be safe to expand since they won't be able to commit as hard, however if they go 4gate blink you can make a dark shrine instead of blink to kill them. Going for robo after such a late blink like this is risky as you have a huge window to die to a player who just masses only stalkers.

If they go stargate then you should kind of just win. Again, the initial 8 stalkers packs a powerful punch and if you can't end them early then the follow up blink will be a good plan B. Whether it be just to defend a 2nd base easier or to do a follow up all in with blink and 4gates.

If they go DTs you'll need to be able to sniff the build out. If you get a feeling that they might go DTs early then you can get a robo behind the 3gates instead of the twilight council to be safe. Or if you can poke early enough with your first 3 stalkers to get a second look to see if they're going DTs then you can cancel the twilight, make a robo and then warp in sentries at home to block the ramp. You might need to bring your 4th and 5th stalker back to hold position on the ramp as well to buy more time.

If they go for a very fast robo after an expansion you can also proxy a stargate (or just make one in base) after the twilight finishes (don't research blink) or after canceling the twilight. It's a similar response to how you deal with fast expands with thesOs build I did last PvP.Trap nearly kills sOs with the initial 3gate, however gets the stargate anyway which ends up finishing the deal. So even though it's quite late it still does the job well.

Now the other cool thing with this build is that it has a fast expand variant. The build ends up lining up to be very similar to thesafe 2 gate expandthat I covered. The only difference is the double chronod stalkers and that the sentries come last and there's only 2 of them. The nexus and robo go down at identical times. So if you want you can easily learn this build and it'll be perfect in a best of series since you can open with either the aggressive option or defensive option and then switch it around the 2nd game to trick your opponent since it looks identical to them. If you want some more info on how to follow up the expansion then just check out the 2 gate safe expand write up since it's basically the same build.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,GoOutProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Stalker,WarpgateUpgrade,Chronoboost,MothershipCore,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,Chronoboost,Stalker,Chronoboost,Gateway,Stalker,Stalker,TwilightCouncil,Pylon,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon,Blink,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,WarpInSentry,Pylon,Probe,WarpInSentry,Probe,Probe,Nexus', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:22:15 PM;

This is a fun build. Not many people are expecting DT drops anymore so they can do quite the damage to unprepared Terrans and lead you into a nice mid game with the colossus to defend and the warp prism to continue harassment for basically the whole game if you can keep it alive.

The opening is like a normal twilight opening with a 28 TC off of a normal 1 gate FE. There's a proxy pylon after the 2nd stalker to hide the dark shrine to make it easier to surprise the terran. If they get a reaper in or scan you can easily throw a chrono down on the TC to fake going blink. If you want you can warp the first DT in from your proxy pylon and send it across the map and then when your warp prism gets to their base the 2nd warp in will be ready, or you can just do it with the warp prism half way to his base and load it up and once more when you get there, either way it doesn't really matter.

The build also gets an early sentry after 2 stalkers to help defend vs any 3 rax aggression. In the sample video Trap uses a forcefield on the ramp to keep him from going up into the main and keeping him down by the overcharge. Even though he loses like 12 probes, the 3 rax commitment is so strong that your DT's will be able to do equal if not more damage than the 3 rax. This is especially true since they won't have turrets up since they have to delay their ebay for a long time when doing a 3rax. Their SCV count will also be low from the start. So even if you can't defend perfectly at your natural, make sure you can do a lot of damage with the DTs. Keep them alive as long as possible by picking them up out of scans with the warp prism etc.

Trap does a pretty greedy follow up after the DT opening. He goes into 2 forges instead of 2 gateways and gets a later robo bay as well. This is because he knows his DTs will be keeping Reality back so he can tech up like that, however if you want to play it safer then the follow up I provided will be much better for you. It gets the 2 extra gates at 8 minutes as well as the robo bay. A single forge comes slightly earlier. If you notice the terran went for earlier ebays then you can go for double forge. Play as greedy as you would like to.

From there you just make more gates around 9-10 minutes in anticipation for their mid game medivac pressure and take a 3rd base whenever you feel safe with blink and colossus while denying/harassing their 3rd with the warp prism.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,GoOutProbe,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Nexus,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,WarpgateUpgrade,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,TwilightCouncil,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,DarkShrine,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Chronoboost,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,WarpPrism,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,WarpInDarkTemplar,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,RoboticsBay,Probe,Probe,WarpInDarkTemplar,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Forge,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Colossus,ExtendedThermalLance,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,GroundArmorLevel1,Chronoboost,Chronoboost', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:22:16 PM;

This build is cool because it starts out with the most standard all around robo opening possible. So not only is it safe vs basically any opener the Terran can do,it looks totally standardand adds an extra bit of mind games on top of the fake all in. The 2 stalkers will keep you safe vs any sort of early pokes and if you see them doing a gas first opener then you just follow up with your normal response with the robo for observers and what not. I prefer following up with a DT drop after gas first openers, but you can still try to do the build after you defend as well.

The build skips gateways for a while so if he's doing any sort of really crazy aggressive push then you're banking on the immortals and overcharge to keep you alive.Don't be afraid to show the immortalsif you really need them to defend early on, because this build is all about mind games early on so them seeing the immortals is honestly not even that big of a deal because it can force them to go super defensive even earlier than normal which will only benefit you.

The fake attack + Mid game transition

So once warp gate is done you're gonna be warping in only sentries. Trap goes up to 5 which is a good amount where if the Terran sees that many they'll still think you're all inning but not so much that it hinders any chance of transition.

Now one more thing I should note about the push is that there is a vulnerability to 3 rax openings. Since your gate count comes in so late, if you move out on the map with only the first few units and they opened 3 rax then you're probably gonna get caught out and lose. So if you notice they open 3 rax while doing this build, juststart your move out after you warp in the sentries at homeinstead of going across right away. You might even need to defend with the immortals before you can attack if they go soon enough.

The transition is quite simple to pull off if you scare the terran. You get charge and the templar archives right when the twilight council is done andyou also continue making probes the entire timeyou were doing the fake attack. So by the time you're transitioning you'll be fully saturated. The transition is very easily defended because even if the terran doesn't fully buy into your fake attack, if they still try to attack themselves after then the 5 gates worth of units and 2 immortals you made is SO helpful in defending. 5 sentries do wonders to split up small amounts of bio and you should be just fine against any kind of counter pressure if they do it at all. You also get a warp prism after the observer so that if they do try to counter attack then you have a nice 4 zealot drop going on in their main at the same time.

From there just chrono the storm and try your best to keep it a secret. Storm is always great if they don't know about it for as long as possible. You can then come out of no where with 5+ HT's full of energy with them having no idea about it and you just get a free win.

Late game

If you don't get the eZ free win then you can just continue on like with any normal PvT opening. You can make a quick tech over to colossus since he will have identified the HT's late. This gives you extra time to transition over since he'll be setting up to go into anti HT mode for a while. If you can get the 3rd up and get storm out without taking any damage, you should be 100% fine to go into the later stages with a large tech advantage.

This build uses a fast +1 Carapace upgrade to secure a fast 3rd Base and deny opposing 3rds before it transitions into a swift +1/+1 Speed Roach timing and eventual +2/+1.

Scouting

In the early stages of the game, all scouting comes from Overlord vision, so be sure that you send your initial 2 Overlords towards your opponent?s natural expansion. You can use your Overlord to compare his Hatchery?s HP to yours, to determine what kind of opener he used. If his hatchery is stronger than yours, he has gone hatchery first. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is the same HP as yours, he has VERY LIKELY done the same build as you. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is weaker to yours, he has gone for a gas and pool before hatchery in some order, meaning his speed is quicker than yours. Banelings before speed in this scenario is often advised, and likely make the Baneling nest in the main to not lose your Baneling tech to mass Zerglings with speed. An alternative is to not use your Gas, and get extra Queens and 2-3 Spine Crawlers. The main theme here is to not get Speed first, as his WILL be quicker. You need to find an edge that isn?t using Zergling Speed.
When playing versus any very early aggression (<10 pool), use your Drones to defend until you have your own Zerglings, a Queen, and potentially a Spine Crawler. Consider canceling the Hatchery for more minerals. Also use your initial overlord to scout when your opponent is taking their natural Hatchery. Feel free to apply some light pressure with your first Zerglings against a Hatch first build, but do not let it mess up your macro.
Make sure you have 2 to 4 Zerglings out on the map at all times. Send your initial 2 Zerglings to your opponent?s base to spot what they have at the front, and if possible get into the main with 1 Ling to see whether your hatching Drones or Zerglings from their eggs. Use the scouting intel that these pokes give you to determine whether you should get Banelings and extra Zerglings to defend yourself or pressure your opponent, or whether you should continue droning.
If your scout Zerglings see Drones hatching, and no wall at the front, you can choose to make Drones OR Zerglings to pressure. If you scout Zerglings, and no wall at the front, you should make the same amount of Zerglings. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings escape, send them back in to scout in 20~ seconds. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings die, remake the scout. Consider another 2 Zerglings for just-in-case Banelings. If you scout a wall, the Zerg is likely playing passive and you are likely safe.
As soon as you are sure you are safe, transition into your choice of tech.

Transitions

This has best synergy with a Hydralisk transition, which is possible after taking gas numbers 5 and 6 at your third base, although you could flood earlier Speedlings with +1 Carapace. However, you have the option of simply researching +1 Melee upgrades to transition into upgraded Speedlings, which is excellent against Mutalisk openers, or even going for a delayed Spire.

Tips

If your opponent is also going for a Roach based composition, remember that Roach Battles are mostly determined by macro and concaves. The superior concave will allow a smaller force to defeat a larger one, for the most part ? this is because more Roaches can fight in a larger concave, although you can also rush forward to allow the ones in the back to attack.
Against a Mutalisk based player, be sure to scout to see how many Mutalisks your opponent is making. If he is only making a few Mutalisks to dictate the pace of the game and force spores, you will probably be able to get away with only making Queens and Spores. If your opponent is heavily committing to Mutalisks, then consider incorporating Hydralisks and Infestors earlier than you normally would, in addition to the standard Queens and Spores. Spore Crawlers should also be placed to cover your Extractors, to ensure you do not fall behind tech wise. Do not be afraid to delay your Roach Timing if you are not sure how your opponent is going to play it out.
Against an upgraded Speedling force, delay your timing until you are maxed out. If your opponent invests very heavily into melee and carapace upgrades, they are almost certainly transitioning into an Ultralisk focused composition.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very flexible opener, which can combat greedier defensive play and also more aggressive play if your defensive micro is strong.
Because you are opening +1 Carapace Speedlings, taking and defending your third should relatively straightforward. Additionally, you have the opportunity of being reactive; the infrastructure you have at Lair level (+1 Carapace, Roach Warren, Metabolic Boost) allow you to choose between +1/+1 Speedlings, +1+1 Roaches, or even a slightly delayed Mutalisk transition.
However, this build by default will skip the Baneling nest in favor of faster upgrades and Lair Tech, so it is important to be on point with your scouting to avoid dying to enemy Baneling/Speedling aggression. If your scouting is poor, consider opening instead with the Safe Ling/Bling Opener, which will teach you what to look for and give you the tools to defend with.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Overlord,Extractor,Drone,Queen,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Queen,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,EvolutionChamber,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GroundCarapaceLevel1,Hatchery,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Lair,InjectLarva,RoachWarren,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Extractor,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GlialReconstitution,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:22:16 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Trap 3gate All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This hyper-aggressive 3gate all-in opens with a Gateway on 10 supply in order to get the fastest Warpgate Research possible. It then hits a ridiculously early (@5:30ish) 3gate attack in order to end the game before leaving the early game.

Scouting

This build requires very minimal scouting, for you are placing your initial Gateway at 10 supply?long before any scouting information could influence your build. However, it is critical to send a Probe out to set up proxy Pylon(s) BEFORE your Warpgate is done. Thus, probe scouting to check whether your opponent has opened with a 3 Stalker Rush in order to deny proxy Pylons can yield useful information.

Transitions

This build is an all-in in every respect: getting a 10 Gateway, non-stop chronoboosting Warpgate, halting Probe production at 16 (on minerals), and dumping all money into Gateway units. Thus, there is no well-defined transition. If you are late in your execution and do not outright kill your opponent (or at least take out their army and 10+ Probes), then you will most likely lose the game to any sort of Robotics/Twilight/Stargate counter-attack.

Tips

- Use only 1 Chronoboost on Probes (as you resume Probe production after your 10 Gateway).
- Use 1 Chronoboost on your Zealot in order to finish it as your Cybernetics Core finishes.
- ALL THE REST OF YOUR CHRONOBOOST MUST BE DUMPED INTO WARPGATE RESEARCH. The limiting factor on this build is how fast you can finish Warpgate. Be sure to non-stop chronoboost your Cybernetics Core until it finishes researching so as to attack as early as possible.
- There is a slightly more aggressive/less economic version of this build that opens with a 15 Zealot, 17 Pylon, and never chronoboosts the Zealot. That build and this build can be used interchangeably based on personal preference.
- Place your proxy Pylons quite aggressively for your attack to hit as fast as possible, unless you need to hide your proxy Pylon from a 3 Stalker rushing player.
- Commit to the attack as quickly as possible and never stop warping-in Zealots and Stalkers until either you have won the game or you have lost all of your units. The strength of this all-in is how quickly and ferociously it attacks, but if you are not constantly attacking then your opponent?s economic/tech advantage can destroy you.

Pros and Cons

This build is a hyper-aggressive all-in that is able to get 5 Stalkers and 1 Zealot warped-in at your opponent?s base at 5:30. Because of how quickly this build attacks, it can punish most greedy PvP builds with ease.
Unfortunately, this all-in is quite easy to scout because you cannot hide the fact that you are getting your first Gateway and Cybernetics Core much earlier than the normal timing.

This build opens with a Forge Fast Expand and then utilizes everything the Twilight Council has to offer in order to all-in your opponent. This two base all-in gets +2 attack, DTs, and mass Blink Stalkers to crush your opponent before the late game.

Scouting

After any early game shenanigans are ruled out, as you have spotted your opponent s third Hatchery going down, then there is no need for any scouting besides what you see with your two pokes.

When you move out with your first 3 units (Zealot, Stalker, and Mothership Core), go to Zerg s third base and see if you can pick off a queen and force some units. If your opponent reveals that he has Roaches already, then instantly pull back and stay behind your wall until your next poke with the DTs.  Expect a Roach defense vs your Blink Stalkers. If your opponent only shows slow Zerglings, then know that your opponent delayed gas and most likely has a larger economy than normal. Expect a lot more units vs your Blink Stalkers. If your opponent shows Speedlings, then pull back and stay behind your wall until your next poke with the DTs. Expect a Roach/Ling or Hydra/Ling defense vs your Blink Stalkers.

When you send your DTs to each base of your opponent, be on the look out for what units he has to defend, or what tech structures he has built. Your push is just about to happen, so it is too late to react in any way, but it is nice to know what units you will be up against before you are actually fighting them head on.

Transitions

This build is an all-in, so there is no true transition out of it. Simply keep reinforcing with your +2 Blink Stalkers (chronoboost your Gateways when you can) until your opponent is forced to leave or your army gets crushed.

If you do not win, but see that your opponent has way too much Roach or Hydra or Roach/Hydra for you to defeat, consider falling back onto a 3rd Nexus, and starting double Robotics Colossi production as a desperation move.

Tips

- Spend all of your early game chronoboost on your Nexii to maximize Probe production.
- Because you are getting your +1 Attack so early, there is no need to chronoboost it very often. Prioritize Probes instead.
- Do not over commit with your first three units. The Zealot can be killed, but if at all possible, retreat with your Stalker and Mothership Core still alive.
- Hide the Twilight Council (and later Dark Shrine) somewhere in your base that is less likely to be scouted by an Overlord.
- Keep a Probe hidden somewhere on the map before you are ready to move out. Being able to place a nice proxy Pylon for the DTs and then later Stalker warp-ins can be the difference between an easy win and a tough loss.
- Obviously, during the fight itself, utilize Blink to save the weakest Stalkers and keep your army alive.

Pros and Cons

This build is a solid all-in that utilizes everything the Twilight Council has to offer. It is a 1-2-3 punch sort of build, first hitting with your initial 3 units, then the DTs, and then the Blink Stalkers, so it keeps Zergs on their toes.

However, because this build is so reliant on the Twilight Council, your opponent flying in an overlord and spotting this will tip them off to everything that you are building; it is very easy to scout (Note: just because it is easy to scout does NOT mean it is easy to defend). Also, it is an all-in, so assuming you do not succeed in crushing your opponent with the Blink Stalkers, there is very little chance you have of coming back into the game. Finally, because this build packs a 1-2-3 punch, it is a more mechanically difficult build than other choices and is not suggested for newer players.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,GoOutProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Nexus,Forge,Pylon,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Chronoboost,PhotonCanon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,GroundWeaponsLevel1,Zealot,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,MothershipCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Stalker,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,TwilightCouncil,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Blink,DarkShrine,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,GroundWeaponsLevel2,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInDarkTemplar,WarpInDarkTemplar,WarpInDarkTemplar,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:22:16 PM;

Reactions to certain builds

Early gateway attacks

Unlike the phoenix opener, this one deals with gateway timings much easier. The oracle can do more than the phoenix in terms of back stabbing. It really puts the other player on a timer with their attack if you can get good damage done with the oracle. And with 2 extra gates coming in instead of a robo and 1 gate you will be able to defend much easier. In combination with the oracle doing damage you'll only really need to stop 1 or 2 waves of units and you'll be good. Overcharge will help delay and buy time as well.

Stargate openers

This requires some alteration on your part. You can't really go for the original build if you scout them going for stargate. You'll have to either cancel and go for faster blink or go into phoenix like the other build. Your oracle won't be able to do much at all if they go stargate. I prefer going phoenix instead of canceling because if they go oracle then you will shut that down 100% and if they don't then you can do a 3gate phoenix all in and just poop all over them because they don't expect you to all in with phoenix. So I'd suggest reading the sOs phoenix opener as well to help with this area of this build.

DTs

If you sniff out a potential DT opener (no gateway units + no chronoboost + all pylons in base or just seeing the twilight council very early) then you just keep the oracle home and wait for them. If after a while they never come then send it across and just play defensive and macro up and use blink to pressure.

Robo Expand

In this scenario you'll be able to use the oracle for full map control and harassment similar to the phoenix opener. The addition to this build is that you'll have blink to do some light pressure at the front as well. The nexus will be a bit later but you should be able to even the worker count with the oracle and blink. Just be sure not to go overboard with stalkers (just 4-6 is fine) otherwise you'll end up behind and you probably won't be able to break him.

Another thing you can do if you see that it's a robo expand early on, is to just do a 3gate oracle all in skipping twilight. This is a blind counter to robo expands but you'll need to see it early enough and choose your reaction immediately.

Blink

This is the builds biggest weakness. If they go for a straight 3/4gate blink all in then you're basically dead. Not every PvP build is perfect with a reaction to everything. If this happens then there's very little you can do since their blink will be much faster and they will have invested more into stalkers earlier than you. The best you can do is hope your oracle stays alive and to kill enough probes after they move out so that you can slowly edge ahead while you wait for your own blink to finish.

Transition to mid game

Again this is very similar to the sOs phoenix opener. Just get your nexus and a robo/forge to macro up into a normal PvP mid game. Use the oracle and blink to provide light pressure wherever you can fit it.

Something you can do if you see them being greedy is to do a 2 base blink all in. The linked VOD below has Trap doing it vs Has.

Scouting

This build is reasonably safe against most your opponent can open with as long as you are smart with your two Reapers.  Use them for scouting by poking at your opponents front in order to determine what your opponent can or cannot be doing as well as potentially killing a Marine or SCV.  Against Reaper play, keep your Reapers more defensively positioned.

This build can transition into Marine/Tank or Mech very easily. However you cannot transition into Bio/Hellbat because you have not invested any time into getting the early game Bio upgrades.

When transitioning into Marine/Tank, start your tank production soon, using the Widow Mines and Reapers to stay safe as well as apply pressure. As your Medivac is moving out, swap your Barracks onto the Factorys Reactor and start double Marine production, add on a Tech lab onto your Factory to start Siege Tank production, and build two more Barracks and a third Refinery as soon as you can afford it to complete your 2 base infrastructure.

When transitioning into Mech, again you must rely on the Widow Mines and Reapers to stay safe and apply pressure, but this time back at home you must be playing greedily. You can dump your money into a 3rd base while your Medivac is moving out. Once youve started 3 bases, getting 2 more Factories, all your Refineries, and a decent Siege Tank count is your obvious next move. YoDa likes to also make a Tech lab on his Starport to get Ravens, but this is a stylistic choice that you dont have to make.

Pros and Cons

This build is great because it gives you a good economy and gives you lots of map control with the early game Reapers/Widow Mines. The harass you can apply is incredibly effective if you split up your Widow Mines effectively throughout your opponents base.

However, it is somewhat vulnerable to Banshee play, so be sure to position your Widow Mines defensively against Banshees. Also, with poor Medivac control, you can very easily lose your Medivac and all the Widow Mines if you fly directly into a Viking or Marine pack. Be sure to prioritize keeping the Medivac alive above all else. Lastly, its not as economical as a 1rax FE build, but it still gets a pretty reasonably fast expand, so its not too far behind a 1rax FE build in terms of economy at all.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,Reaper,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,Factory,Refinery,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,CallMule,LiftRaxFromReactor,SCV,Starport,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleWidowMines,SCV,Marine,SCV,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SCV,DoubleWidowMines,Medivac,SCV,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandRaxOnReactor,TechLabOnFactory,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Viking,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SiegeTank,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,TechLabOnStarport,Refinery,CallMule,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SiegeTank,SupplyDepot,LiftStarportFromTechLab,TechLabOnStarport,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,EngineeringBay,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,LiftStarportFromTechLab,LandRaxOnTechLab,LandRaxOnTechLab,StimPack,CombatShield,Marine,Marine,SiegeTank,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SupplyDepot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:22:16 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Zest 11gate stargate', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'Build lines up VERY tightly. This build comes down to the gas count. You save up a lot of chrono early on to let the build flow and so that way you can chrono each phoenix as they start. By the time each chronod phoenix is finished you will have exactly 100 gas to start the next phoenix. After 4 chronod phoenix you will then have exactly 100 gas to start the robo and then 300 minerals left over for 2 gateways. If you do it perfectly, then you'll know when because it is very exact.

The idea is to get a RIDICULOUSLY fast stargate for phoenix to be able to scout exactly what your opponent is doing, and easily defend said thing that your opponent is doing. The build relies on the early phoenix and MSCore to keep you safe, however of course you'll need to do some adaptations to hold off certain styles. However the main premise behind the build is to set up a nice early game with easy scouting and an easy transition into the mid game with harass potential that normally would not be available.

Now this build is obviously a complete hard counter to normal stargate openers. Your stargate is much faster than theirs so you can easily prepare for an oracle and you will always be ahead in the phoenix count. This pretty much forces them to either do a all in with stargate tech that you can easily poop all over, or go into delayed blink. This is then easily prevented with a robo for immortals as shown in Zest's game vs Trap. If it's an all in, then collect your free win. If not then just proceed into a normal macro game.

If you play vs someone going straight to blink, then a very similar response will be made. Again, the advantage to this build is that you will 100% see what they are doing so you can have enough time to prepare. Upon seeing the fast twilight for blink, (make sure it is blink instead of DTs. This can be determined by the gate count, the stalker count (or lack there of) and other timings from the early build.) you will stop at 2 or 3 phoenix and instantly throw down your robo and extra gates. You'll have to stay on 1 base for some time since it you obviously can't expand vs a 1 base all in. However this response is extremely similar to how you would deal with blink using the old HerO phoenix opener from WoL. In HotS now, the difference is that you have an early MSCore for overcharge and you can transition into the power house immortal/void ray composition that MC has shown to be quite effective.

Vs. DT's it's pretty obvious. You scout it early (because you can) and then make an oracle or very fast robo for detection and continue to expand like normal.

Vs. greedier expands you just take advantage of your early phoenix to harass him while getting your own expansion up and getting even through your phoenix harassment.

The hard part comes with 3gates/4gates and the like. Now I'm not 100% sure of how to deal with this perfectly yet, however the best idea I (and FlatLine) could come up with is relying on the early overcharge (the reason you get the fast MSCore) and phoenix to lift units within range of the overcharge.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Zest standard phoenix into colossus', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'The plan for the build is fairly straight forward and well thought out. Force the Zerg to make hydras and spores to counter the five phoenix you make and then counter this forced investment by teching quickly to colossus. The phoenixes then provide the scouting information that you need to react well to the multitude of strategies that Zerg can throw at you. On top of this advantage they are excellent at harassment (killing drones and queens) and at denying map vision.

Hard counters:Greedy Zerg play is the best thing against this build. The phoenix force Zerg into hydras however they do not guarantee the fact that Zerg doesnt take a 4th base and drone as hard as possible. Still this does not mean that the game is over, with good scouting of Zergs eggs you can take your own 3rd earlier than 10:20 and develop your own economy alongside Zergs. In addition to this weakness early swarm host play off 2 base can be extremely hard to deal with due to the investment into phoenix. A throughout probe scout at the start of the game to deduce if gas has been taken and Zergs third base timing will give you the information you need to go robo first or oracle instead of phoenix.

Reactions:Reaction should be made after seeing units pop out of the eggs.

Lings: Take a slightly earlier 3rd (9:30), skipping immortals and making several zealots to protect the probe and constructing nexus.

Roach: Start immortals before colossus. Either 2 immortals or 1 before the first colossus depending on how early Zerg starts producing roach. Here it is also important to not skip the observer because roach burrow may be a possibility.

Hydra: Skip immortals and continue colossus production.

Vipers: Add Templar archives as soon as possible; cut out void rays as soon as the hive is scouted. For this to work well you may need to warp in zealots for the time being instead of stalkers so you can immediately have gas for 3-5 high Templars when the archives finishes.

VortiX uses a gasless opening and transitions into a strong Roach Zergling timing, aiming to punish greedier Roach play or swift Mutalisk play.

Scouting

n the early stages of the game, all scouting comes from Overlord vision, so be sure that you send your initial 2 Overlords towards your opponent?s natural expansion. You can use your Overlord to compare his Hatchery?s HP to yours, to determine what kind of opener he used. If his hatchery is stronger than yours, he has gone hatchery first. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is the same HP as yours, he has VERY LIKELY done the same build as you. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is weaker to yours, he has gone for a gas and pool before hatchery in some order, meaning his speed is quicker than yours. Banelings before speed in this scenario is often advised, and likely make the Baneling nest in the main to not lose your Baneling tech to mass Zerglings with speed. An alternative is to not use your Gas, and get extra Queens and 2-3 Spine Crawlers. The main theme here is to not get Speed first, as his WILL be quicker. You need to find an edge that isn?t using Zergling Speed.
When playing versus any very early aggression (<10 pool), use your Drones to defend until you have your own Zerglings, a Queen, and potentially a Spine Crawler. Consider canceling the Hatchery for more minerals. Also use your initial overlord to scout when your opponent is taking their natural Hatchery. Feel free to apply some light pressure with your first Zerglings against a Hatch first build, but do not let it mess up your macro.
Make sure you have 2 to 4 Zerglings out on the map at all times. Send your initial 2 Zerglings to your opponent?s base to spot what they have at the front, and if possible get into the main with 1 Ling to see whether your hatching Drones or Zerglings from their eggs. Use the scouting intel that these pokes give you to determine whether you should get Banelings and extra Zerglings to defend yourself or pressure your opponent, or whether you should continue droning.
If your scout Zerglings see Drones hatching, and no wall at the front, you can choose to make Drones OR Zerglings to pressure. If you scout Zerglings, and no wall at the front, you should make the same amount of Zerglings. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings escape, send them back in to scout in 20~ seconds. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings die, remake the scout. Consider another 2 Zerglings for just-in-case Banelings. If you scout a wall, the Zerg is likely playing passive and you are likely safe.
As soon as you are sure you are safe, transition into your choice of tech.

Transitions

However, because you have not yet committed upgrades to either Ranged or Melee, you can choose between transitioning into Roach Hydra or Ling Ultra.
If you do choose to go for Roaches, immediately research Roach Speed and take your third, while droning as heavily as you can without endangering yourself. You can transition to a similar midgame to that of Vortix?s 3 Base Speed Roach, albeit without the fast upgrades.
It is not recommended you go for a Mutalisk transition.

Tips

Aim to focus down Queens with transfuse energy first, and use Roaches to tank any Baneling hits. Emphasize surrounds with your Speedlings and tank Banelings with your Roaches.

Pros and Cons

This build excels and punishing either greedier Roach players, and players rushing for Mutalisks. If it fails, you are behind as with any timing attack. You do not have any tech, you have no upgrades, and you will almost certainly be behind in drones. Additionally, because you are opening gasless, your defense is likely to be much more difficult. You will have no Banelings or Zergling speed, so your defense will revolve entirely around Spine Crawlers, Queens, and building placement.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Queen,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Drone,RoachWarren,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Extractor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,SpawnCreepTumor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,SpawnCreepTumor,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,SpawnCreepTumor', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:21 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '2 Base Speedling Timing', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build appears to be a standard Zerg opener to the untrained eye, but it actually can outright kill most unrefined Terran macro builds in the lower leagues.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. Do your best to stop your opponent from scouting how many Zerglings you are creating. The rest of your scouting will come from your Speedling timing attack. Check whether your opponent is going for a Bio, Mech, or 3CC play. You should at the least be able to force your opponent to lift off their natural unless they made a tight wall ? don?t commit your Speedlings into a meat grinder if your opponent has walled off successfully.

Transitions

As soon as you hit your attack, you need to be droning quite heavily to be able to stand any sort of chance going into the midgame. Only put Drones back in gas and re-begin teching up to Lair, Evolution Chambers, and Mutalisks once you are getting closer to 2 base Drone saturation.

Tips

- Be sure that you take map control with your initial Zerglings. Being able to deny your opponent vision of your building Zerglings will make this attack that much stronger.
- Do NOT attack into a Terran force behind a full wall-off. Force your opponent to abandon their natural and continue droning up.

Pros and Cons

This build looks like a standard ZvT build, but hits your opponent incredibly aggressively with a lot of early game Speedlings. This Speedling timing should either outright win the game or give you an effective economic advantage that will take you into the midgame. However, because you are cutting Drone production in order to support this swell of Zerglings, your economic situation will be much further behind than what you might be used to. If your opponent holds the attack without taking much damage at all, then it?s possible you will simply get rolled over by any sort of counterattack as you are attempting to make Drones.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Extractor,Drone,SpawningPool,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,StartIdle,StopIdleIn5Seconds,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Queen,MetabolicBoost,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:21 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '1 Rax FE into 2 Medivac Push', @SC2VersionID = '2.0.5', @Description = 'General Overview

This 1rax FE build gives you a strong economy, while staying safe from early Protoss pressure. It then transitions into a strong 10 minute push with +1 attack, Stim, Combat Shields, Concussive shells, and 2 Medivacs.

Scouting

When you send your scouting SCVs, you want to look for gasses, nexus energy, and the units he is producing out of his gateway. If he only has 1 gas before his stalker pops, check to see whether your opponent gets his natural at around 5:15 (You can hide your SCV nearby and then run it in around 5:30) to check for an expansion later if need be. If he has 2 gas and you don?t scout an expansion by 6:00, then be wary of an all-in. The common responses to standard Protoss plays are:
- Nexus First: Bunker rush with 4 Barracks instead of getting your 2nd CC OR Stop making marines at 3, get your 3rd CC and go straight into double upgrades to get a leg up in the macro game.
- Double Gas, No Expansion by 6:00: Get 3 bunkers (and a missile turret if you haven?t ruled out DTs). Pull SCVs to repair and provide a meat shield as necessary.
- 1 Gate Expand: Play normal.

Tips

- To confirm that your opponent is not allining you, have an SCV (or scan) go to his natural just before the 6 minute mark. A 4gate will hit before this timing, but 1 bunker and repair should be able to hold a 4gate easily enough; all other scary allins hit much later and this scout will give you enough time to prepare an appropriate defense.
- Unless you are expecting an allin of some sort, do not make marauders until you?ve started your starport. The 50 gas from making 2 marauders at a time will slow down the push by over a minute.
- Also related to this, you can push your medivac timing earlier by getting your factory before your barracks addons. Because you?re not making marauders just yet anyway, the only difference between getting the addons before factory vs getting them after is that you cut a couple of marines and get a faster medivac timing. Both versions are totally valid.
- Once you have your first marauder out, take your own watchtower by scaring away or killing his stalker ? up until you get a marauder out, you have to stay behind your bunker for defense.
- When you attack with your first 2 medivacs, be sure to scan your opponent?s natural in order to determine how much stuff/how many sentries he has waiting for you. If your opponent has too many units, then double drop the main instead of attacking directly into the natural.  Do NOT engage in chokes against sentries.

Transitions

As you?re pushing out, you will need to place down your 3rd CC, 2nd engibay and armory, 2 more rax, and a ghost academy or 2nd starport to counter your opponent?s HTs or collosi. If you?re feeling safe, then place down the 3rd CC and engibay first. If you?re worried about not having enough units, get the 2 more rax earlier, as well as possibly your ghost academy or 2nd starport before 3rd. Transition into 3 base bio with ghosts/vikings when you have the money.

Pros and Cons

This is probably the most standard 1rax FE. Compared to the other variants, it gives you reasonably timed infrastructure, a very safe opening against most 1 base and early 2 base Protoss all-ins, and of course the exact same economy as the other 1rax FEs.  However, early on you have no map control at all because of how well early stalkers can deal with naked marines in the open field; you don?t get up your 3rd CC extremely fast; and you don?t get up your 5 barracks up as quickly as Bomber?s build.
Other TvP builds, besides the 1rax FE variants, should also be considered. This build gives you a lot smaller army and much later upgrades than MKP?s 2rax early on, in exchange for a much stronger economy and a solid timing attack with Medivacs at around the 10 minute mark. Also, it gives you more scans and SCVs to pull to deal with early DTs and/or pressure. While the 2rax will attack early and hit hard with continued aggression, the 1rax FE will give you a much more powerful attack later on, in exchange for leaving you more vulnerable against the early aggression Protoss can lay on.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,CommandCenter,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,Bunker,Marine,SCV,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Refinery,Refinery,SCV,Marine,CallMule,Marine,Marine,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,Marine,SCV,SCV,Marine,SupplyDepot,StimPack,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Marine,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Factory,EngineeringBay,Refinery,Marine,Marine,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,CombatShield,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Marauder', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:21 PM;

This mass Reaper build order gets 2 Reactored Barracks cranking out 4 Reapers at a time in order to overwhelm your opponent with purely mass Reaper.

Scouting

There is minimal SCV scouting with this build because you will open the same regardless of what your opponent is making. The majority of your scouting comes from your constant Reaper attacks.

Against anything but Banshees, constantly produce Reapers to overwhelm your opponent. Against Banshees, be sure to cancel your Reaper production and start producing 4 Marines at a time. If you have done significant economic damage, then getting an Engineering Bay for a Missile Turret is not a bad idea either.

Transitions

This build actually transitions pretty well into a decent midgame for being an all-in. However, you can only transition into Bio after opening with this build because it is hard to utilize your quick Reactors and two Barracks early on if you are trying to transition into Mech. When you feel like you cannot do any more damage with your Reapers, be sure to stop Reaper production and begin your Bio upgrades.

For a standard Bio follow-up, get your natural expansion, start Marine production, and get a 3rd Barracks with a Tech lab. This way you can start Stimpack, an Engineering Bay, Factory, and 3rd Refinery all at the same time just like as if you had opened with a normal 1rax FE into Medivacs.

For a fast upgrade transition, start your natural expansion, Marine production from the 2 Barracks, 2 Engineering Bays, and then +1/+1. As soon as you can, get one more Barracks with a Tech lab so that you can start researching Stimpack. Then, you can take your third Refinery and get a Factory to go into Reactored Medivacs and +2/+2.

For a follow-up timing attack, start your natural expansion, Marine production, and a Factory instantly.  Get a Tech lab on the Factory and start Siege Tank production in order to hit a very fast Marine/Tank push with your second Siege Tank. Behind this contain/attack, you can get your 3rd base, 3rd and 4th Refineries, double Engineering Bays, and 2 or 3 more Barracks (get Stimpack and Combat Shields).

Execution

As soon as your first Reapers pop, start being aggressive. Your number one goal is to deny your opponents Factory for as long as possible (Hellions or Widow Mines can be difficult to maneuver around), but in order to do this, you have to be in your opponents face with your Reapers as soon as they are built. Also, with your constant harass, be sure to dwindle your opponents Marine count without committing too hard and losing any Reapers.

Your Reaper count increases very quickly, and when you get around 6 to 8 Reapers, you can truly overwhelm most units your opponent can have.  Thus, focus on killing his army with your initial Reapersyou will be able to kill his SCVs once his army is dead.

In general, if your opponent sees what you are doing, you are in trouble.  Thus, it is suggested that at least one of your Barracks is build outside your base (even just at your natural will sometimes work fine). However, you can proxy both Barracks outside your main to make this build a little more all-in too. This also works for some mind games because if your opponent scouts you with a Refinery but no Barracks in your main, he will most likely try to defend proxy Marauders (a defense that is awful on most maps against mass Reaper).

Pros and Cons

This build is very aggressive and can catch many opponents off-guard.  With a hilarious amount of Reapers, you are usually able to overwhelm their army within the first 8 minutes. However, even if the all-in does fail, it can still transition into a 11-12 minute Bio+Stimpack/Medivac timing.

However, if you do not do much damage, you will be quite behind your opponent in tech (and possibly income). Also, this build can be easily scouted if an SCV sees both Reactors building before a single unit, so at least one of the Barracks must be proxied outside of your main.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Refinery,OrbitalCommand,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,DoubleReapers,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleReapers,SCV,DoubleReapers,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleReapers,DoubleReapers,CallMule,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:22 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '2 Rax Reaper FE to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with 2 Barracks to produce a lot of Reapers very quickly.  It is a great way to get complete map control with 4 Reapers, apply heavy pressure to an expanding opponent, and transition into standard Bio play.  This 2rax Reaper build also can instantly win against some Gas First or CC First builds.

Scouting

This build is a reasonably safe build against most things Terran can open with as long as you are smart with your initial four Reapers. Thus, SCV scouting early on is not required or even suggested. Use your Reapers to take map control and pick off Marines/scout the front. However, there may come a time when your opponent has a Bunker up and you can no longer poke the front. Then, while prioritizing keeping your Reapers alive over all else, jump into his base and pick off SCVs/continue to scout.

If you scout your opponent opening Banshee, then cease Reaper productioninstead, favor making Marines and getting an earlier Engineering Bay. If you scout a Widow Mine Drop, then be wary of your opponents Medivac, and hole up in your main base until you have enough units to stabilize. If you scout a Marine/Tank/Banshee all-in, then keep your 2nd Command Center in your main base and play defensive. If you scout a 1rax FE, then scout for the Bio or Mech follow-up, and apply pressure whenever possible.

Note: If you scout your opponent going Mech, then add a 2nd Tech lab instead of Reactor on your initial Barracks and build some marauders too.  You can still follow the same basic build order, but you will have a little less gas than normal, so you might need to get early gas geysers than what is written up above.

Transitions

This build commits too much into Infantry upgrades for you to transition into Mech. However, it transitions quite smoothly into Marine/Tank or pure Bio (vs Mech).

For a Marine/Tank transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory for Siege Tank production, take your third base, start your 4th-6th gas geysers, and start another Engineering Bay+Armory for more upgrades. With your midgame push, confirm what unit composition your opponent is going, and play aggressively/passively accordingly.

For a pure Bio transition (if your opponent is playing Mech), start another Engineering Bay and Armory to continue your upgrades as you take your 3rd Command Center and keep your opponent pinned back. Threaten boosted Medivac drops whenever possible, but do not over commit your army if your opponent has an adequate defense.

Pros and Cons

This build is a safe build that also opens aggressively. With this build, you can pick off Marines and SCV, while simultaneously getting a full scout of your opponents base and stressing their multitasking. This build also has a heavy Marine follow up, and can deal with Banshees or 1/1/1 all-ins rather well due to the Reactor/Tech lab first. This transitions into normal Bio play but gives you the advantage due to early harass and map control.

However, this build performs poorly against early Hellion openings. If you scout Reactored Hellions, cease Reaper production instantly and transition into faster Marine/Marauder production. Also, if your opponent holds the Reapers cost-effectively with a 1rax FE or CC First (either due to you mis-microing, or them having a solid defense), then you will be behind going into the midgame economically.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,Barracks,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Reaper,SCV,SCV,Reaper,Reaper,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Barracks,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,CallMule,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,Marine,CombatShield,SCV,Marine,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Refinery,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,Factory,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,EngineeringBay,StimPack,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SCV,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,CallMule,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marine,CallMule,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,LiftFactoryFromReactor,TechLabOnFactory,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:22 PM;

The cool thing is that you don't even need to pressure with the units. You can, but really all you need to do is show that you have some sentries and zealots coming their way, send a hallucinationto scout and then stay at a watch tower and fake them into over reacting while you take a 3rd and tech to this wonderful thing called the Dark Shrine.

Now these aren't meant to be the fastest DTs in the world by any means, but they hit at such an awkward time that the zerg really shouldn't be expecting (especially after seeing a 3gate sentry pressure opening). So they have a chance to do quite a good deal of damage. Also, if they commit to a counter attack with the early units you forced out of them the DTs will do much more damage and you will also have your robo pumping out immortals at home to defend any roach follow ups that could happen.

After your cheeky DTs do their job you can saturate your 3rd and go up to +2/blink/immortal for a strong 3 base timing a few minutes after the DTs hit that can outright end the game if they aren't prepared or took too much damage from the DTs.

The high sentry count early on also makes it so you can throw out non stop hallucinations to really see what the zerg is up to an what tech they're choosing. If you see swarm hosts you of course need to throw down a robo bay and 2nd robo instead of doing the immortal +2 follow up otherwise you own't be ale to bust them. Mutas can also be dealt with via base trade quite well (so long as you identify it quickly enough and can hit while they're in production and you leave some cannons at your 3rd).

If they go for a high hydra count and it doesn't seem like your +2 blink immortal follow up can kill them then you can go into some form of splash damage while taking a 4th and just harassing them a bit to keep him away from your 4th and buy time for said splash damage.

From the point it leaves off its up to you to decide what you want to do. You can go into twilight tech for immortal/archon to do a +2 timing or go into passive colossus play.

Like the name suggests, the opening is extremely safe and versatile. Early aggression is completely thwarted with this build as you get an early Sentry and MSCore to defend proxy oracles or gateway pressure. The 4 extra units that you get out of the gateways before expanding really deny any sort of early 3 or 4gate attacks while the MSCore defends vs phoenix and oracle play. The only thing youll need to be careful with is DT openers since the robo is a little bit late compared to other builds. You should be able to get an idea that DTs will be coming though after seeing little to no unit production with your probe scout and maybe even the twilight council if youre diligent enough. In that case you can get the robo before your nexus if you want to be safe, however with 2 forcefields and stalkers to block the ramp you should be able to stall until your observer is out.

Make sure you remember to use your hallucination scout at 6 minutes to know exactly what youre up against. If you see them playing passively you can skip a 3rd gate and get a much faster forge to be ahead on them in upgrades. You also dont need to warp in anything when WG is done if you see them playing passively, it would just be a waste of resources that dont do anything. You only want to be making units when you need to be or have the money to in PvP. If they out greed you in the opener you need to find ways to out greed them in the follow up. Going for double immortal warp prism harass is another great way to abuse greedy play.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,GoOutProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Sentry,WarpgateUpgrade,Probe,Pylon,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Stalker,Stalker,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Sentry,Probe,Sentry,Nexus,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:22 PM;

This all-in gets the fastest possible Reaper with which to do damage against your opponent. It then follows up with another Barracks so that you can make enough Reapers to overwhelm your opponent and outright win the game before it has even begun.

Scouting

You will be doing this build no matter what, so there is no SCV scouting.  The rest of your scouting will come from your Reapers seeing what your opponent has. However, an interesting SCV timing to note: you will reach a very nice proxy location with your SCV on most 2 person maps if you send it out exactly as you get 50 minerals for the first time at 8 supply.

Transitions

There is no defined transition from this build; it is basically all-in after all.  However, if your opponent goes for very quick roaches then you might want to add-on Tech labs and get Marauders. Besides that, you should have enough Reapers to evenly trade with anything your opponent can make, as long as you can stutter step appropriately.

Tips

- Do NOT lose any of your first 3 Reapers. They are the most important part of this build  applying the early pressure, forcing Drones to be pulled, and most importantly stopping Queens/Roaches from being made. If you lose them, you will most likely lose the game.
- Do not stop for Hatcheries or buildings of any kind. Go straight for the Drones and force some to be pulled off the worker line. If your opponent has their full economy up they will simply outproduce you.
- The only micro you have to do is stutter step against Zerglings/Drones, and pull back the weakest Reaper against Queens.
- 4 Reapers will kill a Queen without you losing a single one of them as long as you pull the targeted Reaper back in time.
- In order to hit the exact build order supplies above, you will have to cut some SCVs for several seconds. I highly recommend watching the tutorial replays (and using the Take Command button with a friend to see how you match up to it) until you get a hang of the build.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,GoOutScv,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,SCV,SCV,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,Reaper,Barracks,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Reaper,SCV,Reaper', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:23 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '15 gas FE into Mine Drop to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reactored Rax FE gives you enough Marines to stay safe against early Protoss pressure, while still getting a fast expansion. Then it transitions into a fast Marine/Widow Mine drop to hit your opponent with some pressure of your own. Interestingly, this build can also transition into standard Bio play or macro Mech play.

Scouting

This build is largely safe against any early pressure that Protoss can apply because it gives you a Reactored Barracks to pump out Marines two at a time. Also, if you are feeling unsafe, you have the minerals after your reactor finishes to place down a Bunker at your natural. Also, if your opponent is doing a 1 base all-in, then instead of being aggressive with your Marines/Widow Mines, you can keep them in your main and defend your Bunker/main. By simply constantly producing Widow Mines, Marines, and Medivacs to keep replenishing your defenses, you can remain safe against most all-ins. However seeing the all-ins coming is crucial. Scouting your opponents natural expansion timing with an SCV is huge (if your opponent does not have an expansion started by around 5:30, expect an all-in). Besides seeing an all-in coming, the rest of your midgame scouting will come from seeing how your opponent defends the Widow Mine drop.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because it gets a good economy, but also enough Marines to defend early game Protoss pokes. Then, the Marine/Widow Mine drop gives you complete map control AND keeps your opponent in the dark as to what followup you are doing (Mech/Bio/3CC). Not to mention that if your opponent is not careful, this build can get Widow Mines in your opponents mineral lines and land some huge hits on Probes, essentially winning the game instantly.

However, this build is more vulnerable to later all-ins such as Void ray or Blink+Mothership core all-ins than more standard bio play (because you will not have stim yet), so be sure to position your Widow Mines defensively and add on more bunkers against a Protoss that you have scouted isnt expanding. Also, with poor Medivac control, you can very easily lose your Medivac and all the Widow Mines if you are not careful. Lastly, this build is not quite as economical as a 1rax FE build, but it still gets a pretty reasonably fast expand, so its not too far behind a 1rax FE build in terms of economy at all.

Tips

- Early game Stalker/Mothership Core pressure may be hard to deal with, but position your Marines effectively and hold on until you get out a Widow Mine in order to defend your base.
- Once you have pinned your opponent on an aggressive build (for instance, by scouting a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), do NOT move out; instead, posture your Widow Mines and Marines in an appropriately defensive position.
- Oracles flat out destroy marines, so if you are fighting an opponent going for Stargate, position your Widow Mines by the mineral line and even consider getting out one turret per base.
- When committing to an attack, boost in and drop one Widow Mine at your opponents main-to-natural ramp in order to trap his army on one half of his base. Once you have his ramp locked down, you will have several seconds of complete control of the half of his base where his army is not located. Use these seconds to kill workers and/or position a mine in a crucial location.
- Above all else, the strength of this build is non-stop harass/pressure.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '3gate Proxy Oracle All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This micro-intensive build rushes for a proxy Stargate, and then pumps out Oracles to do damage to your opponent?s mineral line while simultaneously crushing through your opponent?s front with a strong Gateway+Mothership Core army.

Attack your opponent?s main mineral line with 1st Oracle as soon as it finishes (@6:15ish), and push at front with Zealot/Stalker/Mothership Core.

Scouting

This build is an all-in that makes a lot of units, so is safe in general vs an aggressive opponent ? the only scouting you need to do is spot where your opponent has spawned and whether or not they have taken gas. If you are performing this build vs a gasless Terran, you can be much more aggressive with your initial 3 units and oracle. Versus a gassing Terran, you must be wary of Widow Mines, so be sure not to clump up your units when pushing up ramps or going into your opponent?s mineral line with your Oracles.

Transitions

This build is an all-in, so note that there is no clear transition out of it.  Continue making oracles (up to 3 or 4) and warping in Stalkers so that you can break the front. Note that if your opponent does eventually hold and you end up losing your entire army, then you are most likely behind both economically and in tech. Only expand and continue producing Probes once/if you break the front and you are just making sure that you have enough economy to follow up with a win.

Pros and Cons

This build hits very early with a proxied Oracle, taking advantage of the weakness of early game Marines without upgrades. This build is so strong because it gives you enough units to pressure both your opponent?s front and their mineral line simultaneously. It also then gives you the infrastructure needed to warp-in enough Gateway units to eventually bust down your opponent?s front.

However, this build is a very micro intensive build ? you must be target firing with your Oracle in the main, while not losing any of the units in the front, usually for at least 3 minutes. It is also weak vs Widow Mines if you have poor control. Lastly, note that this build is in fact an all-in, so doing some damage but losing your entire army does put you behind by quite a bit.

Tips

- Chronoboost your initial Stalker so that you deny scouting from your opponent as soon as possible.
- Do not get your initial Probe trapped in your opponent?s base or killed, for that will force you to send another Probe to build the proxy Pylon and lose more mining time.
- You have to target fire individual SCVs for the Pulsar Beam to be most effective.
- One Oracle can take down 4 Marines if it has enough energy for Pulsar Beam the entire time.
- You can use the Oracle?s Envision spell for mobile detection in case your opponent has opened Widow Mine or Banshee.
- Be wary of Widow Mines both in the front or in the main mineral line and stay alert of the 40 second cooldown they have between shots.
- Don?t forget to use the Mothership Core?s Time Warp ability to help vs SCVs/marines in the attack at the front.
- Once/if you break the front, be sure to build an expansion and resume Probe production just in case your opponent does eventually hold.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,GoOutProbe,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Probe,Zealot,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Chronoboost,Pylon,Stargate,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Oracle,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Oracle,Chronoboost,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Oracle,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:23 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '15 Gas Marine-Hellion Expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This fast expansion build created by Innovation uses Hellions to stay safe against Reapers, Banshees, and Hellbatsall while taking map control.

Scouting

Scouting with this build until you get your first Hellions out is not necessary.  However if you want to SCV scout, checking your opponents gas timing clues you in on what they could possibly be doing.

If your SCV sees that your opponent has mined more gas than you have, the most likely are opening with Reapers. However, even if you do not get into your opponents base, you can still tell a Reaper is coming by leaving your scout next to your opponents Barracks to spot whether it dies to a Marine or a Reaper. Your first 2 Marines positioned in your main at a Reaper jump-up spot, followed up by the Reactor for extra Marine production should crush any aggressive Reaper play if you react with and position your initial Marines well. With the Reactored Hellion follow-up you can seize map control and spot if there are any other pushes coming.

When your second Orbital Command finishes and you are still worried about a 1 base play, consider scanning your opponents main base.  Against 1 base play, be sure to have good vision around your base to prevent elevators and to defend your front with a Bunker. Also, a Missile Turret per mineral line with one Viking will shut down any Widow Mine Drops into Cloak Banshee openers. Lastly, if your opponent is going for Hellbat drops, then producing more than 6 Hellions and starting a Viking can be really helpful for your defensenormal Hellions do quite well against Hellbats, and Vikings do quite well at deterring Medivacs.

Execution

If your opponent invested more than 2 Reapers before expanding into bio play, then this is your cue to do heavy damage. If he played greedy and didnt build a bunker at his natural, you can go in with your 4 Hellions, 6 Marines and your first Medivac and kill his un-upgraded Marines. If there is a Bunker at the natural, then simply elevator your Marines and then Hellions into your opponents main and kill as many units as you can.

Against Mech play you might have to play a bit more conservative with your aggression because in Hellion vs Hellion fights, the player who was positioned correctly before the fight usually has the advantage. Instead of committing to an attack or elevator, pulling your army back and placing down a quick 3rd Command Center is a safer way to play.

Against standard Bio play, you can attempt to hit a Marine/Hellion timing at his front with your first 4 Hellions, 6 Marines, and a Medivac. Or, if your opponent is too well defended at the front, perform a 4 Hellion drop and harass his SCVs instead. Getting your 2nd Barracks and starting Stimpack before taking your 3rd Command Center is crucial to staying safe against 10 minute Bio timings and drop play. Alternatively, going Mech and producing Widow Mines/Siege Tanks as you take your third base is a strong way to stay safe as well.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into anything: Marine/Tank or Mech play. Note that as stated in the Execution section above, the follow-up you can do after you get your initial Marine/Hellion/Medivac army is completely dependent on your own preference and the play style of your opponent.

When transitioning into Bio play, against Mech and 3CC builds you can get away with starting your 3rd CC right away and following-up with 2 Barracks with Tech labs (to start Stimpack/Combat Shields), 3 Refineries, and 2 Engineering bays. Against more traditional Bio play it is necessary to start a Tech lab on your initial Barracks for a quicker Stimpack. Then, after taking a 2nd Refinery, you can build a 2nd Barracks onto the naked Reactor and start Siege Tank production to take yourself into the midgame. This is followed up by a 3rd Command Center (between 8:00-8:30), 1 more Barracks, both Refineries at your natural expansion, and 2 Engineering bays. Not having Stimpack completed in time for the inevitable 10ish minute drop play can be a game changer because with the new Medivacs boosting around your main and natural, it is very easy to get caught out of position and take a lot of damage for free.

ForGG does an interesting follow-up where he simply constantly produces Hellions  sometimes going up to 20+ Hellions  and overwhelms his opponents before they have Stimpack or enough Siege Tanks to deal with this attack. Mass Hellions are surprisingly good against opponents who make Hellbats or try drop play without a perfect follow-up.

Another possible follow-up is going for Mech play. This is easily achieved by keeping the Factory onto the Reactor for more Hellions, getting all 4 Refineries while starting more Factories, and starting your 3rd Command Center very quickly. Building some Vikings for drop defense will definitely come in handy as well.

Pros and Cons

This build defends early pressure quite easily, while getting a quick expansion and going into the midgame. Also, once your first Medivac is out, you hit your opponent with lots of pressure early on to kick start an aggressive game. Finally, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for opening with a 1/1/1 grants you the freedom to go into nearly anything.

However, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades. Also, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Factory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,Starport,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SCV,OrbitalCommand,SCV,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,Medivac', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:23 PM;

This build can be performed against any opener Terran has. The only scouting you need to do is send your initial 2 Overlords to your opponent?s base in order to spot both where your opponent is spawned and whether or not they have a Bunker or Marauders that you will have to break down or fight.

Transitions

This 7 Roach Rush build is a strong 1 base attack that opens with a lot of units and few Drones, so your follow-up will be very slow. That being said, you should start to float some minerals as you are reaching your opponent?s base, so start a natural Hatchery, build a lot more Drones, and get Metabolic Boost as soon as possible. Going for a Lair and getting a Banelings Nest in order to start a Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk composition is a strong way to deal with Terran in the midgame.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong 1 base attack that can crush your opponent early before they have their midgame even established. However, this build can be held off if your opponent scouts it and prepares with a repaired Bunker or Marauders if they have opened with a 1 base play of their own. It also is much less economical than any Hatchery First openers.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Queen,Zergling,RoachWarren,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:23 PM;

If they go DT's, you can either continue chronoing oracles and try to kill them, or play defensive and stay back and get a robo and expand.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Alicia 12-12 Colossus All-In', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build utilizes an unconventional Gateway and gas timing to produce a fast Mothership Core for scouting before smoothly transitioning into a 2 Colossus All-in.

Attack your opponent when your 2nd Colossus finishes (@9:30ish) with 2 Colossi, 3 Stalkers, 3 Sentries, and a Mothership Core with about 45 Probes at home.

Scouting

Do not Probe scout with this build. Because you are using a 12/12 opening, you will have an extremely early Mothership Core for immediate scouting. Your Mothership Core should be directly rallied to the enemy base upon completion.

The early Mothership Core allows you to see exactly what a Terran is aiming for. If they are aiming for Factory aggression with a Starport simply chronoboost out 2 Observers, placing one in each base. Position your 3 Stalkers in the main to catch a drop. Bring your Mothership Core home and use it to defend the natural with Photon Overcharge. This defensive setup should allow you to defend any multi-pronged aggression from the Terran.

If it is merely a 2 base, 3 Barracks opener, then proceed as normal.

Transitions

As this is an all-in, the transitions for this build are heavily dependent on the damage you deal. If you kill a significant amount of workers but find yourself unable to finish your opponent off, transition into normal Blink/Colossus play. If you do not kill many workers and lose your army, then you most likely will lose to a follow-up counterattack. If you trade armies but do eventually lose your own, you are free to instantly transition into anything you want?Blink/Colossus, Chargelot/Archon, or Storm play are all equally viable. Remember to start 2 Forges and chronoboost your upgrades to catch up in the upgrade war.

Tips

Produce a third Colossus and leave it at home along with your Mothership Core. This allows you to effectively defend counter aggression with 2 Photon Overcharges. You have enough punch in your frontal push with Forcefield and Guardian Shield not to require Time Warp.

Only chronoboost your 10th and 13th Probe before the completion of your Cybernetics Core. You need to bank energy to allow you to simultaneously chronoboost your Mothership Core and first Stalker. Otherwise your scouting information is delayed and a Reaper can play havoc with your main.

Once you have completed your Mothership Core and initial Stalker, return to chronoboosting Probes until the completion of your Robotics Bay. At this point exclusively chronoboost Colossi. If you find you have spare Nexus energy chronoboost Thermal Lance but prioritize accelerating your Colossus count ? your push begins once both Colossi have been completed.

Pros and Cons

This all-in is one of the most difficult to scout builds currently available to Protoss. To most Terran players it will look like standard macro play and may even prompt incorrect reactions such as earlier Medivac aggression or a fast 3rd Command Center. Also, because of the fast Mothership Core scout, you will almost always be able to identify Terran?s early game build structure (3rax, 1/1/1, etc).

However, because your Mothership Core stays at home for defense and you have no upgrades to fall back on, your attack is fully all-in?there is no way to retreat your Colossus safely if your attack fails and you are certain to fall behind in upgrades as the game stretches on.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Stalker,Chronoboost,WarpgateUpgrade,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Assimilator,Stalker,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,Nexus,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Chronoboost,Stalker,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Observer,RoboticsBay,Assimilator,Assimilator,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,WarpInSentry,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Pylon,Probe,Probe,ExtendedThermalLance,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:23 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Blink into Robo', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'So this build still goes into colossus however it opens with a more aggressive stance that puts you in more control during the early parts of the game. Going straight for colossus double forge is extremely passive and leaves no real room for you to do much until you get your 3rd base saturated. However opening blink allows you that small amount of map control/versatility that we loved oh so much a few patches ago that was unfortunately ripped from our repertoire.

The other cool thing about this build is that unless they open gas first, you can do this build basically any game. Even 1 rax reaper into factory gets shut down by this since the 2nd observer comes out in time to deal with any widow mine drops that will come from that build. You can even do some follow up blink pressure with a lot of added stalkers to punish them while they're building their infrastructure up and their unit count is low.

Even the 3 rax stim builds that I made a thread on earlier this week can be stopped with this build. I found out really that once you see that build coming into form, then it's all about not being greedy with your tech and trying to get a colossus out ASAP or something like that. You just need to make as many units as possible out of your gateways. It won't hold it as well as the purely defensive robo/3gate style however you definitely can still make the hold so long as you get your gates at the time in this write up and not later like in some variants.

This build puts us back in control again which is what we have wanted for so long after blink/HT openers have been pushed out of style. Of course the only down side to this build is that the upgrades are later, however you can easily compensate for that with double forge and mass amounts of chronoboost being used into it. Since the build is so solid you shouldn't be losing too many probes to early harassment (early blink helps with that so much) so the only thing that you'll need to use your chronoboost on is the upgrades.

Adding a warp prism or two while you're getting your 3rd set up also meshes with this build very well. Many protosses (PartinG especially) almost always go for a warp prism to do a 4 zealot drop after they do some light harassment with the stalkers. It's just an added way to keep the terran back as you get your colossus set up and really keep the terran on their side of the map for as long as possible.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Bomber 3CC Combat Shield', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

Simple, economical, and deceptively dangerous, Bomber takes us back to 2012 with an incredibly early 16 Marine Combat Shield Push that simultaneously takes a 6:00 3rd. An excellent low APM alternative for players who dislike Reapers and Hellions.

Scouting

Because you are not opening Reapers, you are in danger of unexpected Roach or Speedling attacks. And because you are not making Hellions, you will have difficulty confirming the existence of a Zerg third base if Speedlings are on the map, as well as being vulnerable to unscouted Baneling Busts. As such, your only SCV scout is crucial in determining if your Zerg opponent has opened with gas or not.

If your opponent has opened gasless, keep your scouting SCV alive and hidden as long as possible to confirm the existence of a third base by 6:30. If no third is taken by 6:30, it is worth scanning, as many dangerous builds, such as Soulkeys 1-1 Roach Timing, start gasless off of two bases.

If your opponent has opened gas but stopped mining at 100 gas, assume that Speedlings are on the way. As such, depending on how quickly your opponent chose to take his gas, a wall off is necessary before six minutes. It is fine to use your 3rd CC as part of your natural wall off on certain maps, such as Frost, Yeonsu, and Polar Night. However, if your opponent went for much faster Speedlings (Gas -> Pool -> Hatch), then it is advisable to wall off ASAP using Depots and bunkers, and delaying your 3rd CC. Additionally, consider not performing your Marine timing if the speedling count is abnormally high (30 or above).

If your opponent has opened gas but has continued mining past 100, it is necessary to check whether or not Metabolic Boost is researching with your scouting SCV. Beyond that, scan to see what is coming your way and build extra bunkers if necessary. You are specifically looking for a combination of the following: obvious tech cues (baneling nest, roach warren, fast lair), lack of Queens/Creep Spread (if there are only two injecting, then something is wrong), lack of Evolution Chambers, lack of a timely third base, and a flood of overlords.

It is highly reommended you do not perform your timing unless it is obvious your opponent is opening nonthreatening gas tech, such as Overlord Speed or very fast upgrades. And finally, depending on what you scout, if it becomes very obvious that no timing will occur, consider getting Stimpack instead of Combat Shields, as well as producing Marauders from your tech labbed Barracks.

Transitions

Because you have already invested so much infrastructure into Barracks and infantry upgrades, your only transition from this build is a bio based composition. However, because you have invested no money whatsoever into Factory tech, you can transition smoothly into Biomine, Biobat, Biobat with Thors, Marine Tank, or even Pure Bio.

Additionally, the Factory and Engineering Bay ordering is entirely up to the users discretion. If you feel you are in danger of a counter all in, or want faster Medivacs for aggression, then start the Factory first. If you feel that you do not want to fall behind in upgrades, start two Engineering bays first.

Tips

Your first priority with this build is accurately assessing whether or not you can do damage with a timing push.

If you feel you can do damage with the timing, do your best to ensure your opponent has as little idea of it as possible. Have lone marines ready at your base to deny Overlord scouting, and hide the bulk of your marines on the main ramp connecting to the natural base. Keep your Barracks away from the edges of your base; especially the one with a researching Tech Lab. If there is a way to construct a third base that an Overlord can obviously see it (such as by the natural choke at Polar Night, where there is almost always an overlord), then that would be best. Most Zergs upon seeing such an early third will let their guard down and drone heavily.

As youre moving out with the Marine squad at 7:00, have at least two scans saved and do your best to avoid obvious overlord positions, and either clear the towers beforehand (impossible vs Speedlings) or avoid them altogether if possible. The best possible scenario is you catch your opponent completely off guard with no Larva banked in the middle of a huge cycle of drones, with 16 marines at his third base.

Use your banked scans as best you can to clear huge swatches of creep, with priority on active tumors. If you do kill the third, use your discretion to decide whether or not attacking further into the natural (emphasis now on the Evolution Chambers or Nat Hatch) or retreating with your marines is the better choice.

DO NOT REINFORCE THIS PUSH. It relies heavily on the element of surprise. Once Zerg reacts and begins to produce cycles of defending units, your reinforcements (3 marines every 25 seconds) will be easily overwhelmed without force multipliers such as Widow Mines, Medivacs, or Battlecruisers.

During the actual engagements, stutter stepping and positioning are critical. Wedging all your marines into the mineral line of his third and using his hatchery as a choke seems to be the optimal engagement zone. If slow banes are involved, split as best you can without stim or target fire them down.

On the other hand, if you feel you cannot do damage with your timing, theres no problem whatsoever. Stay behind your walloff, make bunkers if necessary, and wait for Factory Tech and Medivacs to perform a standard creep clearing push. You are already ahead with your 6:00 3rd and triple MULE income.

Pros and Cons

This build is one of the most economical builds available while still having a surprising amount of potential to outright win a game. It also deflects non baneling based aggression excellently, such as Roach Ling timings. Additionally, the build has a surprising amount of creep clearing potential, as few Zergs will stand toe to toe with 16 Combat Shield Marines this early in the game; most Zergs will surrender their creep without a fight.

The weaknesses of this build, however, are equally apparent.If scouted, the push has a high chance of outright failing. In addition, because your infrastructure is so limited during and following the attack (3 mostly naked Barracks), you are extremely susceptible to counter all ins and heavy Baneling based counter attacks, especially after you kill their third but lose all 16 marines in the process.

And finally, because you have not opened Reapers or hellions, your information is extremely limited, and confirming the existence of a third base can be very difficult if you lose your scouting SCV too early on.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,OrbitalCommand,Marine,CommandCenter,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,Marine,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,OrbitalCommand,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Marine,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,CombatShield,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,CommandCenter,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Marine,Refinery,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,Marine,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,CallMule,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,EngineeringBay,EngineeringBay,ReactorOnBarracks,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,StimPack,OrbitalCommand,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,InfantryArmorLevel1,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Factory,Refinery,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marauder,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SCV,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Marauder,Armory,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,CallMule,TechLabOnFactory,Factory,SCV,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DrillingClaws,Barracks,Barracks,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,ConcussiveShells,InfantryWeaponsLevel2,InfantryArmorLevel2,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,ReactorOnFactory,CommandCenter,Marauder,DoubleMedivacs', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:24 PM;

This variant on the standard 1rax FE build gets the midgame infrastructure up much earlier for a lot of midgame aggression, while sacrificing early safety against one and early two base Protoss attacks.

Scouting

When you send your scouting SCV, look for the number of gasses your opponent has, their Nexus energy, and also the units they are producing out of the Gateway. If he only has 1 gas before his stalker pops, check to see whether your opponent gets his natural at around 5:15 (You can hide your SCV nearby and then run it in around 5:30 to check for an expansion later if need be). If he has 2 gas or is not spending his chronoboost, then be wary of any sort of early attack.

Tips

- To confirm that your opponent is not all-inning you, have an SCV (or scan) go to his natural just before the 6 minute mark.  A 4gate will hit before this timing, but 2 bunkers and repair should be able to hold a 4gate easily enough; all other all-ins hit much later and this scout will give you enough time to mount an appropriate defense.
- You cannot afford Marauders with this build until you start the Starport. The 100 extra minerals and 50 gas from making 2 Marauders at a time will slow down the push by over a minute.
- Take map control when you initially poke out with your first two Medivacs. Do NOT engage Protoss yet though. This build sets up your infrastructure for a lot of reinforcements, but does not increase your army size until those reinforcements have actually arrived.
- Once the first or second wave of units from all 5 Barracks have popped (you should be making 3 Marauders and 4 marines at a time), straight up fight Protoss? army. Spread your army, kite Zealots, pick up units trapped between forcefields and zealots with Medivacs, and dodge storms as best you can. However, do not forget to build reinforcing units, and do not stop the aggression unless you are forced to. During this aggression, you also get to see what army composition your opponent has.  Get a 4th Refinery.  Then react appropriately to Colossus by making Vikings (and possibly a 2nd Starport) and to High Templar by making Ghosts.

Transitions

During the fighting, place down your 3rd CC, 2nd Engineering Bay and Armory, and Ghost academy or 2nd Starport to counter your opponent?s HTs or Colossi. Fighting your opponent across the map forces them to reveal which tech path they?ve gone down and safely give you the time you need to counter it before it comes to your base.

Pros and Cons

This 1rax FE variant cuts many early-game corners compared to other 1rax FEs.  Delaying the 2nd Refinery means that you cannot afford any Marauders at all until after your Starport has been started. Thus, in case your opponent does an early-game attack, you have to rely on Bunkers and SCVs to repair and tank damage much more than you would in other builds. However, what this build lacks in the early game it more than makes up for in the mid game. Getting five Barracks up that fast means that you can apply a lot of midgame aggression against your opponent.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Creator Blink-obs expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'This build allows for a huge amount of versatility by being able to deal with pretty much any opener they can throw at you.

The idea is that you get a lot of units out of 1 gate while teching up to blink and robo so that way you can easily split your forces to deal with the variety of openings that can come at you. Once you determine your position in the game, you can easily expand and start teching up to immortal/archon.

So how exactly do you deal with the different openings?

Stargate:

This is a fairly simple one. Most of the time you won't be able to see that they're going stargate (unless it's a very quick directly after cyber build) in which case you will be playing defensively with your units anyway. Whether it's phoenix or oracle you will have 3 stalkers and a MSCore to deal with whatever comes at you with an additional 3 stalkers coming out of WG once that finishes, with blink soon following. This allows for a very easy stargate defense in which case you can then expand and put on light pressure with your blink/obs while defending at home with the MSCore.

If you want you can cancel the robo to go for a blink all in after seeing this, however some people (like Zest in the Shoutcraft tournament) will go for stargate and then DT to follow it up if they see you do blink/robo expecting you to cancel it. However this is usually because of pros at the highest level trying to get every ounce of their money for something beneficial, so it was mostly a smart gamble by Zest.

Blink:

With blink you're going to have to identify it a little early. If you see a large stalker opening then blink should be in the back of your mind. In this case you can easily get an immortal out with time bought by overcharge so you can have blink + immo to his pure blink. If he commits heavily then you can usually just counter push for the win, or you can simply expand and be ahead since you have the tech advantage.

DT:

This is quite simple as well. Robo finishes, you get an obs out, you kill DTs, you expand and continue as normal.

Robo expand:

In this situation your nexus will be slightly farther behind than his, however you will have the ability to poke and prod at him with blink so the slightly later nexus is not the biggest of deals. You will have added mobility and you will also know that they are being super passive so you can chrono probes nonstop to get back on the same economic footing. The best thing you can do with your stalkers is to pick off sentries that you see in the front. This denies him scouting (no hallucination) and requires him to waste gas he doesn't want to replenish them if he really wants to.

If you want you can totally take a slightly later 3rd (~8-9 minutes) and just get 3 extra gates before the expand if you don't feel comfortable taking the fast 3rd. Just make sure you keep the robo timing the same.

This build really relies on you being able to scout with the oracle and reacting to what the zerg is doing. It's a very reactive and versatile opening which why I said it doesn't really die to anything as long as you execute it properly. Even if the stargate gets scouted/the oracle can't get too much done don't worry. You at least want to get scouting information with it as that is the most important. The drone or queen kills are only an added bonus if they aren't prepared.

If you see any sort of ling pressure to contest your 3rd then you should bring the oracle back to help defend. It's best to move the oracle down the common path of attack when it spawns to see if this kind of pressure is coming.

Any roach aggression can be stopped by earlier void ray production and even a few immortals before colossi if it's really early roach aggression.

Defending hydra/ling attacks is all about good sim city and forcefields and being sure your colossus doesn't get supply blocked or delayed at all. Your colossus being late is probably the worst thing you can do with this build as that's what really keeps you alive vs a lot of zerg pressure.

And of course if you see spire play then you have 3 stargates to make mass phoenix.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Bomber Reaper FE to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE, optimized by Startale Bomber, gets out exactly one Reaper for scouting as well and a ridiculously fast Command Center. Then it follows up with a Bio army with just as much strength as a gasless 1rax FE can provide.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they get an expansion (or note if they do not expand by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Also, if you do not know whether your opponent has a Stargate or not, it is a safe plan to build one Missile Turret per mineral line to defend any Oracle shenanigans.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and Medivacs. After this build, get a 3rd Command Center, 3 more Barracks (for a total of 8), and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to head into a strong, late game army.

Note: It is completely viable to replace the 4th and 5th Barracks in this build with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost, most Terrans (including Startale Bomber) have been getting lots of Barracks early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having those extra reinforcements.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important  be sure to mine exactly 100 Gas so that you have enough for the Reaper and Reactor and no more.  Getting your natural Command Center up before the 2nd Supply Depot is a strength of this build.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add a 2nd Bunker at the front, and consider getting a Missile Turret in each mineral line.
- Oracles, even with an expansion, massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you have to instantly get out one Missile Turret per mineral line.
- The gas timings of this build are somewhat more delayed than what you might be used to if you usually play with a gasless 1rax FE.  Therefore, be sure to cut all Marauder production until after your Starport has completed.
- When you move out with your Medivacs, be sure to boost in and out of where your opponent is expecting.  Forcing out the Mothership Cores energy can be the difference between an quick win and a potential loss.

Pros and Cons

This build is good because it gives you the economy and infrastructure on par with a Wings of Liberty style 1rax FE. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Getting such a fast Reactor gives you enough marines to defend early game Stalker + Mothership Core harass.  Finally, this build takes no detours and goes directly into Bio+Medivac play, so your Stim+Medivac aggression happens much sooner than if you go for an early Widow Mine Drop.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes, especially if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that with such a low Marine count in the early game, fast Oracles can do a lot of damage if your scouting/turret timing is not perfect.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Barracks,Bunker,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,StimPack,Marine,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,Factory,EngineeringBay,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,Marine,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Marine,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Starport,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnFactory,ScannerSweep,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,CombatShield,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,SCV,DoubleMedivacs,Marauder,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Barracks,Barracks,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,InfantryArmorLevel1,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,DoubleMedivacs,SCV,SCV,Barracks,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:24 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '15 Gas Raven Expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This fast expansion build created by Maru uses a lot of scouting in order to stay safe against Reapers and Banshees, getting out enough Marines and the infrastructure needed to defend all sorts of aggression that early-game TvT can have.

Scouting

Figuring out your opponents opening so that you can react appropriately when you are performing this build is crucial. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that you SCV scout around 12 or 13 supply in order to see whether your opponent has opened gas first or not.

If your SCV gets into your opponents base and sees that your opponents Barracks is delayed compared to yours, you know that they are opening gas first  the most likely scenario being Polts Gas First Banshee Build.  However, there are some Gas First Hellion openers, so stick around until the first Marine pops so that you can see what add-ons your opponent is making. A fast Tech lab usually will be swapped off onto the Starport for a fast Banshee. A fast Reactor can be used to swap off and go for Hellions.  Against Hellion play, build your Command Center and keep your Marines on the high ground.

If you get into your opponents base and see that your opponent has mined more gas than you have, the most likely scenario is that they are opening with Reapers. Note that even if you do not get into your opponents base, you can still tell a Reaper is coming by leaving your scouting SCV next to your opponents Barracks to spot whether the first unit to pop out is a Marine or a Reaper. Against Reaper play, build your Command Center and position your Marines on the high ground. If your opponent commits to 2rax Reaper or Mass Reaper play, transitioning into Innovations Marine/Hellion Expand to stay safe (instead of taking a 2nd gas and instantly opening with a Starport) is a common reaction. With the Reactored Hellion follow-up you can seize map control and deal with Reapers quite easily.

If your opponent is opening with an expansion of their own or has mined the same amount of gas as you have, then consider cutting the Raven and going into delayed Cloaked Banshee OR Siege Tank production of your own. Whichever you choose is personal preference.

When your second Orbital Command finishes and you are still worried about a 1 base play, consider scanning your opponents main base.  Against 1 base non-Banshee play, starting Siege Tanks and using your Raven for Seeker Missile is an easy way to stay safe. Against 1 base Banshee play, position your Marines and Raven near your production or mineral line as you start a Viking or two for extra defense.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either Marine/Tank/Medivac or Mech play.

When transitioning into Marine/Tank play, against Mech and 3CC builds you can get away with starting your 3rd Command Center right away and following-up with 2 Barracks with Tech labs (to start Stimpack/Combat Shields), 3 Refineries, and 2 Engineering bays.

Against a player opening straight into Bio play, however, it is necessary to start a Tech lab on your initial Barracks as soon as possible for a quicker Stimpack. Then, after taking a 2nd Refinery, you can build a 2nd Barracks onto the naked Reactor and start Siege Tank production to take yourself into the midgame. This is followed up by a 3rd Command Center (between 8:00-8:30), 1 more Barracks, both Refineries at your natural expansion, and 2 Engineering Bays. Not having Stimpack completed in time for the inevitable 10ish minute drop play can be a game changer because with the new Medivacs boosting around your main and natural, it is very easy to get caught out of position and take a lot of damage for free.

Another possible follow-up is going for Mech play. By starting a 3rd Command Center instantly, getting all 4 Refineries, and making 2 more Factories and an Armory, youll instantly be at the midgame infrastructure you need. Be sure to make Vikings for drop defense and start your Siege Tank production instantly so that you have a healthy Siege Tank count to defend any early drops/pressure.

Tips

- Fully read the Scouting section of this build before performing it in a game.  The reactions to scouting information as presented in the Scouting section must be learned before this build is even worth performing in a real game.
- SCV scout with this build at 12 or 13 supply.
- If you are absolutely sure your opponent is not opening with Banshee play, then starting delayed Banshee production of your own instead of the Raven is a great way to get midgame map control and a lot more scouting information.
- Against the first Banshee, you might need to pull all of your Marines to your production or mineral line while you wait for the Raven to pop.  This is completely fine  try to minimize damage by pulling all of your SCVs to one location so that your Raven provides detection over all of your vulnerable spots once it is out.
- Anticipate how many Banshees your opponent is making and either continue to produce Vikings or stop after 1 or 2 for safety.
- Be sure to transition into your midgame infrastructure as soon as you have successfully defended the Banshees.

Pros and Cons

This build defends early pressure quite easily, while getting a quick expansion and going into the midgame. Also, this build is incredibly versatile when it comes to transitions, for opening with a 1/1/1 grants you the freedom to transition into nearly anything.

However, this build requires a lot of scouting in order to be performed effectively.

This build opens with a Stargate for Phoenix and some early ground units to provide the infrastructure necessary to react to every build an opposing Protoss might throw at you.

Benchmark: When your Nexus finishes (@6:45ish), you should have 3 Phoenix, 1 Sentry, 1 Stalker, a Mothership Core, and around 23 Probes.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker back to the protection of your Sentry quickly if you have to defend an early attack.

The majority of your scouting comes from your Phoenix. Your Phoenix should be able to get into your opponent?s main base and determine what tech route you see your opponent going.

- If your opponent is expanding quickly, then feel safe while applying some light harass with your Phoenix. You can dictate the pace of the game by committing to a lot of Phoenix or starting a Twilight Council or Robotics Facility and defaulting back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then be sure that deal some economic damage with your initial Phoenix. Either commit to Phoenix and Void Rays or default back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.
- If your opponent has a Stargate, then be sure to not take damage against early Phoenix or Oracles by initially positioning your units defensively.  Getting a healthy Phoenix lead against your opponent will most likely be enough for you to end the game.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then consider getting a Robotics Facility instantly in order to make one Observer for detection against DTs.  Alternatively, you can position your units with an Oracle at your main ramp and defend for a while. Regardless, do not make more Phoenix and instead transition into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame with your economic advantage.

Transitions

This build is a very safe opener that gives you the scouting capabilities and infrastructure to react to any build your opponent can perform. However, the actual steps you take to transition into a stable midgame often depend completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with. This is why scouting with your Phoenix and generally being active on the map (perhaps with a delayed scouting Probe) is crucial.

In Stargate vs Twilight macro games, harass your opponent with your Phoenix, but transition out of Stargate units into an economic Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame as soon as possible. In Stargate vs Robotics macro games, again harass your opponent to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you get a healthy Chargelot/Archon count up. Keep tabs on your opponent?s tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Stargate vs Stargate macro games, position your Phoenix more defensively while you chronoboost your Phoenix non-stop.

The most common way to start the transition into Chargelot/Immortal/Archon is by starting a Robotics Facility and 2 more Assimilators, followed by a Twilight Council and Forge for +1 Ground Weapons and Zealot Charge. Add on the Templar Archives and Archons when you can afford it.

Tips

- Once you start your Mothership Core, save your chronoboost so that you can dump it all into Phoenix. There is no need to chronoboost Warpgate (unless you spot your opponent going for very early aggression).
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial few Gateway units to stop a Probe from setting up a proxy Pylon and allowing for a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap?s 3gate All-in).
- Against Stargate play, position your Stargate units defensively around your mineral lines to defend potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- Otherwise, always be active with your Phoenixes. The main priority for the Phoenix is to get scouting information, for only when you have a full read on your opponent?s build can you can start chronoboosting probes and enter the midgame.
- Even though you open with a Stargate, transitioning into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon unit composition in the midgame can be very strong.
- When entering the late game, however, be sure to produce Tempest from your inactive Stargate?especially against a Colossus-based opponent.

Pros and Cons

This build is a versatile, economic build that can harass your opponent and provide the scouting information necessary to defend a fast expansion.  Also, your Phoenix can do terrible, terrible damage to Robo-based build such as duckdeok?s 3Gate Robo, and even perform well in a macro game against greedy builds such as NaNiwa?s Safe Expand.

However, this build requires a lot of scouting information to be executed effectively. It also is quite difficult to defend early attacks if you do not kill your opponent?s proxy Pylon.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Dear Phoenix into Colossus', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Forge Fast Expand and then gets several Phoenix for map control and scouting. While you are using the scouting Phoenix, you transition into Colossus play in order to secure your third base and set up a stable midgame OR all-in your opponent with a Stalker/Colossus/Phoenix army.

Scouting

After any early game shenanigans are ruled out, as you have spotted your opponent s third Hatchery going down, the rest of your scouting will come from your Phoenix.

Use your Phoenix to first pick off every Overlord on the map that is undefended by creep/Queens. Then use them to poke around your opponent s base   picking up units not protected by Spore Crawlers/Queens. Be sure to focus on what tech structures you see your opponent making. If you spot a swell of Roaches, stay on 2 bases and consider extra Immortals. If you spot a Hydralisk Den, be sure your Robotics Bay is constantly producing Colossus. If you spot a Spire, instantly get a Twilight Council and go for Blink/+2 Ground Weapons while you resume Phoenix production from your Stargate. You might have to cancel your Colossus production.

Transitions

This build can either all-in off of 2 bases or safely secure a third base to comfortably play a macro game.

If you are choosing to all-in with this build, be sure to go up to 8 Gateways and 3 Colossus with Extended Thermal Lance before moving out. Constantly reinforce with Stalkers as you use your +1/+1, 3-Colossus, 5-Phoenix, 8 Gateway all-in to crush through a Roach/Hydra based army. Watch out for Viper play, though!

If you are choosing to play the macro game, timing your third base is tricky. Dear warps in a lot of Zealots from his 4 Gateways before securing his third if he sees any amount of units on the map with his constant Phoenix scouting. If Dear doesn t see any Roach/Ling force out on the map (as in game 3 of Dear vs Soulkey), then he will take it even before his first Colossus is started. As you take your third base, set up a Cannon defense surrounded by Pylons/Gateways to help with Zergling runbys as you tech up into the late game. Getting a Twilight Council to continue +2 Ground Weapons and Blink is a solid way to both deal with tech switches and set you up for a 3 base attack. Be sure to spend your excess minerals on proxy Pylons and Zealot runbys to keep your opponent s base count in check.

Tips

- Spend all of your early game chronoboost on your two Nexus to maximize Probe production.
- The exact FFE build order you use is up to your personal preference. Dear has performed this build after a Forge First FFE, Nexus First FFE, and a failed attempted Cannon Rush.
- If possible, hide the Stargate somewhere in your base that is less likely to be scouted by an Overlord.
- Chronoboost your Stargate to get out those Phoenix as quickly as possible to deny any Overlord scouting of your follow-up Robotics transition.
A main strength of this build is its versatility, but you can only be versatile if you have the necessary scouting information. Scouting your opponent s tech path and army production with your Phoenix is crucial.
- If you spot your opponent playing very greedy, you can choose to warp-in all of your Zealots from your 4 Gateways aggressively and hit a +1 Zealot/Phoenix timing while continuing the build at home.
- Chronoboost your Robotics Facility to get out your Colossus as quickly as possible and set up a solid midgame army.

Pros and Cons

This build is an incredibly versatile build that can be used as a macro opener or a 2 base all-in. It gets out early Phoenix for scouting and map control while transitioning into a solid ground based Colossus midgame.

This 1gate FE follows up with a 6gate, 2 base Blink Stalker attack, using the Mothership Core for high ground vision and Time Warp.

Benchmark: When Blink finishes (@7:40ish), you should have with 6 Stalkers and 36 Probes at home.

Attack your opponent?s natural/main with your first full warp-in from all 6 Gateways (@8:30ish) with 12 Blink Stalkers and constant Stalker reinforcements.

Scouting

This build is an aggressive opener that makes a lot of units, so you will not have to worry about Probe scouting. Against Reaper play, keep your first Stalker on a common hop-up ledge in order to deny your opponent scouting the Twilight Council. Against other defensive play, poke out to your opponent?s front with your first Stalker and check to see whether your opponent is going for Widow Mines or a quick CC into Bio so you know how to micro when you Blink into his main base with all of your units.

Transitions

This build is a strong 2 base Blink Timing that commits a lots of resources to Stalkers and no resources to upgrades or tech, so your follow-up will be quite slow. If your attack does damage and you keep most of your units alive, then you can start 2 more Assimilators, 2 Forges, and a Templar Archives, in order to transition into a Chargelot/Storm unit composition with Blink Stalkers to help deal with drops. However, if you do not deal some damage with your initial Stalkers, then you will be behind both economically and in tech against an opponent who will have Stimpack and Medivacs soon to follow.

Tips

- Do not bother Probe scouting early on because you can do this build against nearly everything your opponent chooses to open with.
- With your initial Stalkers, either protect your main base from a Reaper scouting your Twilight Council or move out and poke up at your opponent?s base for some early scouting intel.
- The limiting factor with this build is Blink Research?s build time and finishing your 6 Gateways, so be sure to Chronoboost Blink Research constantly in order to attack as soon as possible.
- Keep your Mothership Core out of harm?s way.  Use its 14 sight range for high ground vision, but do not commit the Mothership Core in the attack because without high ground vision, your attack will most likely fail.
- Do not forget to use your Mothership Core?s Time Warp ability to help pick off SCVs or Bio units that are out of position.
- Do NOT over-commit your Stalkers in a risky blink. Only aggressively blink to get up to a high ground or to pick off a Siege Tank/Widow Mine before it activates.
- Constantly warping-in more Stalkers to reinforce your army and add strength to the attack is key to crushing through your opponent?s defenses.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong build because of how quickly you get both high ground vision with your Mothership Core and enough Blink Stalkers to do real damage ? after opening with a 1gate FE. While your opponent might have Stimpack done in time for the attack, you can still beat your opponent in the open field if you use Time Warp and Blink appropriately.

However, this build commits a lot of resources to the attack, so transitioning into standard play will be much further behind if you had just rushed for High Templars and upgrades.

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker(s) back to the protection of your Sentry quickly if you have to defend an early attack.
The majority of your scouting comes from your Hallucinated Phoenix. Your phoenix should be able to get into your opponent?s main base and determine what tech route you see your opponent going.
- If your opponent is expanding quickly, then consider warping in Stalkers non-stop from a proxy Pylon as you all-in your opponent with a Blink all-in. Should you choose to expand instead, you will be slightly behind economically ? but with Blink.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then be sure that you do NOT over produce Stalkers.  Instead, expand and fall back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.
- If your opponent has a Stargate, then be sure to not take damage against early Phoenix or Oracles by initially positioning your Stalkers defensively. You can expand quite easily behind your Blink play and go into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame or all-in your opponent if you spot them taking a fast expansion behind the Stargate.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then consider getting a Robotics Facility instantly in order to make one Observer for detection against DTs. If you are sure your opponent is also opening with Blink, then constantly produce Immortals and defend a natural expansion OR skip the Robotics Facility entirely and try to win the Blink Stalker vs Blink Stalker micro war.

Transitions

This build is a very safe opener that allows you either to all-in your opponent with Blink Stalkers or transitions into a macro game quite easily. However, the actual steps you take to transition into it often depend completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with. This is why scouting with the Hallucinated Phoenix and generally being active on the map with your Blink Stalkers is crucial.
If you choose to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly produce Stalkers 3 at a time from your proxy Pylons and attack as soon as Blink Research is finished (@7:40ish). Bait out a Planetary Nexus and/or kill the Mothership Core and as many Sentries as possible before fully committing to an attack. If your opponent is on one base, you can still expand at home ? using your Sentry to force field the ramp to stop his army from coming down and engaging you with his entire army.
In Twilight vs Stargate macro games, abuse your mobility to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you have a strong midgame Chargelot/Immortal/Archon army ready. In Twilight vs Robotics macro games, again abuse your mobility to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you get a healthy Chargelot/Archon count up.  Keep tabs on your opponent?s tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Twilight vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponent?s potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by getting a Robotics Facility and producing Observers/Immortals or by winning the Blink Stalker vs Blink Stalker position battles in the open field.
The most common way to start the transition into Chargelot/Immortal/Archon is by starting a 2nd Nexus, a Robotics Facility and 2 more Assimilators, a Forge for +1 Ground Weapons, and Zealot Charge research in that order. Add on the Templar Archives and Archons when you can afford it.

Tips

- Once you start your Mothership Core, save your chronoboost so that you can dump it all into Blink Research. Only 1 or 2 chronoboosts should be spent on Warpgate (unless you spot your opponent going for very early aggression).
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial Stalkers to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap?s 3gate All-in).
- Against Stargate play, be sure to position your units to defend your mineral line from potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- If you choose to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly chronoboost Blink and then later your Gateways to get the maximal amount of units out with Blink as soon as possible. Bait out a Planetary Nexus and/or kill the Mothership Core and as many Sentries as possible before fully committing to an attack. If your opponent is on one base, you can still expand at home ? using your Sentry to force field the ramp to stop his army from coming down and engaging you with his entire army.
- If you choose to expand behind this build, do not produce more than 8 Stalkers which you should use to take map control and poke your opponent?s front. Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases. Transitioning into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon unit composition is very strong.

Pros and Cons

This build is a versatile, aggressive build that can pressure your opponent or defend basically any all-in with Blink Stalkers. It gets a fast Hallucinated Phoenix scout your opponent?s main base and let you know if you need detection, should reposition your army, or all-in your opponent.
However, this build requires a lot of scouting information to be executed effectively, so getting a Hallucination into your opponent?s base is crucial.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Duckdeok 3gate Robo', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a 3 Stalker Rush to take map control, and follows up with a 1base 3gate Robo in order to pressure you opponent, get detection, and play safe against Blink/Stargate builds. This pressure build produces somewhat stable macro games if you react appropriately to your scouting information.

Scouting

For all early game scouting, please refer to the Scouting section of the 3 Stalker Rush build.

After your initial units have scouted around your side of the map, the majority of your scouting will come from your 3gate pressure at your opponent?s base.

- If your opponent is fast expanding, then attempt to cancel the Nexus before it finishes. Warp in more units at your proxy Pylon for extra pressure.
- If your opponent has just as many (or almost as many) Gateway units as you, immediately fall back and begin Immortal production. Against either Gateway attacks or Blink All-ins, you need a high Immortal count in order to defend.
- If your opponent does not have as many Gateway units as you, then push up the ramp and attempt to kill his army. Do NOT over-commit once your opponent has activated Photon Overcharge. If you cannot push up his ramp, then warp-in a Sentry or two at his natural and set up a contain while you expand back at home. If during the contain a Stargate unit flies into your base, be sure to activate your Photon Overcharge in order to keep your Probes alive.

Transitions

Once you have set up or a contain or you are forced to retreat back home, be sure to setup your natural expansion. Going into the macro game, however, the actual unit composition of your army very often depends completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with.  If your opponent stays on one base for too long, then throw down more Gateways, constantly make units, and prepare to defend your natural with Stalkers, Immortals, and your Planetary Nexus. In Robotics vs Stargate macro games, quickly switch into Blink or double Stargate play of your own so as to not lose against any Void Ray based armies. In Robotics vs Robotics macro games, Immortal count and/or Colossus count are the most important things. Keep tabs on your opponent?s tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Robotics vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponent?s potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by producing Immortals+Gateway units or Colossus for defense.

Tips

- Split your initial chronoboost on Probes and Warpgate Research in the early game so that you are not economically behind but still have a quick Warpgate attack.
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial 3 Stalkers to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap?s 3gate All-in).
- Against fast tech plays, your initial 3gate pressure should give you information on both the type and timing of your opponent?s attack. Be sure not to over-commit your Stalkers here, however, for Blink or Immortal all-ins will be able to hold your attack and counter-attack with a lot of force if you are careless with your initial units.
- Against Blink play (or your opponent has a lot of Stalkers when you pressure), be sure to pull back immediately and start Immortal production.
- Against Stargate play, use your Photon Overcharge to push back any Oracles or Phoenix if your Stalker army is out of position.
- Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very versatile, safe build that takes advantage of early Gateway units to apply pressure as well as defend every sort of all-in that can hit you. It also gets detection and Immortals for defense against ground-based all-ins, so very often you have a more stable opening than most other PvP builds.

However, this build forces you to be active on the map with your initial units. If you over commit your army unnecessarily or do not interpret your scouting information correctly, late all-ins can be very hard to stop.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,MothershipCore,Stalker,Stalker,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,Probe,Stalker,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Pylon,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:24 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'FanTaSy Mine Drop into Banshee', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This aggressive build hits your opponent with relentless harassment, either outright winning the game or giving you a considerable economic advantage before even entering the midgame. Also, with Widow Mine and Banshee play, this build force a lot of scans  giving you another sort of economic advantage going into the midgame.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your 1st Refinery so as to check whether your opponent is opening Reapers or not. Against a Reaper player, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe and try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or an expansion at your natural with your first Marines.

Your next scout will come with your Widow Mine Drop. With this drop you can check what your opponents opener is. Against a Banshee player, you can following through with the build and trying to out-micro him in Banshee vs Banshee harass, or you can cancel your banshee and start a Viking and Engineering Bay for a Turret to play safe. Against a Hellbat Dropping player, make a few more Widow Mines to position them defensively against any incoming drop as you use your Widow Mine Drop and incoming Banshee to out-harass him. Against a player going for a similar Widow Mine Drop, you can either pull back and try to defend or attempt to do more SCV damage with your drop than he does with his.

Finally, when your first Banshee starts its harass, you will get a good look at everything else your opponent is doing when trying to transition into the midgame. Keep an eye out for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either Marine/Tank or Mech play quite easily.

When transitioning into Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production early in order to have a safe defense and later strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use.
- Keep your eyes peeled for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop a drop or Banshee. Do NOT drop on top of an active Widow Mine.
- With your initial Widow Mine drop, avoid Turrets at all costs. The main purpose of the drop is to force multiple scans, with a side goal of dealing crippling economic damage.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that were already weakened by the initial drop before attacking any of the full health SCVs.
- If your opponent has a Missile Turret already set up in his mineral line, then do not worry. Instead, camping a Terrans production with a Widow Mine and several Marines can be just as effectiveespecially with the Banshee follow-up that hits soon after.
- Always favor keeping your Medivac and Banshee alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural. You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very strong, aggressive play style that opens up with unrelenting harassment before even entering the midgame. With a Widow Mine drop and Banshee follow-up, you can kill many SCVs and also force your opponent to scan often  giving you another type of economic advantage. Finally, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for opening with a 1/1/1 grants you the freedom to go into nearly anything.

However, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades. Also, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,Factory,Refinery,CallMule,SCV,Marine,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,Starport,WidowMine,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,WidowMine,Medivac,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnStarport,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,Banshee,CloakingField,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,Banshee,TechLabOnFactory,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:24 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'DT-Robo into Archon-Blink push', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'So this build has become more and more popular in PvP recently and this blink follow up is a really fun way to end it early since they will usually play greedy if they see you expand so you can hit pretty hard.

The opening is pretty simple and straight forward and easy to execute. The dark shrine can be proxied or it can be put in base. On 4 player maps its best to proxy it since you can put the proxy in a base far away from theirs while already on your scouting path so it's pretty convenient and you can pull some cute mindgames with a fake chrono on the twilight to fake blink if they scout you.

This build is pretty much safe vs any opening. Vs fast WG attacks you use overcharge to buy enough time to get the DT's out so you can defend and harass at the same time and abuse their lack of detection. If they're smart they will see your lack of units and start a late robo or forge, however you can usually keep it from finishing with how early your DTs come out.

Vs standard robo expands your nexus will be a little bit later, however you can either make up for this by using warp prism/DT harass or doing the blink follow up to abuse their low production capability.

Vs blink you obviously just kinda win so that's always nice.

Stargate openers are the only real problem. If they go phoenix they will usually scout with the first one and will be able to pick apart what you're doing. In which case you can just play more conservatively and get extra gates before you expand to be sure you don't die to a phoenix/gateway all in. Use the DT to determine if he's expanding or not so you can react properly. If they bank the phoenix then you basically just win.

If they go for oracle pressure they sometimes can just win if they're good at identifying early and remember to leave an oracle at home. Otherwise you can usually hold it off decently well but it is definitely the most burdensome to deal with (besides proxy oracle, which just blows in general.)

If they go DT's too then you have that weird thing where you just kinda continue normally as if nothing happened. That's why you get the robo obviously so you don't die vs their potential DTs.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'DeMusliM Reaper FE', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This HotS Reaper FE, optimized by Flash and DeMusliM, gets out exactly one Reaper for scouting and a ridiculously fast Engineering Bay for an early +1 Infantry Attack in order to hit a 10 minute timing with +1/+1, Stimpack, and Medivacs.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (opening with a Reaper FE means that you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they expand (or note if they do not get a fast expansion by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Also, if you do not know whether or not your opponent has built a Stargate, taking advantage of your ridiculously fast Engineering Bay to build a Missile Turret is not a bad idea too.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and Medivacs.  After this build, secure your 3rd Command Center, continue your upgrades with +2 Infantry Attack, build 6 more Barracks (for a total of 8), and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to go into a strong, late game army. Your fast third Command Center and early upgrades means that your late game army will be much stronger than your opponents assuming that you are able to deny their third base with your initial Medivac poke.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important  be sure to mine exactly 100 Gas so that you have enough for the Reaper and Reactor and no more.  Getting your natural Command Center up before the 2nd Supply Depot is a major strength of this build.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add a 2nd Bunker at the front, and consider getting a Missile Turret in each mineral line. 
- Oracles, even with an expansion, massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you have to instantly get out one Missile Turret per mineral line.
- The gas timings of this build are somewhat more delayed than what you might be used to if you usually play with a gasless 1rax FE.  Therefore, be sure to cut all Marauder production until after your Starport has completed.
- Try not to take any huge engages against your Protoss opponent with your initial Medivacs unless you are sure you can do damage.  With only 2 Barracks producing units, and such a fast 3rd Command Center, your army is not designed to outright win the game  rather to further your economic and upgrade advantage in order to win the game at a later point.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because it gives you the economy and infrastructure on par with a Wings of Liberty style 1rax FE. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Not to mention the fact that you also get a ridiculously early Engineering Bay in order to kick start your Bio upgrades very early. This build also takes no detours and goes directly into Bio+Medivac play, so your Stim+Medivac aggression happens much sooner than if you go for early Widow Mines.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes, especially if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that with such a low Marine count in the early game, fast Oracles can do a lot of damage if your scouting/Missile Turret timing is not perfect.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Bunker,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,EngineeringBay,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SCV,OrbitalCommand,Barracks,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,Factory,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Refinery,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,StimPack,SCV,SCV,Starport,DoubleMarines,Marine,ReactorOnFactory,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,ScannerSweep,Marauder,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,InfantryArmorLevel1,CallMule,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marauder,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Armory,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,CommandCenter,CallMule,SCV,SCV,DoubleMedivacs,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CombatShield', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:25 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Gas First Cloakshee Expand With Hellion Scout', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This gas first Banshee opener used by INnoVation and many other top level Korean Terrans opens with the fastest Cloaked Banshees possible. The Banshee(s) are used to stay safe against early attacks as well as harass your opponent, in order to get an economic advantage going into the midgame.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your Orbital Command to check whether or not your opponent is opening with Reapers. Against an opponent opening Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe; thus, you should try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or expanded at your natural with your first few Marines.

Sacrifice your hellion on 35 supply to get intel + allow yourself to get more scvs while supply depot is building.

Against another Banshee player, follow-up your first Banshee with a Raven (and then potentially Viking if extra anti-air is needed). Against a Hellbat dropping player, make a few Widow Mines to burrow defensively against any incoming drop, as you use several Banshees to out-harass him. Against a player going for a Widow Mine Drop, position your Marines defensively at home and be sure to have enough scans to deal with his Widow Mines. Building a Raven might be useful, but not until after you have 2 Banshees with which to harass your opponent.

Finally, be sure to keep an eye out on what midgame transition your opponent is doing. Look for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either all-in, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play quite easily.

For an all-in transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory and start Siege Tank production instantly. When you hit 2 or 3 Siege Tanks, grab all of your Marines (>20), your Banshees/Vikings, and attempt to break your opponents front with a slow siege push.

It is possible to go into Marine/Tank or Mech after a 3 Command Center follow-up if you are sure your opponent will not be going for any more early game pressure. Start a Raven in order to save enough minerals to afford 2 Command Centers and then transition into either Marine/Tank or Mech just as below.

When transitioning into macro Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production after you start a 2nd Command Center. That way you have enough defense early and later can have a strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use. Against 2rax Reaper, you should delay your Tech lab until your Factory has completed at least one Hellion. Otherwise you might straight up die before you even start your first Banshee.
- Watch for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop your Banshee as you enter your opponents base.  Cloak your Banshee as soon as you see any potential for burrowed Widow Mines.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that are undefended by a Turret. If you are transitioning to a 1/1/1 all-in, then be sure to target-fire Marines as well, for this directly strengthens your attack.
- Always favor keeping your Banshee(s) alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two. You can also repair a weakened Banshee at home with SCVs if you can keep it alive.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural.  You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This gas first Banshee build is an aggressive opener in TvT. Also, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for you are able to transition into an all-in, 3 Command Center play, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play. Also, this build requires a lot less APM than other TvT builds, so it can be very useful for lower league players.

However, this build is extraordinarily weak against early Reaper builds because you open with so few Marines. Also, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind your opponent in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades, especially if they open with a fast expansion. Finally, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,SCV,Factory,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,Refinery,SCV,Marine,Starport,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Hellion,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,LiftRaxFromTechLab,Marine,LandStarportOnTechLab,CloakingField,CallMule,Banshee,SCV,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,WidowMine,ReactorOnBarracks', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:25 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Harstem 1 gate FE to Blink-Colossus', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a 1gate FE, and transitions directly into both Blink and Colossi. With these two tools you can safely secure your main and natural from both frontal pushes and backdoor drops.

Benchmark: When your first Colossus finishes (@9:00ish), you should have 1 Colossus, 3 Stalkers, a Sentry, a Mothership Core, 2 Observers, and around 50 Probes.

Scouting

This build is a safe build that gets detection and a lot of early game Stalkers, so Probe scouting is unnecessary. Use your initial Stalkers to ward off any of your opponent?s Reaper(s) or scout the front of your opponent?s base if they are opening with a Command Center First.

Most of your scouting will come from your 2 Observers. Send the first directly to your opponent?s main in order to spot what infrastructure is being built. Send the second to a common attack or drop path so that you have vision of when your opponent is moving out.

Against early Widow Mine drops, position your units defensively and consider delaying Colossus production in favor of more Observers.

Transitions

With Blink, Colossus, and Observers, you should be able to safely secure your main and natural expansions. Against bio play, consider getting 4 or 5 more Gateways while continuing your upgrades and taking your 3rd base as soon as you are safe to.

Alternatively, you are also able to go for a 2 Base, +2 Blink Stalker/Colossus all-in with this build.  Simply get your Ground Weapons upgrades instead of Ground Armor, and throw down 7 more Gateways after you start your Colossus production in order to break your opponent with simply Stalkers and Colossi.

Tips

- Chronoboost your Nexii constantly in order to get an economic advantage.
- Use your initial Stalker(s) to ward off any opposing Reapers and/or take a Xel?Naga Watchtower to see a push coming.
- Position your Robotics Facility, Forge, and Twilight Council in a central location to prevent them from being killed during a drop.
- Your Observers are the main way you can position your army to adequately defend multi-pronged aggression ? replace them if they are scanned and lost.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with both Blink Stalkers and Colossi, rushing for all the tools you need to defend Terran aggression.  With strong upgrades and a mobile unit composition, this build allows you to enter the midgame ridiculously quickly.

This 2 base, Hatchery-tech Roach-Speedling all-in crushes through Void Ray-less Stargate or heavy Gateway Protoss openers, both out of a Gateway Expand or Forge Fast Expand.

Scouting

Send your first Overlord to scout your opponent?s natural wall to spot for a Forge Fast Expand or Gateway Expand, and then send it to a safe area for a later 7:00 scout.  Consider using your 2nd Overlord to guard your natural expansion against Cannon Rushes. Your next Overlords can be placed around your opponent?s main or natural base as backup scouts or for vision of their 3rd base.
Use your initial Zerglings to scout around the map for Probes and proxy Pylons. Keep a Zergling outside his front to scout for any early pokes, and avoid any Stalkers or the Mothership Core whenever possible.
The majority of your scouting will come from the Roach/Ling all-in. Note whether or not your opponent has opened with a Stargate, Robotics Facility, or Gateway-heavy army, and react accordingly.

Transitions

This build is a 2 base Roach/Ling all-in off of only 27 Drones, so there is no well defined transition. That being said, if the attack is not going well, be sure to pull back and keep your units alive, instantly resume Droning, and attempt to secure a third base and 3rd Queen.  Going for Lair and Roach Speed or Hydralisks is probably your best way to defend the inevitable counter-attack, but you might be too far behind (based entirely on how much damage your all-in did) for it to be enough.

Tips

- Be active on the map with your initial few Zerglings in order to deny vision of the fact that you do not have a 3rd Hatchery (and especially that you have mined more than 100 gas just for Metabolic Boost).
- Roaches take up a lot of supply, so be sure to start several Overlords BEFORE you need to make the 8 Roaches.
- During the all-in, keeping up on your injects so that you have enough Speedling reinforcements could be the difference between a close game and an easy slaughter.

Pros and Cons

This is a very strong 2 base all-in that uses Roach/Ling to crush your opponent before the midgame has even started. It also requires little scouting and little APM to perform well, so it is a great build for newer players to perform as well.
However, if your opponent spots your lack of third base early on, they should have enough time to wall off their natural with Photon Cannons if they opened with a FFE or get out enough Sentries if they opened with a Gateway Expand.

This build opens with a Gateway Expand and then transitions into light Gateway pressure in order to start the macro game with an economic advantage. Also, this build gets both a Stargate and a third base quite quickly for a Chargelot/Void Ray or pure Sky-toss unit composition in the late game.

Scouting

After the early game, be sure to scout for early Roaches from your opponent. If your opponent is performing an early 2 base all-in, then warp-in Sentries and make Void Rays from your Stargate instead of being aggressive with your initial 6 units. If your opponent has taken a third base or shows NO signs of aggression, then be sure to set up your proxy Pylon as soon as you can for the attack to hit before Zergling Speed can finish.

When you are attacking with your initial 6 units (2 Stalkers, 3 Zealots, and Mothership Core), your opponent must defend with whatever units he has. With this extra scouting information, be sure to react appropriately. If your opponent has opened with Roaches, then be sure to start Void Ray production earlier. If your opponent has opened without Zergling speed, then be sure to continue the 3gate attack, reinforcing with Zealots and Stargate units when you can. If your opponent has opened with Zergling speed, then be sure not to over-commit to the attack; rather, pull back and start your Stargate production appropriately. Also note that if you kill a Queen or two, you should reinforce with an Oracle first due to your opponent?s lack of anti-air.

Depending on how your attack has gone (especially if your opponent defended with opening fast Roaches), then you might not feel safe to take such a quick third Nexus. Instead, start a Forge and a few Cannons at your natural in order to play safe.

Transitions

This build is a macro build, so don?t commit multiple warp-ins to the initial 3gate attack unless you are confident in its success. Following up with the appropriate Stargate units and taking your 3rd Nexus/extra Assimilators is much more important than dealing a killing blow with these units.

HerO follows up this attack with a Forge and several Cannons at both his natural expansion and 3rd Nexus. He then starts 2 more Stargates and both Assimilators at his 3rd Nexus in order to make a mass Void Ray army. With his economic advantage, he ensures that no standard Roach/Hydra timing attacks can kill his Sky-toss army until it is already too powerful.

However, it is also possible to play with an sOs style transition, favoring mass Chargelot and only several Void Rays in order to make a beefier ground army.  Again, start a Forge (or two) for Cannons at the natural expansion and 3rd Nexus as well as for Ground Upgrades. Then start at least 4 Gateways for a healthy Gateway count and a Twilight Council to begin Zealot Charge before taking your 5th and 6th Assimilators at your 3rd Nexus.  Add in High Templar/Archons instead of more Void Rays as your gas count allows it.

Tips

- Because this is a macro build with only light pressure, commit almost all of your chronoboost on both your Nexus throughout the build.
- With your initial Stalkers, be sure to clear any stray Zerglings around your base that might scout your build. Then defend the building proxy Pylon until your first warp-in.
- As soon as you start your Stargate, you need to send out a Probe in order to set up an aggressive proxy Pylon
- During your 3gate attack, use your Stalkers to target-fire any Queens your opponent might use to defend with. If you can kill a Queen or two, then follow-up with an Oracle to deal a lot of damage. Also, be sure to use Time Warp on any Queens or Roaches so as to minimize your opponent?s mobility in the fight.
- Do NOT over-commit multiple warp-ins to the 3gate attack unless you are confident that you can do damage. Each warp-in that you use slows down your 3rd Nexus timing by at least 20 seconds.
- If your opponent defends with fast Roaches, then consider starting a Forge and several Cannons at your natural expansion before you take the 3rd Nexus.

Pros and Cons

This macro build is strong because it opens with some light aggression for harassment and scouting, while taking a rather quick 3rd Nexus behind it. Also, it is a safe Gateway Expand build because your 3gates and Stargate together are enough to defend most early Zerg all-ins. Finally, this build uses a Stargate for some decent harassment, a deterrent for Mutalisks, and an opening for a strong unit-composition in the midgame.

However, this build requires solid macro while simultaneously performing a timing attack, so may be quite hard for newer players. Also, this build is somewhat weak against a Zerg who takes minimal losses during the 3gate attack and is able to follow-up with a +1/+1 mass Speedling attack to kill your 3rd Nexus.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Nexus,MothershipCore,WarpgateUpgrade,Pylon,Stalker,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Stargate,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Phoenix,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,VoidRay,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Nexus', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:26 PM;

Build is extremely aggressive and start off aggressive early on as well. In this one the initial zealot and MSCore are sent directly to the zergs 3rd to do some harassment. The whole goal of this build is to keep the drone count as low as possible before doing the full immortal/sentry push and this is stage 1 of that goal. You send the zealot/MSCore to his 3rd to maybe pick off a drone or even a queen but also to force an early set of lings. Losing the zealot will be almost inevitable however do NOT lose the MSCore. That will make your little poke 100% not worth it. You may not always be able to do this push as sometimes the zerg will open gas early and will have speed out by this time, so make sure you're scouting to see exactly when the gas goes down.

Part 2 of the "keep the drones low" goal is with an early warp prism pressure. Most immortal/sentry all ins don't have this step in it, they just go right for the attack and let the zerg drone and make whatever he wants before the attack. This little drop of 1 immortal and 2 sentries (preferably behind the mineral line in an abusable location) forces even MORE things that aren't drones as well as allows you to kill a decent amount. If you're good with your micro as well you can keep the drop going by going into the main and doing a FF drop and warping in (as your first 4 gateways will be done at this time) however that option may not always be available. Also be sure to bring the MSCore with this drop, if things go terrible wrong you can always recall which is why it's important to not lose the MSCore in the initial poke.

All the while this pressure is happening you're going up to 3 immortals and 9 gateways and making a ton of zealot/sentry and moving across the map. If you can keep him pre occupied with the warp prism all the while you're moving across the map then that's even better. However your goal is complete at this point. You were successfully able to keep the zerg on a low drone count that isn't quite what they want to deal with an all in with this and forces a lot of units that they don't want to use in the engagement either.

You use the zealot to help ferry the probe across the map and keep the pylon alive so you can get a zealot warp in and then have your oracle follow up afterwords. You either should target and timewarp the queens he has trying to defend the 3rd, and then clean them up with the oracle, or bait them all down and then go in to a queenless mineral line to get a ton of drone kills. It's all up to your judgement.

After that youcgo for very fast charge, archons, and +1 attack and then zealot/archon timing to kill the 4th base of the zerg. It hits at such an awkward time that the zerg never expects it and you're taking a 3rd behind it as well so they don't even think you're going to attack.

The other reason it's so good though is because zealot/archon at that stage in the game is probably the best unit comp per cost vs anything the zerg could have made. If they try to go formass lingsat that stage to hold off the zealot pressure, then zealot archon is obviously going to destroy that. If they go forhydrasthe count won't be high enough and as long as you can trap them with FF's you'll destroy them as well. If they goroachesthen you probably can't end them with this push, but if you can get good forcefields and get the zealots in the faces of the roaches then you'll do quite well since zealots are actually better vs roaches if they can get in their face (which is what charge + FF does). If they goswarm hostsyou'll hit right as they're popping usually so they'll be in quite low numbers. You can do a good amount of damage before you have to pull back to an observer from the robo you made while pushing. The only big trouble with this build is mutas, however like the swarm hosts you'll be hitting as they pop. With 3-4 archons and a wave of stalkers afterwords you can easily deal with low numbers of mutas. If they are able to get a good 12-13 at once you're gonna have to back up and immediately make 2 extra stargates and start phoenix production.

If you don't end the game with the zealot/archon push then you can simply transition into whatever tech is required vs what the zerg chose. You can start warp prisms with the robo you made and then go into colossus and blink, or you can make warp prisms and continue down TC path with storm and then add some void rays.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'HerO greedy blink into DT drop', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'Early game opening

The build starts off very standard. It's a normal 1 gate FE blink opening. You get your twilight council on 29 supply after 1 stalker and then a 2nd stalker afterwords. Lately people have only been going 2 stalkers in the early game instead of 3 so that way they can fit in 2 gateways at 36 supply while opening blink as well. This would make it so that the 2 extra gates (3 in total) would be finished right when WG was done. Before that, literally everyone opened 3 stalkers but with a later 2nd and 3rd gate that didn't quite finish when WG was done. This build is a best of both worlds and what I assume might become the standard now for defensive blink openings. herO goes for a 2nd gate at 34 supply instead of 2nd and 3nd at 36, which allows him to still get the 3rd stalkerfrom the gateway. Then once WG is finished researching, he warps in 2 more to get that nice number of 5 which is what you would get normally anyway. So you basically end up at the same thing (just with 1 less gateway since you aren't planning on being super aggressive with the blink) but now with 3 stalkers early to help defend instead of 2. It's a small little variation, but a rather useful one to give you that nice defense of 3 stalkers before WG is finished while still ending up with a nicely timed tech and gateway count.

One other important thing to note: herO onlychronoboosts his blink research ONCE. Yeah...only once. That's very rare. He instead puts all chrono into his probes to get full saturation and simply waits for blink to finish. So basically you can completely focus on chronoing probes if you want. If you forget to chrono blink once it doesn't even matter cause apparently not even herO does that sometimes with this build.

Extra tech and mid game transition

With every defensive blink opener we need a robo right? Luckily for us, herO gets the timing for the robo down absolutely perfectly. Literally the earliest we could need an observer after a standard 1 rax reaper FE is around 8 minutes. When does the observer come out of this 6:35 timed robo? 8 minutes. This will allow you to defend any 1 rax reaper FE into factory builds with relative ease (as long as your control and map awareness are on point) and give you a strong edge going into the mid game.

All the while this is going on, a very sneaky and early timed dark shrine has been placed at 7:30. This is earlier than the Trap build I used in the past (which went down at about 8 minutes), which adds to the greediness of this build. This earlier dark shrine allows you to time up a nicely executeddual pronged attackwith7 stalkers and 3 DTs in a warp prism. This is showcased brilliantly vs Flash from Proleague. As you drop the DTs in, you also do some poking with the blink stalkers at the bunker or any SCVs near the front. Or you can do it visa versa. Distract and fake blink all in by poking at front bunker --> drop DTs into main. He continues doing this for quite a long time which allows him to do the next step in the build.

While this DT/blink harass is going on, herO makes some decisions that REALLY enforces the greedy aspect of the build. Not only does he get a robo bay AND two forges during the 8th minute, he also EXPANDS at 9:20.He is heavily relying on his blink/DT harass to scare of the Terran to allow him to get away with this.He even starts +1/+1 BEFORE a colossus. At 11 minutes into the game his unit count is literally 61 probes, 1 DT, 1 colossus, 7 stalkers, 1 warp prism and a MSCore. If the Terran makes a strong defense of the blink/DT harass then a counter attack is extremely lethal and potentially game ending. If you don't feel safe being this greedy, then by all means delay the 3rd base and get a few gates before hand while you get a colossus and a sentry or two. Most terrans will want to be attacking you more often than not so it's better to play a little safer on ladder anyway. This build obviously is being done this greedy due to the fact that herO is playing against Flash.

Late game

The build transitions quite easily into late game. After your 3rd is saturated you get a nice gateway explosion of up to about 12-14 or so. You start +2/+2 right when 1/1 is done and then a Templar Archives shortly after for storm. herO also gets warp prism speed for some random reason. I guess he just feels he has the money to get it so he does. I personally would prefer observer speed since it's a little more helpful (since warp prisms are fairly fast already now) and if you're going to spend your money on something like that at that point in the game, it might as well be for observer speed since it's so vital later on. However, from there it's a fairly standard PvT game.

You open with a forge expand, do a normal stargate oracle opening and instead of transitioning into robo you just get a twilight council after your 4gates and 3rd base. You then go up to 10 gates in total (4 starting, 2 at 3rd, 4 at 10:00) and a robo to round out your composition. The oracle should keep him back for a bit in the early game as well as give you enough information to know exactly what kind of follow up he is going for. The 4gates before 3rd and 6 sentries off of them will give you a nice defense vs early roach and or ling play to try and cancel your 3rd. Sometimes you'll have to give it up, however with the proper response (shown in one of the linked VODs) you can still end up winning.

The cool thing about this build is how versatile it is. Like I said, it has early pressure (which most fast +2 blink builds don't) while still being able to defend at home with sentries. It also deals with any sort of follow up very well with little deviation. If they're massingroaches(but a little bit later) you can just add in someimmortalswith your main blink/sentry force. If they gohydrasyou can go into colossiwhileabusing forcefieldsto take their armyin chunksif they attack earlier. If they gomutasthen you simply spam the fuck out of your warp gates with non stop stalkersand thrust them down his throat. You might need some cannons at home to defend if they go for a base trade but you should be able to just break them if you attack quickly enough.

Since the swarm host nerf you hardly even see them anymore. They aren't hard to deal with at all. You can respond in the same way said below, but it's not nearly as difficult as described.

Them goingswarm hostsis when it gets a little trickier. You'll need tobuy as much time as possiblewith your blink/sentry force while you tech up todouble robo colossi.

It' requires some decent multitasking as well as a good understanding on how to play the mass harass style vs swarm hosts.

Otherwise if they just kind of sit back and macro in a non swarm host way, then you just do some harass with the blink/sentry squad and warp prisms while going up to colossi anyway.

You then transition into a few more sentries and gates while taking a 3rd and youpressure him with sentry stalker. This part of the build is very similar to the old PartinG fake 3 base 7 gate build, however you're still macroing behind it.

The goal with this attack is to justforce units and make him think you're all inning(which you aren't) and if you catch him off guard you can definitely kill the 3rd. It's just to set up for the next attack that comes.

Transition to mid game

The transition is quite simple and the "in" thing to do right now. You simplyget +2 and blink and then attack. Basically every Korean protoss is doing this right now and it's winning games left and right. There's not really a good answer to this for zerg other than getting vipers which are easily dealt with by high templar. So with a critical mass of blink/sentry you can cut up roach/hydra indefinitely and you should be able to win whatever fight. It's also great for cutting up small spaces so you can snipe hatches better.

Whatever damage you did with the first push should give you a timing to hit with the 2nd push. So long as youdon't over commit and lose more than you should(recall when you think you're starting to lose too much) you should be in good shape.If they're super preparedthen you simplyuse the 2nd push as a pokeand threaten to kill him while you're simply macroing up on 3 bases going into templar tech and harassing with the warp prism.

It starts out with a similar idea of keeping drone count low with an early pressure before the actual all in. The zealot/stalker poke at the beginning this time is more to focus down queens than anything else, even if you get the health on it low that's better than nothing because the plan is to follow up directly after with the oracle. An oracle beats a queen one on one, however it will have low health, so if you can lower the queens health initially you can snipe it very quickly with the oracle after and get some juicy drone kills. Or best case scenario you actually kill the queen with the zealot/stalker and you just get a crap ton of drone kills.

This part is quite micro intensive so I would suggest practicing the timings of this build vs the AI multiple times first so you can get the timings for all the gateways down. However the follow up is extremely simple and doesn't require too much explanation. Try to sneak a probe out on to the map while the oracle is doing work so you can really surprise them with the follow up warp gate attack as soon as possible.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'HuK 5gate Warp Prism Attack', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with 2 Stalkers and a Mothership Core to take map control, and then follows up with a Warp Prism and 5 Gateways to drop the main of your opponent and force field him out of his own base.

Benchmark: When your Warp Prism finishes (@7:05ish), you should have around 32 Probes, 2 Stalkers, 4 Sentries, 1 Warp Prism, and a Mothership Core.

Scouting

This build is most effective against gasless openers from Terran, and quite ineffective against 1 base plays. Thus, be sure that you confirm your opponent doing a Reaper FE, CC First, or 1rax FE build with either your Probe scout at 13 supply or with your initial Stalker poke. If your opponent has not opened with an expansion, then abandon the Warp Prism and go instead for 2 more Assimilators, a Robotics Bay, double Forge, and standard macro PvT play. If your opponent has opened with an expansion, then proceed with this build and be sure to force field your opponent out of his main base.

Transitions

This build is a strong, 5 gate attack off of 2 bases with only 2 Assimilators.  Thus, you have to damage with this attack if you want to go into the midgame with an advantage. Assuming you do no damage and you lose the Warp Prism, you will have a very hard time coming back in the game, and should play stupidly greedy if you want a chance to come back. If you do some damage with this build but eventually lose everything, then you might still be in the game; transition by getting both Assimilators at your natural and go into a standard Colossi/Forge midgame. If you do a lot of damage and save some of your army with the Warp Prism, then you can feel free to take a greedy third base instantly while transitioning directly into Colossi+upgrades off of double Forge.

Tips

- Use your initial Stalkers and Mothership Core for map control and early game scouting. Only build the Warp Prism if you are playing against an expanding Terran. Get your natural?s Assimilators and go into Colossi if you see your opponent staying on one base.
- Against Reaper play, keep at least one Stalker at home in order to defend your Probes and/or stop him from seeing your Warp Prism.
- When you finish your Warp Prism, load up your 4 Sentries instantly and head directly for your opponent?s main base.
- Poke your opponent?s front with your Stalkers before you go into the main with your Warp Prism to make sure that your opponent has all his units at his natural.
- Drop your Sentries on the high ground near your opponent?s ramp to instantly force field him out.
- Transform your Warp Prism into Phasing Mode and constantly warp-in 5 units at a time, favoring Zealots and Sentries.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with your Stalkers/Mothership Core to easily defend Reapers as well as take map control. Then, with the scouting intel that your Probe and Stalker poke give you, you follow up with a very early Warp Prism and 5 gate attack in order to drop in your opponent?s main while you force field him out. Against a non-expand build, you have the Robotics Facility and can get Observers or Immortals to play safe.

However, opening with this build delays your midgame tech by a lot. By only staying on 2 Assimilators, you do not have the gas income to go into Colossi instantly, and thus have to rely on your Warp Prism doing damage to get a leg up on your opponent. Also, this build relies a lot on early game scouting in order to ensure that your opponent is going for a standard expansion into Bio play.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,MothershipCore,Stalker,Chronoboost,Probe,Nexus,Probe,RoboticsFacility,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Chronoboost,WarpPrism,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpInSentry,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInSentry,WarpInSentry,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:26 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'HerO oracle-phoenix into HT', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'This build is quite good for Catallena specifically. Since the ramp is so small you can easily forcefield it off and be slightly greedier with your opening (so long as your reaction times are good) and the phoenix cater to the large amount of drop area.

The build opens with a standard oracle for some harassment and scouting. Very normal and cool. It goes into a fast 5 phoenix after the oracle to further harass (if you want to reveal them) and also shut down drops early on to keep you safe to tech up to templar. HerO does both. I've seen him reveal them after 3 to start doing some harassment with the oracle (usually if they open delayed mines so you can pick up the mines and continue harassing) or he will keep them hidden like vs Polt (someone he knows loves his drops) so you can catch some medivacs for free.

After that you go into charge and an archon or two to get your 3rd up. This is going to be the hard part to stay stabilized. This is when terran will try to really pressure you to keep you off 3 bases and away from storm. This is why HerO gets a decent gateway count before taking the 3rd as you will need as many units as possible to keep them away and your 3rd safe.

Once the 3rd is set and you have storm you should have a decent time keeping terran back as you try a storm drop or two while you tech up to colossi as well to abuse any lack of vikings. I prefer to add a 2nd robo as well when the colossi tech up starts so that way you can really hit with a hard transition of suddenly 2 and suddenly 4 colossi instead of just getting one and slowly go up. It's much easier for terran to transition himself when you only do 1 colossus at a time so if you do double robo you can open a timing window for yourself if the terran isn't scouting/reacting properly.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'HerO Speedprism colossus drop into storm drop', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'This build is kind of crazy. Like I said it's a bit challenging butif you want you can just incorporate the main ideasof the build into your own standard robo openings that you're familiar and comfortable with. The build starts with a fancy 2 gas opener with probes being rallied in 1 at a time after you have full mineral saturation. If anyone remembers a long time ago the SaSe aggressive 3 gate opening that Day9 did a daily on, it's very similar to how the gasses were filled in that build. Whether or not it's better to do it this way or to just do a normal 2 in each or 1 with 3, I don't really know. I'm sure you can get to the same out come with whatever gas opener you're familiar with but if you wanna be try hard and feel cool then go ahead and try this method. I personally found it quite smooth when I tried it.

Now the build starts with a normal robo timing just like any other standard opening. The natural gasses are a bit earlier however since the build is quite gas intensive (you'll also need the extra gas for 2 sentries while teching up heavily to be able to defend). That's another thing you can simplify if you'd like if you don't think you'll remember to fill the gas up later on. Once the robo bay is done you'll get your first colossus but instead of getting range you get warp prism speedto aid in your colossus drop harassment. Since we aren't committing fully to colossus we won't need range this early and instead we put that gas towards a fast twilight council to go into storm for a 2nd form of harassment in the storm drop.

Once your harassment with the colossus starts you should be getting a few extra gateways to prepare for any medivac timing the terran may want to use. Your extra resources should also be put into some immortals while you wait for your tech to get up. You should also be sure towarp in 2 HT's when you start storm so by the time storm is done you can immediately go and use them for the storm drop.So once storm is done, bring the colossus home and switch it for the HT's and go for round 2 of your wonderful harassment. You can also warp in archons at home to help defend and bolster your army. You'll have quite the beefy army with immortals and archons and storm with 1 colossus. If you remember the old rangeless colossus into storm builds, this is very similar to that except that you're doing harassment with the first colossus.

From the storm drop you simply add on more gates as you feel necessary and get the upgrades and charge going and transition into a normal macro game. You get your 3rd when you feel safe and you can transition into 2 robo colossi whenever you feel comfortable to throw the terran off even more.

Simplifications/Alternative Follow ups

If you feel the colossus drop into storm drop is a little too much for you (opening storm these days isn't always the easiest thing in the world) then you can very easily just continue down the colossus tech route.The extra resources you will bank by not going twilight tech can be used for earlier gateways or earlier double forge. Or you can go into twilight still and go for blink for an easier drop defense option.

Something else you can do is do a big7gate colossus all in like Classic did vs Polt on Nimbus at Blizzcon.

If you still want to go down the storm route but feel like you're kind of skimping on defense by loading your first to HT's to do a drop, then you can also easily justplay more passive after the colossus drop.You can play it like the old rangeless colossus into storm builds like I mentioned and wait for the terran to sac a little bit into your unexpected storm transition. At that point you should feel more safe to incorporate some storm drops into your play.

Again, while this may not be the most solid or perfect build, it is a way to freshen up your games and force you to try some fun early game harassment that normally you aren't able to do.

If he scouts early and sees your proxy, you should go with the first zealot otherwise he's going to have more than enough time to prepare for the 2nd one.

From there you should chrono out as many stalkers as you feel necessary. If you think you're pressure is being held easily then stop making them and focus on a transition back home. If you are dealing a lot of damage then continue chronoing them out.

Back home herO goes for 2 more gates for even more aggression once warp gate is done (and ends up winning the game with it) as well as a robo for protection vs DTs and for a stable follow up if the 3gate follow up does not kill him.

The reason for robo over anything else is because:

He saw a twilight council so the threat of DTs is there. Also his twilight would be too late for blink vs blink so going for immortals is safer.Stargate always has the possibility of losing to DT and blink (especially since blink is so common now and a common follow up to a held proxy)DT is too easily expected after a failed proxy

So robo is the safest option. If you scout certain things like a stargate or robo then going for blink or oracle respectively will obviously be good in those situations.

This build opens with 5 Stalkers to apply pressure to your opponent and scout for what they?re opening.  It then follows up with a Stargate Expand, allowing you to reactively counter your opponent?s opening tech.

Benchmark: When you Stargate finishes (@6:30ish), you should have 24 Probes, 5 Stalkers, and a Mothership Core.

Scouting

Because of how low on minerals you are, you cannot afford to Probe scout.Thus, all of your scouting comes from your Stalkers.

Being active with your initial 3 Stalkers around your natural, third, and watchtower will prevent your opponent from sneaking proxy Pylons past you and hitting you with a very fast Gateway unit attack. Also, with your mobile army, you can head directly at your opponent in order to scout what units they have made and even attack them if they are attempting to expand quickly.  Your 5 Stalkers (with high ground vision from your Mothership Core) must scout what your opponent is doing, so that you can react accordingly with your Stargate in the midgame.

- If your opponent is fast expanding, then produce an Oracle from your Stargate and attempt to pressure the front with your Stalkers as your Oracle does damage in the main.
- If your opponent has multiple Sentries out, then attempt to bust up the ramp with your Stalkers to force him to use Force Fields to defend his ramp. The most likely scenario is that your opponent is making a Robotics Facility behind their Sentry count. However, it is also possible that your opponent is making a Stargate instead.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then make an Oracle or two and keep them in their base by threatening to kill multiple workers if they leave.
- If your opponent has a Stargate of their own, make constant Phoenix and position your units very defensively to deal with early Oracles.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then make one Oracle to stay defensive with in case of DTs. Afterwards, you can make up to 3-4 Phoenix for map control and harass potential, but quickly transition into Void Ray/Immortal to stay safe against Blink play.

Transitions

This build transitions into a macro game very easily. However, the actual unit composition of that macro game very often depends completely on what build your opponent has chosen to open with. If your opponent stays on one base for too long, then throw down more Gateways, constantly make units, and prepare to defend your natural with Void Rays, Stalkers, (possibly Immortals), and your Planetary Nexus. In Stargate vs Stargate macro games, quickly go up to 2 Stargates constantly making Phoenix and get a Fleet Beacon for the Phoenix Range upgrade. In Stargate vs Robotics macro games, use your Phoenix or Oracles to get an economic advantage, while transitioning into Sky-toss or a Phoenix/Blink all-in. In Stargate vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponent?s potential Blink or Dark Templar harass, as you transition to Void Ray/Immortal for defense or pure Sky-toss.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very safe build that gets quick map control with 5 Stalkers early on for safety, aggression, and scouting. With accurate scouting information, it then transitions into Stargate play and expands so that you can play a reactive macro game with a strong economy.

When you are out on the map with your first Stalkers, however, your opponent might sneak an Oracle into your main base. Be careful that you are only aggressive when you can be aggressive and only use your Stalkers for scouting when you cannot be aggressive. Finally, this build requires a LOT of scouting information to be executed well.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,GasProbe,GasProbe,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Pylon,Stalker,Stalker,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,Probe,Stalker,Probe,Stargate,Probe,Pylon,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon,Probe,Oracle,Probe', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:27 PM;

This 12 Roach Rush is a timing attack designed to cripple a Terran economy, transitioning into a further all-in or macro play as needed.

Scouting

There is only minor scouting necessary with this build before you hit your opponent with your 12 Roaches. Simply ensure that your opponent is not cheesing you with an 8-8-8 opener or proxy 11/11 Rax.
Once you are committed in the attack, be on the look-out for signs that your opponent is going for a full-on macro play (3 Command Centers), some sort of Hellbat aggression (Armory), some sort of Banshee play (Techlabbed Starport), or normal Bio play (multiple Barracks). Your upcoming transition requires you to both do some damage and later handle any counter attack potential from your opponent without losing much yourself.

Transitions

Depending on what you are most comfortable with and what you scout your opponent doing, you can transition into a later all-in or macro play yourself. Note that regardless of whichever path you follow, you will have to do some amount of damage with your attack or you will be behind both in terms of economy and tech.
If you are transitioning into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk play, stop all Roach production, and get a Lair, Metabolic Boost, and 2 Evolution Chambers as soon as possible. Getting Mutalisks out to defend 3 bases from drops as you tech towards +2/+2 Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk with all the necessary upgrades is how you?ll get ahead in the midgame.
If you are transitioning into a Roach based midgame, try to avoid making many more Roaches after your initial 12 roach opener. Instead, focus on securing 3 Hatcheries, 2 Evolution Chambers, and teching for a Speed Roach/Speed Hydra midgame (with potentially Swarm Host/Viper lategame).
If you are transitioning into another all-in, your best best is some sort of Roach based army with splash damage (such as a Roach/Bane all-in). Do note that any follow-up all-in will be particularly weak against Banshee or Widow Mine defenses.

Tips

- As you get to your first 100 Gas, if there is still a scout in your main base, consider fake researching Metabolic Boost. Be sure to cancel if before you get to 28 supply and need to start your Roach Warren.
- Don?t over-commit to making Roaches. Only make 12 and then be sure you are getting the necessary 2 base economy, Overlord count, and creep spread back at home while your attack is commencing.
- The point of the attack is to cripple your opponent, but if the attack does not go too well, there is no retreat; your follow-up depends largely on your ability to scout what your opponent has opened with and react/defend accordingly.

Pros and Cons

This aggressive build can outright defeat opponents that are macroing too hard or do not scout and react adequately. Opening with 12 Roaches gives your early game a muscle that not many other ZvT builds give you, giving you great denial of any Reaper/Hellion openers as well.
However, this build does put you behind both in terms of economy and tech if your attack does not do damage. In order to equalize the game, you must do some sort of damage as well as drone up back at home to crush your opponent later in the game.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,RoachWarren,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:27 PM;

The cool thing about this build as well since it's less all in, is that if it gets scouted you can easily transition out of it and harass with an immortal drop or a sentry drop in the main and FF the ramp. This is because of the fact that you actually get the natural gasses.

Just a few things you have to remember about this build is that you have to be aware of speedling all ins. This is because your natural wall off is going to be a bit later than most builds, so you want to be sure that nothing is hitting you before you can get it down. If needed you can wall off quicker if you see something coming.

Also make sure you hide your robo fairly well. If a zerg sees that fast of a robo they're going to expect something so it's best to hide it as much as possible.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'INnoVation 2 Base SCV Pull', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

Designed specifically to kill most Protoss players during the mid game Templar transition, INnoVations SCV pull hits at around 14 minutes with MMM, Vikings, SCVs, and 2/1 upgrades.

Scouting

The first ten minutes of the game is a standard TvP Reaper FE, so scouting and reactions proceed as normal.

First, SCV scout, 15 supply at the latest, to see if you are being 10 gate Zealot rushed. Then follow up with your Reaper scout, checking pylon count, assimilator count, gas mined, and MSC/Stalker/Nexus timing.

Your early Engineering Bay allows for equally early Missile Turrets, so you should be able to build a turret in your main base and position marines in your natural mineral line in the event of an Oracle attack.

Against a delayed Protoss expansion (4:10+, no Nexus), always build a bunker.

Against a fast expanding Protoss, poke with your first Marauder and 8-10 Marines to force overcharge and to gauge his army size.

This initial poke will reveal the following possibilities:

- Little to no Gateway units: Possible double forge (proceed as normal) or Dark Templars (build turrets and bank one scan minimum).
- No obvious Observers: Confirm Twilight tech. If your opponent is going for Templar instead of Colossus, immediately abandon the build and do a biomine parade style using a reactored Factory and five barracks before your third Command Center. SCV pulls are a poor choice against Pisonic Storm.
- More Stalkers then usual: Possible Blink Stalker aggression. React accordingly with bunkers and mines. Consider hiding your small poke squad at his third or fourth, and counter attacking when he moves all his stalkers and his MSC to your side of the map.
- Phoenixes: Phoenix Colossus is by far the most likely choice, but constantly scout to see if the Colossus count is rising. If it remains at one or two for very long, be cognizant of the possibility of a feint into Templars.
- Healthy Gateway unit count: Proceed as normal.

These above are only a few examples, but the most common. Against most styles that involve Colossus (single forge, double forge, blink colossus, phoenix colossus, etc) you will be able to simply play as normal and execute the all in without any problems.

For lower level players, please be advised all scouting reactions as written above are general assumptions made against players attempting optimal strategies. You will be blindsided by sub optimal and often illogical strategies quite often, but you should be able to compensate with superior macro and mechanics.

Transitions

As with any all-in, there is no transition unless you have done a significant amount of damage.

If your attack fails, there is no transition; you will die almost immediately to any counter attack, or you will be contained to two bases and slowly starve to death.

If your attack succeeds in mostly destroying Protosss army, but you cannot finish off your opponent, retreat and rally defensively. Continue your upgrades, maintain consistent worker production, and add a third command center and a Ghost Academy, if necessary.

Tips

The main objective of this push is to successfully engage and destroy his army decisively. Your SCVS are there to absorb just enough Colossus volleys to allow your Vikings to destroy all the AOE and your MMM to shoot through the Gateway buffer.

Again, to emphasize, your objective is to destroy his army decisively, not to destroy his third, or his natural, or snipe any tech. You are to take one crushing victory with your army before beginning to do any eco or tech damage.

During the actual engagement, be sure to have your SCVs in front of your main army. Attack in as wide of a concave as you can form, and make sure that your Vikings are shift A-clicked across his Colossus.

Do not attempt any drops or secondary attacks. Your attack needs to be as strong as possible along a single front for the highest chance of success.

Pros and Cons

The first ten minutes of this build, as mentioned above, are identical to a standard Reaper FE, making this a particularly tricky all in to scout. Additionally, this build has the benefit of blind countering some two base Colossus all-ins because it gets Vikings so quickly, and in such high numbers.

That being said, just as with any all-in, if scouted and identified, this build loses a lot of its potency. A faster than normal Templar transition and increased Sentries for force fields are both popular and effective responses against scouted SCV pulls.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,EngineeringBay,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,SCV,Barracks,SCV,DoubleMarines,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SCV,CallMule,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,TechLabOnBarracks,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,StimPack,Marauder,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,Factory,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marauder,CallMule,SCV,SCV,InfantryArmorLevel1,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Starport,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnFactory,DoubleMarines,Marauder,SCV,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SupplyDepot,Refinery,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,CombatShield,SupplyDepot,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMarines,CallMule,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,Armory,CallMule,Barracks,Barracks,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,ConcussiveShells,SCV,SCV,CallMule,TechLabOnBarracks,ReactorOnBarracks,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,InfantryWeaponsLevel2,SupplyDepot,CallMule,Marauder,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleVikings,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,Marauder,Starport,CallMule,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleVikings,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,CallMule,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Viking,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleVikings,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,CallMule,Marauder,Marauder,Viking,DoubleVikings', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:27 PM;

Invented by Flash but refined and popularized by INnoVation, this Reaper/Hellion 3CC variant is by far the most popular on ladder and is considered by the majority of Terran players to be the most standard of macro builds. Its versatility has stood the test of time, and the current version below will be continually updated as INnoVation continues to optimize it again and again.

Scouting

You can open with this build regardless of what your opponent is doing, so SCV scouting is unnecessary. You only need to SCV scout if you want to confirm that your opponent is opening Hatchery First and want to start a Bunker at their natural in order to begin Reaper/Bunker pressure.

The rest of your scouting will come from your Reapers and then later Reaper+Hellions poking the front and forcing your opponent to reveal what units they have in order to defend your attacks. Note: Ling Speed will finish around 3 minutes after your opponent takes an Extractor. Thus, if your initial SCV/Reapers see your opponent taking gas, be sure to send your Reapers back just before those 3 minutes are up and wait for some Hellions before attempting to engage Speedlings in the open field.

In case your Reapers or Hellions spot your opponent making Roaches or going for a Roach Warren, immediately cancel your next pair of Hellions and begin making Widow Mines and Marauders. Having your Widow Mines positioned effectively, and using SCVs to tank damage or repair your Bunker will be all you need to stay alive.

Be prepared to throw the timings of the second half of this build out assuming any serious aggression, such as a Roach Bane all-in.

Transitions

This build transitions well into both Marine/Tank or Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine because it sets up the basic infrastructure needed for either of those and gets Stimpack.

The above transition involving double barracks after hellions followed by double ebay is the standard transition. In the event of an extreme all in, such as Roach bane, immediately begin marauder, mine, and bunker production. Against a strong Roach timing it is advised to begin tank production while slightly delaying either your Starport or Engineering Bays; this is most demonstrated notably in INnoVations series against Hyun in the WCS 2014 Global Finals.

Another great transition if you have done some damage with your Reapers or Hellions is going for a Hellbat/Marauder follow-up attack. How Dragon does this is throw down an Armory as soon as you start your 3rd Command Center, and then make Hellbats constantly as soon as the Armory finishes.  Starting two Engineering Bays and going for a +1/+1 Marauder/Hellbat push is a great way to keep up the aggression against your Zerg opponent. Keep in mind that this sort of 3CC Hellbat aggression is far weaker than a two base committed Hellbat push.

Pros and Cons

This build was originally intended as an aggressive opener backed by strong macro. In modern TvZ, however, any competent Zerg player will easily deflect Reaper Hellion pressure with minimal losses, and gasless three hatches are becoming increasingly rare due to the benefits provided by opening either Speedlings or Roach aggression. As such, the major pro of this build should now be listed as the amount of information that the Reaper can provide; because Zerg cannot proxy any tech, you should be aware of what Zerg is doing most of the time. In this way, opening Reaper/Hellion is inordinately safer than simply opening Hellions, if only because of the information difference.

The weakness of this build traditionally had been hyper aggressive openers, such as fast Speedling rushes (which can be deterred by bunkers between your 2nd CC and your main ramp), Roach/Bane busts (which can be held with bunkers, repair, and either mines or hellions with Marauders), or even fast Muta play (which INnoVation countered by simply pushing at his normal time with three missile turrets at home).

The new biggest threat against this build, however, is Roach timings. Simply put, this build focuses very heavily on Hellion production, and delays all other AOE quite significantly (usually up until around 11+ minutes). As such, 1-1 Roach Busts, or fast 2-2 Roach Hydra max out attacks, or even Roach Hydra into Brood Lords are all excellent examples of builds in which players should quickly identify, cut Hellions, and immediately begin adapting their builds for the situation.

Learning this Build and the Difficulty Curve

This build is undoubtedly one of the hardest macro builds to learn in the game. Besides its extreme adherence to timings and linear sequences, it is also extremely punishing in every aspect; INnoVation has refined this build to the point of impracticability; over queueing means delaying Hellions; delaying Hellions delays your Barracks, delaying your Barracks delays your starport, and delaying your starport delays your entire 1-1 push. In short, a single mistake has many more long lasting impacts as opposed to a standard Terran build.

To go about learning this build, it is important to work on only one section at a time and to not try to do everything at once when you first start off, else you will immediately fail.

In the order of things to focus on (#1 being top priority, and #8 being the lowest priority)

1. Worker Production
2. Not getting supply blocked, not over queueing, and proper rallies for all structures
3. The build itself (for example, starting Hellions before 5:30, or double E-bay and 2nd gas geyser at 7:40) and its relevant timings
4. Taking your Third base on time
5. Scouting
6. Keeping your Reaper Hellion alive
7. Harassing
8. Micro (Sniping the first creep tumor, catching the transfer of drones to the third base, weakening Queens to force transfuses and decrease tumors, sniping active tumors, runbys, etc.)

In short, always defer to the priorities, and only move down the line as you can accomplish the others. Even if you kill 32 Zerglings with your Hellions, it is irrelevant if you Medivacs finish at 12 minutes instead of 10:20. Even if you land your third base at 8:30, it is irrelevant if you only have 26 SCVs at the time instead of 40-50 that INnoVation might have. And even if you plant every structure down perfectly at the allotted times, supply blocks, over queueing, poor rallies, and suboptimal worker distribution also grind this entire build to a screeching halt.

Scouting

This macro build is a greedy build, so scouting for all-ins is important.  However, you cannot afford to (nor have any need to) scout with an SCV before 17 supply. When you get to your opponents base, check whether they have a natural expansion started at or before the 5 minute mark. If your opponent has not started a Nexus by around the 5 minute mark, and they have both gas geysers, then you can assume they are performing an all-in with either a Twilight Council or Stargate. Be prepared to delay your 3rd Command Center in favor of 2 more Bunkers at the front (or main if your opponent appears to be doing a Blink all-in) and/or a Turret per mineral line to deal with Oracles.

All of the midgame scouting will come from you pushing out and taking the middle watchtowers, attacking the front, and dropping the main once you have Medivacs out. Simply noticing what units and unit composition your opponent is using to defend should give you enough information about their midgame plans to make informed counters.

Because of how much infrastructure and time has been spent on Bio play in this build, the only possible follow up is going for more Bio play and adding in Vikings+Ghosts (and Hellbats or Widow Mines for the late game) as you take more bases.

To transition into standard Bio play, get another Engineering Bay and an Armory to continue double upgrades, add-on a Reactor and Tech lab onto your 4th/5th Barracks, get all of your third bases Refineries, and throw down either a Ghost Academy or a 2nd Starport depending on whether your opponent is going for Colossi or High Templar.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong build because of the powerful economy you kick start with your initial CC First and quick third. Also, by avoiding early Widow Mine drops or harassing units and focusing completely on getting upgrades and Bio, your army is considerably stronger at the 10 minute mark than most other TvP builds. Finally, this build is strong because you get a fast Engineering Bay and excess minerals, and thus have the opportunity to throw down Bunkers/Turrets to deal with any sort of 1 base aggression that a Protoss player can throw at you.

However, this build is only safe if your scouting is effective. Misjudging that your opponent is going for a macro game instead of an all-in can cost you the game instantly. Also, there is no opportunity with this build to apply pressure before you finish Stim and Medivacs at the 10 minute mark because it is focused on economy instead of pressure.

Tips

- The main strength of this build is the economic advantage. Do NOT miss SCVs as you are taking bases and macroing up.
- You cannot afford to scout before 17 supply in order to afford the CC and Barracks on time, but scouting what your opponent is doing in the early game is crucial, so be sure to send an SCV to scout soon after you reach 17 supply.
- Build another Bunker or two at the front if a scan or your SCV scout finds that your opponent has not started an expansion around the 5 minute mark.
- If you are playing completely blind, build a Missile Turret in each mineral line to defend against the possibility of Oracles before they could possibly arrive.
- Once you have Stimpack and Medivacs, push out instantly to try and deny a third base from your opponent and/or get scouting information about what midgame tech choice your opponent is committing to. However, keep in mind that you are on 3 Orbitals, and so remember that your economy is far ahead, but your army supply is not.

This macro build order opens with a quick 3 Hatchery opening to get a strong economy and then transitions into a Tech-heavy army in order to stay safe against early attacks and lay on the aggression to Protoss before the late game starts. This build maxes out on Roach/Hydra/Viper in order to crush your opponent?s army or deny their 3rd/4th base.

Scouting

Scout with either Overlords, Zerglings, Overseer, or Changelings when your Hydralisk Den goes down. Send them into either the main base or the 3rd base in order to see if Protoss is going for a tech-heavy composition (Colossus/Void Ray/etc) or a Chargelot-heavy composition. If they are going for a Chargelot heavy composition, instantly throw down a Banelings Nest, start Baneling Speed, and max out with around 16 Banelings in your unit composition.
Besides this, all mid and late game scouting comes from the Roach/Hydra/Viper pokes or attacks that you will perform. React appropriately by either re-maxing with Ultras or Swarm Hosts. You will need a 5th base to fully support any Hive-tech re-maxes.

Transitions

There is no ?transition? per se. If you can win the game with this push, then be sure to attack in an open position, use Blinding Cloud or Abduct appropriately, and take the game quickly. If you cannot win the game outright, then fall back on your 4/5 base economy and tech switch to whatever best counters your opponent?s army. Note that you should get a lot of static defense in order to stay safe during your super late game tech switches between Mutalisks, Swarm Hosts, and Ultralisks.

Tips

- If your first Overlord scouts your opponent going for a Gateway expand, then you should abandon getting the third base, instead getting an Extractor and starting Metabolic Boost before taking your 3rd.
- If your natural gets Pylon blocked, then you can make an early Overlord at 15 supply instead of the Hatchery in order to buy some time against it. If your opponent lets the Pylon finish, then simply making 4-6 Zerglings to take the Pylon down should be enough of a commitment before returning back to the build.
- Being thorough about checking for early proxy Pylons across the map with your early game Zerglings is crucial against early Protoss timings. Being able to spot aggression and stop it before it can even begin is the easiest way to avoid quick losses.
- Be sure you send in an Overlord scout at 7:00. Spotting your opponent?s midgame tech informs your next step with this build(whether it be more Drones, a Hydralisk Den, or Spore Crawlers).
- Vipers will be usable (Consume finishes) 3:30 after your Infestation Pit starts.
- Scouting for a heavy Chargelot composition before you max can be quite important. Throwing down a Banelings Nest and maxing with several Banelings can be the difference between a quick loss and a sure win.
- Once you have re-maxed on Ultras, starting a Spire and tech-switching between Mutalisks and Swarm Hosts/Ultras is a strong way to win in the very late game. Also note that you should get a lot of static defense when performing these late game tech switches.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a hugely economic opening while still being safe. It then transitions into a Viper-based defense in order to secure your 4th base and quickly max out on Roach/Hydra/Viper.
This build however requires constant scouting in order to be safe.

This build opens with a 9 Pool in order to apply a lot of early pressure to your opponent and keep them on one base, and then transitions into more macro oriented play with a Speedling follow-up.

Scouting

All of your scouting comes from your initial Overlords and your 10 Zerglings.  First scout where your opponent has spawned by sending your Overlord directly to one of the possible bases. Then use your first 6 Zerglings (with more rallied) to poke/prod your opponent?s base.
If you see your opponent?s natural Hatchery nearly done, then they have performed a Hatchery First opener and you can choose either to ignore the natural and attack their workers in the main or to focus exclusively on the natural and plan to bring it down. Note that you MUST do economic damage one way or another with your 10 Zerglings or you will fall behind economically.
If your opponent?s natural Hatchery is only just started, then they have performed a Pool First opener. Focus on canceling the natural Hatchery ? you won?t be able to do much damage in the main before their Spawning Pool finishes.
If your opponent does not have a natural, then go up into the main and check their gas count. Prepare against 1 base play of either Banelings or Roaches by focusing much more on Speedlings and potentially getting a Spine Crawler.

Transitions

You can use this opener to transition into any form of Zerg play. If you want to end the game immediately, you can put Drones back on gas and go for a 1 base Ling/Bane all-in.
More standard play ensues by starting your natural expansion as soon as possible and making only as many Speedlings as needed to be safe and have map control. For a Roach midgame, start a Roach Warren and Lair after your first 100 gas. Then, on 3 gasses, you can start Roach Speed and +1 Attack. For a Mutalisk midgame, get a Lair with your first 100 gas and saturate your 2 bases and 4 gasses as soon as possible. Start your Spire as soon as your Lair finishes.

Tips

- Attack his Drones in his main if he has performed a Hatchery First opener
- Attack his natural expansion if he has gone for a Pool First opener
- Scout his main if he has gone for a 1 base build
- Do NOT make too many Zerglings. It may seem tempting to try and kill your opponent with constant reinforcements, but slow Zerglings lose their effectiveness very quickly. Drones are much more important.
- Be sure to pull off of gas once you have mined 100 for Metabolic Boost. You need all of your Drones mining minerals in order to boost your economy into the midgame.

Pros and Cons

This build opens up with a 9 Pool in order to situate aggressively in a matchup known for its early game volatility. It also gets Metabolic Boost at a standard time, while still allowing for both macro or all-in transitions.
However, this build is obviously a lot less economical than most other ZvZ builds, so you must do some sort of economic damage with your initial 10 Zerglings or risk falling behind.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,CancelExtractor,Drone,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Queen,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,MetabolicBoost,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Overlord,InjectLarva', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:27 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'INnoVation Reactor Hellion 3CC', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This CC First build gets a ridiculously fast 3rd Command Center, taking your economy immediately into the midgame. Using Reactor Hellions for map control and scouting information, this build is also reasonably safe; your Hellions let you quickly react to any Zerg all-in and Widow Mines + 3 Orbitals provides a reasonable defense.

Scouting

Instead of worrying about early game Zerglings, Innovation just builds his Command Center on the high ground, and finishes a wall-off with the initial Barracks. Thus, Innovation does not scout at all until his first Hellions pop.  With these Reactor Hellions he takes map control, clears out any Zerglings at watchtowers, and pokes Zergs front to spot the Zergs third base, any buildings at the front, and any units that Zerg is making.

- If you see a ton of Speedlings, then make sure your Hellion micro is on point. Feel free to pull back behind your natural wall in order to more effectively deal with Speedlings.
- If you see Roaches, then immediately cut Reactor Hellion production and start making Widow Mines two at a time. Make a Marauder, and consider cutting SCVs in order to complete a wall-off at your natural and prevent your opponent from running past your Bunker/Widow Mines.
- If you see two Evolution Chambers, then assume your opponent is playing a macro game.
- Alternatively, if you see a third base, then you can also assume your opponent is playing a macro game.

After any early pressure is spotted or not spotted, lift off your third Command Center and take your third. Use your Hellions and Marines (now with Stim) to secure it. All mid-game scouting will come from your incoming push with your first Medivacs.

Transitions

This build transitions well into both Marine/Tank or Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine because it sets up the basic infrastructure needed for either of those and gets Stim, +1/+1, and Combat Shields. Its infeasible to transition into Mech because of how much infrastructure and time you have already committed to into Bio upgrades.

For either transition, secure your third base, take both Refineries at your third, start +2/+2, and produce a lot of Marines. When transitioning into Marine/Tank, start a Tech lab on your Factory as well as a second Factory to kick start your Siege Tank count. When transitioning into Bio/Widow Mine, produce a Reactor on your Factory and start cranking out Widow Mines as you abuse your mobile Marine/Medivac force to apply pressure to your opponent. A +2/+2 timing attack with several Siege Tanks or several Widow Mines, and a lot of Marines is a very strong timing to hit.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a ridiculously economic opener  CC First into 3 CC.  However, this build gets Reactored Hellions quite quickly in order to take map control as well as stay safe against early Speedling timings. Also, your Hellions are quite useful in terms of the scouting information they give you.

However, this build is somewhat weak to early Roaches.

This 3 Hatchery opening transitions into a strong Speedling/Hydralisk timing to hit the third base of Protoss before its economy can kick in. It then tech switches instantly into Spire or Roach/Hydra/Viper play to best counter the unit composition Protoss has used to defend the pressure.

Scouting

Once you are into the midgame, all of your scouting will come from what your opponent hits you with, and then later your Ling/Hydra timing attack. Assuming your opponent has opened with Stargate play, you will either see Phoenix harassing your Overlords/Drones or a Void Ray for defense while your opponent tries to take a third. As soon as you have confirmed your opponent going for Stargate play (either with an early Overlord scout or by any of the above cues), you can choose to go through with this build.
When you are attacking your opponent?s third base with your Ling/Hydra timing, be sure to note your opponent?s unit composition. Against Colossus play, throw down a Spire. Against Stargate play, keep making Hydralisks. Against Blink play or a strong ground army, transition into Roach/Hydra/Viper play or continue with a Ling/Hydra unit composition and +2/+2 upgrades.

Transitions

This build is designed to tech switch as soon as you spot the unit composition of your opponent, so it has quite a few transitions. In all cases, as you are moving out with the Ling/Hydra timing attack, be sure to start your 4th Hatchery.
If your Ling/Hydra timing runs into a Colossus, start a Spire and take 2 more Extractors at your 4th Hatchery. Go for a hard Mutalisk switch to catch your opponent off-guard and keep applying pressure/harassing your opponent?s Probes, while you take the map and transition into the late game. Killing off any Phoenix during your Ling/Hydra timing will strengthen this transition dramatically. Going for a Hive instantly and getting Vipers can be strong against Colossus play too.
If your Ling/Hydra timing runs into a Chargelot/Void Ray or pure Skytoss unit composition, then be sure to keep making Drones and out-expand your opponent OR keep committing to the fight by rallying more and more Hydralisks and Speedlings in an attempt to break your opponent. If you choose to macro and out-expand your opponent, a Roach/Hydra/Viper unit composition with 2 Evolution Chambers is quite standard ? so start +2/+2 Missile upgrades and Hive tech as soon as you can.

Tips

- If your first Overlord scouts your opponent going for a Gateway expand, then you should abandon getting the third base, instead getting an Extractor and starting Metabolic Boost before taking your 3rd.
- Also, if you feel unsafe opening with a Hatchery First against a Forge First Fast Expand, then feel free to open with a Pool First into 3 Hatchery Opener and transition into this build in exactly the same manner.
- If your natural gets Pylon blocked, then you can make an early Overlord at 15 supply instead of the Hatchery in order to buy some time against it. If your opponent lets the Pylon finish, then simply making 4-6 Zerglings to take the Pylon down should be enough of a commitment before returning back to the build.
- Being thorough about checking for early proxy Pylons across the map with your early game Zerglings is crucial against early Protoss timings. Being able to spot aggression and stop it before it can even begin is the easiest way to avoid quick losses.
- There is no need for a Roach Warren if you spot your opponent going for a Forge Fast Expand into Phoenix build, as Jaedong scouts when beating Dear at the WCS Finals.
- During the Ling/Hydra timing, be sure not to fight in a choke where force fields will split your Zerglings from Hydralisks.
- During the Ling/Hydra timing, spread your army to help reduce Colossus splash damage. Target firing any Colossus or getting on top of the Robotics Facility is a great way to perform game-ending damage.
- Start your 4th Hatchery before the fight so that your transition is backed with maximal economy.  Perform the tech switch reacting to your opponent?s unit composition as soon as you can.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a hugely economic opening in order to fund a 3 Base Ling/Hydra timing to crush your opponent?s 3rd Nexus. It also does not commit much to the attack, allowing you to tech switch instantly and counter the unit composition your opponent has chosen to defend their third with.
However, this build is weak to early pressure, for you skip the Roach Warren for safety against early 2 base Protoss attacks.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Jim 1 gate FE to Phoenix-Colossus', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a fast expansion in order to get an economic advantage, using an Oracle for harass potential and defense until you can setup a Phoenix/Colossus midgame unit composition.

Benchmark: When your Robotics Facility finishes (@7:00ish), you should have 1 Oracle, 1 Stalker, 1 Sentry, a Mothership Core, and around 37 Probes.

Benchmark: When your 2nd Colossus finishes (@10:00ish), you should have 2 Colossi, 3 Phoenix, 1 Stalker, 3 Zealots, 2 Sentries, and a Mothership Core with over 50 Probes.

Scouting

Feel free to Probe scout after you build your Gateway in order to determine what your opponent is building. The majority of information about what Terran is doing however will come from what your opponent hits you with.  If you spot a Reaper coming into your base, then try and stop it from seeing your building Stargate with your Stalker and Mothership Core (do not worry too much if it is spotted however, for your Stargate is only initially being used for one Oracle). If you do not spot a Reaper, then send your Mothership Core and use its huge sight range to spot what buildings your opponent has inside of his base before returning home.

The majority of your midgame scouting will come from your Oracle. Use it to spot whether your opponent is opening with Bio, going for fast upgrades, fast triple Command Center, or strong 2 base timing. If you see an opening, then the Oracle can be used to harass your opponent?s SCVs, but the true purpose of the Oracle is constant scouting through the midgame. Your opponent?s 3rd base timing is especially useful as a good benchmark for when you should try and take your 3rd base.

Transitions

The build transitions into a Phoenix/Colossus midgame, with a standard Colossus/High Templar/Archon late game. As soon as you spot your opponent taking his 3rd base, secure a third of your own, then start 2 Forges and several more Gateways. Keep producing Phoenix and Colossus until you have around 7 of each (7 is a LOT for a normal game, but the heavily delayed High Templar tech means that you have a stronger army in the midgame), supplementing your army with Zealots when you have extra minerals. Finally, when your +1/+1 is halfway done, be sure to start a Twilight Council for +2/+2, Zealot Charge, and Templar Archives in order to reach your lategame army.

Tips

- In the early game, you are attempting to get your economy up enough to support Phoenix/Colossus on 2 bases.  Be sure to chronoboost your Probes constantly until you need to divert chronoboost to your Robotics Facility/Stargate.
- Against Reaper play, position your initial Stalker and Mothership Core defensively.  Try to deny it scouting your Stargate, but don?t worry if it is scouted?the Stargate is only initially used for one Oracle.
- The main purpose of your initial Oracle is for scouting. While it is true that you can kill several SCVs if your opponent?s Marines are out of position, do NOT sacrifice your Oracle for a few extra kills. The constant threat of harass and ability to scout for the first 10 minutes of the game is a lot more important than an extra SCV kill or two.
- Position your Phoenix defensively outside your main (to absolutely shut down any midgame drops) up until you are ready to take your third.  If/when your Oracle dies, use your flock of Phoenix to take map control and kill several SCVs with any extra APM you have.
- Take your third base and start 2 Forges as soon as you spot your opponent taking his 3rd base.
- Build more Colossus (up to 7) than you normally would (around 4). With the extra air support tanking and killing Vikings, your Colossus count must be quite large in order to take out your opponent?s Bio army.

Pros and Cons

This build gets out an early Oracle for harass potential and constant scouting. It also gets a strong economy and uses a midgame Phoenix/Colossus unit composition to defend drops and bio pushes with ease. This midgame composition is quite robust in terms of defending your third as well as stopping constant Medivac harass.

However, this build is short on Gateway units for the early stages of the game. Thus, any early drops are quite hard to stop unless you are able to scout them beforehand and prepare appropriately. Also, you do not start your Forges until you start your third base, so you will often be behind in upgrades against a macro-Terran.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,MothershipCore,Nexus,GasProbe,GasProbe,WarpgateUpgrade,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,Probe,Stargate,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Probe,Oracle,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Observer,RoboticsBay,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Observer,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,ExtendedThermalLance,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Phoenix,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Phoenix,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Phoenix,Chronoboost', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:27 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Jaedong Roach Drop Nydus All-In', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This all-in hits your opponent?s main with a lot of speed Roaches. However, Jaedong puts his own clever flair on this traditional ZvT All-in by using an Overlord Roach Drop to guarantee his Nydus follow-up is successful.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of very early force, position your Queens to defend your natural and consider getting a Spine Crawler. Banshee play may be an issue with only 2 Queens, but such a fast Lair means you will have a very quick Overseer.
The next scout will be with your initial Roach Warren attack. Terran will be forced to defend his main with all his units, so you?ll see either Bio or Mech units to defend. These Roaches should be able to scout and do some serious economic damage ? hopefully enough to end the game with constant reinforcements from the Nydus Network.

Transitions

This build is a 2 base all-in that gets a lot of attacking units and very few Drones as well as upgrades that do not lend themselves towards the mid or late game. Therefore, there is no well-defined follow-up for the build, should your attack fail. However, if you do a lot of damage with the attack but lose your Nydus Network, be sure to follow-up with a 3rd Hatchery, a lot more Drones, and 2 Evolution Chambers to try to transition into normal play.

Tips

- Against a Reaper/Hellion player, save your Queen energy after you start 2 or 3 Creep Tumors. Having energy for Transfuse lets you push back any early attacks without revealing your Roaches.
- Hide your Roaches for as long as possible before you move out. The less time you give your opponent to react to your build, the better your chance at crushing through their front.
- Make 2 Overlords per inject cycle ? 8 Roaches takes up 16 supply.
- Bring an Overseer or two with your Roach attack so that you have detection against Widow Mines. Remember to split your Roaches to avoid splash damage from either Widow Mines or Siege Tanks.
- This attack is an all-in, so you have to kill your opponent with this attack. Don?t let your Roaches mess around attacking buildings or SCVs ? kill your opponent?s army as soon as possible.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any player going for a fast 3 Command Center build (the current metagame) because of how late their upgrades and army will be. Also, any build that gets both Roach drops AND Nydus Networks is a very fun all-in to play with.
However, this is an all-in, so if you cannot do game-ending damage with the Roach attack, you will be economically behind the Terran opponent.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,MetabolicBoost,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Overlord,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Lair,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,RoachWarren,Drone,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,VentralSacs,Overlord,Overlord,GlialReconstitution,PneumatizedCarapace,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,NydusNetwork,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,NydusWorm', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:27 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Life Baneling Bust', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a quick 3 Hatcheries, faking as if you are going for a macro-oriented play, but then builds an overwhelmingly large swell of Zerglings and Baneling busts your opponent before they are ready.

Scouting

Use your initial 2 Zerglings to probe the front of your opponent?s natural. Assuming they don?t die, send them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or outside the front of the Terran?s base depending on the map.
Your next scout will be with your Baneling bust. Based off of how strong your opponent?s wall is, what unit composition he is using to defend, and how many SCVs you kill, react accordingly.

Transitions

While technically this build gets a third base, you are on a very low Drone count, and are spending all of your money on an early all-in that absolutely has to deal some amount of economic damage. Usually the only viable follow-up is sending wave after wave of Zerglings and Banelings in order to finish off your opponent, but if Terran has pushed you back or  over-committed to a strong wall-off, just pull back and Drone at home. Transition into standard Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk play if possible.

Tips

- While Life opens with a 15 Spawning Pool, you can perform this same build by opening with a 15 Hatchery as well.
- Hide your 2nd Extractor and Banelings Nest from areas where your opponent is likely to scout with a Reaper or Hellion.
- Morph your Banelings out of sight of your opponent?s wall-off, so your opponent does not know that you are about to hit him until your Baneling bust is already happening.
- Be sure to send your Banelings in to target down any Bunkers or Supply Depots in the wall first and then flood in with the rest of your Zerglings.
- Most of your initial army will likely die. The true win happens from your rallied army and any more Banelings you morph from it.

Pros and Cons

This build hits an early 2 Base timing when your opponent is less likely to be expecting any pressure, let alone a strong all-in. Without a strong wall-off or excellent micro, it will walk over most unsuspecting Terran players.
However, this build sacrifices a lot of economy and tech in order to fund such a huge army.

This build opens up with a quick 3 base economy to stay safe against any early Terran shenanigans as well as give you enough power to hit a strong Zergling/Baneling timing before your Terran opponent can get their 3 base economy rolling. One main strength of this build is that the timing push is not all-in, but rather a tool to get you safely to the familiar position of Mutalisks and 4 bases without having to deal with unrelenting Terran pressure.

Scouting

Note the 7:00 Overlord scout to check whether your opponent is going for Bio or Mech. Do not continue with this build order if your Overlord scout spots your opponent going for Mech.
If you scout a Reaper/Hellion/Banshee opener, keeping your Queens alive without Metabolic Boost is quite difficult. Instead of blindly rushing into this build, get a few Spine Crawlers and 1 Spore Crawler per mineral line with an extra Spore or two between the natural and 3rd Hatchery.  It is fine to commit a lot to defense in this situation as going Reaper/Hellion/Banshee slows down any Bio/Mine pushes considerably.
By the time you attack just after 11 minutes, you must know how Terran is going to defend. Run a Zergling or two at Terran?s wall where you want to bust through to spot what army composition is waiting.
- If you scout Bio/Mine, continue as normal with the initial bust.
- If you scout Marine/Tank, consider continuing the bust. However, if you see more than one Siege Tank, be sure to retreat and build your Spire/Creep/Hive!
- If you scout Mech this late, you have most likely already lost. Transitioning into Mutalisks or Swarm Hosts instantly may be enough to keep you alive, but know that you have committed a lot of resources to a bust that cannot succeed.

Transitions

Once you perform the bust, you will either outright win the game, do a little bit of economic damage and trade armies, or completely fail without doing any serious damage. In either of the first two cases, continue to deny the most recent Terran base (either an undefended 3rd, or a future 4th if their 3rd is well established), and continue to play the macro game. If your bust has completely failed, then you can attempt to play the macro game with your 5 Hatcheries already done, but note that you have committed and subsequently a lost of resources going into the macro game.
In a macro game, go up to Hive tech when you most prefer. Some Zergs delay it, some get it faster. Life is known for getting it for +3/+3 and faster Ultralisks. Eventually transitioning into Ultralisk/Queen/Infestor is a solid end-game unit composition ? just be sure that you have enough static defense to deny doom drops and stop Terran from spreading you too thin as you attempt to create this scary army.

Tips

- Against any early pressure, your Queens and a Spine Crawler are all the defense you will need.  With a later Metabolic Boost, you cannot rely on Speedlings to help defend any 1 base all-ins.
- Do your best to clear the map of any of your opponent?s Hellions BEFORE you are ready to bust. Being able to spawn your Banelings close to your opponent as opposed to back at your base makes this bust a lot more effective.
- Get an Overseer before the initial bust to help clear any Widow Mines. However, this build hits early enough that there should not be too many Widow Mines up just yet for you to worry about.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any player going for a Tank-less 3 Command Center build (the current metagame). Also, because you saturate your third base before moving out, it is quite easy to stop Zergling/Baneling production and transition into a macro game with a strong economic advantage.
However, this build sacrifices quick Mutalisks in lieu of more Zerglings and Banelings, so early drops can be a problem. Also, with such a heavy melee army, you have to be wary of Widow Mine detonations destroying your entire army.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Queen,InjectLarva,Queen,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Overlord,SpawnCreepTumor,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,MetabolicBoost,EvolutionChamber,EvolutionChamber,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Queen,SpawnCreepTumor,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,MeleeAttacksLevel1,GroundCarapaceLevel1,Overlord,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Lair,Hatchery,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,BanelingNest,Extractor,Extractor,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,SpawnCreepTumor,Hatchery,SpawnCreepTumor,CentrifugalHooks,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,MeleeAtacksLevel2,GroundCarapaceLevel2,InjectLarva,Overlord,Overlord,SpawnCreepTumor,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,SpawnCreepTumor,Overseer,Overseer,Overseer', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:28 PM;

This build opens with fast upgrades and mass Speedlings to crush any midgame attacks. It then transitions into a strong 3 base Ultralisk timing to either cripple the Protoss opponent or outright win the game.

Scouting

Scout first with your 2 initial Zerglings, use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of the Protoss base depending on the map.   Check to see whether your opponent is Gateway expanding or Forge expanding. Be wary of early pressure if your opponent is Gateway expanding.
With your 7:00 overlord scout, consider adding a Baneling Nest if you are up against a Gateway timing. Make mass Speedlings to defend any 2 base ground plays or ramp up Queen production early to defend any 2 base air plays.
Against a 2 base Colossus push, consider adding a Spire for Corruptors if you need more defense. Also, regardless of whether or not you need to make Corruptors for defense, you should start Air upgrades in case of a Mutalisk switch after you have maxed out with your Ultralisk army.
Ideally, your Ultras should be out with +5/+3 around 15:50. Commit to an attack as soon as possible when these upgrades finish.  If you have yet to take a 4th base and Spire or Hydralisk Den by this stage in the game, get them now.

Transitions

There is no ?transition? per se.  If you can win the game with this push, then be sure to attack in an open position and take the game quickly. If you cannot win the game outright, then fall back on your 4 base economy and tech switch to whatever best counters your opponent?s army.

Tips

Against Pylon blocks

- If you want to try and guarantee the Hatchery being placed, send a Drone to your natural around 11/12 supply and hide it there. This might trick Protoss into thinking that you are going Pool first.  Note that this will not work every time, and it also will not stop a Protoss dedicated to Pylon blocking you.
- A 15 Pool/15 Hatch/15 Gas opener (or at worst ? if they fail to cancel the Pylon ? a 15 Pool/15 Gas/and Hatchery as soon as you can) will be fine in this case. The most important thing is starting your Extractor on time, not the natural Hatchery.
- Be sure to make 4-6 Zerglings to take the pylon down if you need to, and go up to 3 Queens as soon as you can ? just like normal.
- Once you place your Extractor, the first 100 gas goes to Metabolic Boost, and place your Evolution Chambers when you get to 175 gas like normal to transition back into the build.

The Engagement

- Bring your Queens to transfuse, and any optional Infestors or Banelings you made to force good engagements.
- Do NOT engage into a Protoss wall. You want to engage in as open an area as you possibly can for your melee army to do maximum damage.
- Do NOT engage without your queens in transfuse range unless you are sure you can take a strong fight. Strong creep spread with all of your Queens helps tremendously.
- Try to avoid Archons with your Zerglings; use the Ultralisks to tank those. Similarly, focus your Zerglings on Stalkers and Immortals; keep your Ultralisks away from those.
- If you use Ultralisks to crush any forcefields, Zerglings can actually deal with Colossi quite easily as they take minimal damage whilst underneath the Colossi.

Pros and Cons

This build is very strong against a ?standard? Protoss army of Gateway units, Colossi and some Stargate or Templar units. Also, this timing attack has the strong potential to end the game.
However, this build is somewhat simple for Protoss to scout and is vulnerable to timing attacks and all-ins when you only have upgraded Speedlings to defend. Also, if your Protoss opponent is positioned in a well defended location, the engage can be quite difficult to perform well.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Extractor,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Zergling,MetabolicBoost,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Queen,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,EvolutionChamber,EvolutionChamber,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,MeleeAttacksLevel1,GroundCarapaceLevel1,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,Lair,Overlord,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Overlord,Queen,InjectLarva,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,Extractor,Extractor,Queen,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Queen,Hatchery,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,MeleeAtacksLevel2,GroundCarapaceLevel2,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,Overlord,InfestationPit,SpawnCreepTumor,Queen,Queen,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Queen,Queen,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Hive,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Queen,Queen,Overlord,Overlord,Extractor,Extractor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Infestor,Infestor,Infestor,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,AdrenalineGlands,UltraliskCavern,MeleeAttacksLevel3,GroundCarapaceLevel3,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Hatchery,ChitinousPlating,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:28 PM;

This is still the super standard and passive blink stylethat gets only 2 gates instead of 3 early and a slightly earlier robo.Only chronos blink ONCE so that you can focus the rest of probes to get eco going for the 2 base play as early as possible.

This blink is by no means meant to be used aggressively. It is simply adefensive blink opener that can react to many different things and just be an overall safe opener. (You might want to go up to 3 gates if you scout them going factory after 1 rax FE in case they go for a marine/hellion drop so that you can be sure you have enough stalkers out) 

From there you get a robo bay for early colossus andspend all chronoboosts into that roboto get them out as quickly as possible. You also fit in some cannons to help defend vs drops. Even if he doesn't open widow mines, you can still afford them in the build so I don't see any downside to getting them no matter what for the extra defense. 

After that you simplyget 4 more gates to go up to a total of 7and then make only stalkers and colossus and brute force your way in with +1 attack behind you.

Why this late of an attack works

So basically this buildpretends to be a really safe and passive opener. It looks like a passive blink/colossus opener that just defends and takes a slow third to stay extra safe. By the time a terran would be scouting and realizing that you aren't actually taking a third, the attack is going to be knocking at his door. It's simply a very oddly timed attack, but it hits at such a crucial point. This is basically when the terran's third should be getting saturated and his first wave of attempted aggression will have been deflected.You're hitting him in his transitional period between his 2 base set up and his 3 base set up: getting a few more barracks with add ons and his attempted switch into vikings. This is when the terran wants to sit for just a minute before being able to go for more rounds of aggression. If you trade very well earlier on when he tries to do some drops, then that just makes this timing even wider because he will have to keep making medivacs instead of vikings and will just in general have less units.

The reason why there's no zealots or sentries is because the build is focusing so much on anti drop defense early on. It's also an extremely brute force all in. It's meant to really jump into the terrans face and have high chasing power vs retreating medivacs and also to be able todrop vikings instantly. If you can keep the vikings from killing the colossus then they will do an absurd amount of damage with that early of a +1 attack. Thelarge quantity of blink stalkersalso makes it so thatevery unit you have is microable and savable. This isn't like most colossus all ins where it's just straight to colossus as early as possible.

This build is a fast expand build that opens with a Mothership Core for defense, and then follows-up with a very quick 5gate timing with Zealots and Sentries to crush your opponent before they can even enter their midgame tech.

Scouting

After the early game, scouting is much more minimal than you might expect. As long as you can confirm your opponent is getting a third Hatchery (and sometimes even if they are not getting one), you should be able to go through with this build.

With your attack, you will be able to scout what units he is using to defend. If you are fighting mass Speedling, then constantly warp-in Zealots and Sentries.  If you are fighting Roaches, then constantly warp-in Stalkers. Your opponent should not be able to get out either Hydras or Mutalisks in time to defend this attack.

Transitions

If it appears that your opponent has way over-committed to defending your attack with units or Spine Crawlers, you can always retreat and go for the macro game. Either force field your opponent back and walk home or mass recall your army to your natural Nexus. A common follow-up to this build is starting a Robotics Facility and going for Colossi to deal with your opponent s Roaches. Alternatively, you can go for a Stargate and make Phoenix in order to prepare for your opponent s Mutalisks. Be sure to use Hallucinations often to check-up on what midgame tech your opponent is going for. Take a third base when you feel safe.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a Gateway expand, so your 5gate attack will hit very soon (before 7 minutes). This build usually hits your opponent before they have any midgame tech.

However, this build relies on you deflecting your opponent s scouting information in order for it to be maximally effective.

This CC First build takes your economy immediately into the midgame and then transitions into a 9 minute, 2 base Marine/Hellion/Medivac timing with Stimpack.

Scouting

Build the Command Center on the high ground and then wall-off with your initial Barracks. This way, you will not have to worry about early Zerglings because you will have a full wall. Thus, SCV scouting is no longer necessary.

Your first scouting comes from the first Hellions you make. With these Reactor Hellions, you can take map control, clears out any Zerglings at watchtowers, and pokes Zergs front to spot the Zergs third base, any buildings at the front, and any units that Zerg is making.

If you see a ton of Speedlings, then make sure your Hellion micro is on point. Feel free to pull back behind your natural wall in order to more effectively deal with Speedlings.

If you see Roaches, then immediately cut Reactor Hellion production and start making Widow Mines two at a time. Delay your Starport for a little while in order to afford Marauders, and consider cutting SCVs in order to complete a wall-off at your natural and prevent your opponent from running past your Bunker/Widow Mines.

If you see two Evolution Chambers, then assume your opponent is playing a macro game.

Alternatively, if you see a third base, then you can also assume your opponent is playing a macro game.

Transitions

This build transitions pretty normally into standard Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine play as well as Marine/Tank/Medivac play in a pretty common manner. However, because of the resources and time you have devoted to Bio units and upgrades, this build cannot transition into Mech.

For either the Bio/Mine or Marine/Tank transition, as you are pushing out, instantly start your 3rd Command Center, Combat Shields, and 2 Engineering Bays. It is also strongly suggested that you continue Medivac and Marine production before adding on more Barracks so that you can continue unrelenting drop play and keep your opponent on their half of the map while you are attempting to take your own third and get into your comfortable late-game infrastructure. When your Engineering Bays finish, be sure to start your Infantry upgrades, all of your Refineries, and throw down up to 5 more Barracks to be able to pump out your 3 base army.

If you are going for Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine play, be sure to start a Reactor on your naked Factory and start Widow Mine production (adding a 2nd Factory with a Tech lab for the Widow Mine upgrade once you have later secured your third).

If you are going for a Marine/Tank/Medivac play, be sure to start a Tech lab on your naked Factory and start Siege Tank production (adding a 2nd Factory with a Tech lab once you have later secured your third).

Tips

- Do NOT over commit with your initial Hellions. Use them exclusively for scouting purposes in the early game; their true purpose is to bolster your ground army in the actual Marine/Hellion/Medivac timing attack.
- Against any all-ins with this build, you must rely on your Bunker placement, SCV control, and scouting it coming. Be active on the map with your first Hellions so that you know what is coming your way before it gets to your doorstep.
- Feel free to push out with your Bio army even before Stimpack/Medivacs are even done. As long as you have Hellions scouting in front to ensure you are not being all-inned, your Bio army can be walking across the map while your Medivacs boost in behind them so that you hit your opponent the second Stimpack finishes.
- Do NOT clump up against Banelings. Your opponent should not be able to have that many Banelings by the 9 minute attack, but be sure to spread your army and micro appropriately if you see Banelings on the field.
- Remember to pick up your Marines into the Medivacs and boost away as soon as your army is finally overtaken. Keeping your opponent on their side of the map while you set up your own third base is crucial.
- Save at least one scan to kill creep. As a Zerg, losing your initial midgame creep and a Queen or two spreading it can be devastating for the later stages of the game.

Pros and Cons

This build opens quite economically, and then transitions into making a strong army and hitting your opponent with a lot of units at the 9 minute mark before they can even stabilize their third base economy. It is a very strong build for punishing greedy Zergs.

However, while it is a CC First opener that is not at all all-in, it is definitely not nearly as macro-oriented as the standard Reactor Hellion 3CC build or other 3CC builds such as Polts Map Control Build. Also, if your opponent can see it coming and overproduces units to defend, you will have to pick up and rely on drop play instead of a large frontal assault to get an advantage.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Bunker,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SCV,CallMule,Factory,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,SCV,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Refinery,TechLabOnBarracks,CallMule,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,StimPack,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marauder,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Starport,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleHellions,SCV,Marauder,SCV,CallMule,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,Marauder,DoubleMedivacs,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnFactory,Marauder,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:28 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Maru Reaper FE to Hellbat-Banshee Push', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE transitions into a fast 2 base Hellbat Banshee timing in order to crush your opponent early regardless of whether or not they open with Roaches.

Scouting

Use your Reaper to poke around your opponents natural and ascertain whether or not they are performing an early all-in. Later, when you have Hellions out, poke the front to ensure that your opponent is taking a 3rd base and not performing some delayed 2 base all-in. Favor keeping your Hellions alive over getting more scouting information/killing Drones because you will need every Hellion later for the Hellbat Banshee timing.

During your actual attack, be sure to note whether your opponent is defending with Roaches (which means a potential Roach/Hydra midgame, or at the very least delayed Mutalisks) or with Ling/Bane (which means a probable Ling/Bane/Muta midgame, and a more standard Mutalisk timing).

Transitions

This build opens with a 1/1/1 and therefore does not yet commit to a Bio or Mech midgame. It can in fact transition into either quite easily.

For a Bio (+Hellbat or Widow Mine) transition, start your 3rd Command Center as you swap off your Barracks onto the Starports Tech lab in order to start Stimpack research, 2 Engineering Bays, and 4 more Barracks. Use non-Stimpack Medivac drops to delay your opponent while you get up the necessary midgame infrastructure.

For a Mech transition, start your 3rd Command Center, 2 Factories, and 2 more Refineries. Continue Banshee production to deal with a Roach counter-attack as well as take advantage of the delayed Mutalisk tech.

Tips

- Use your initial Marine to try and pick off an early scouting Overlord as well as deny early Drone scouts.
- Your Reaper is not meant to deal damage, but rather give you some basic scouting and map control.
- Do NOT over-commit your Hellions while scouting around your opponents base; you will need all of them for the followup Hellbat Banshee timing to be effective.
- Try and position a Marine or two inside your base to shoot down any scouting Overlords.
- During the actual Hellbat Banshee attack, be sure to stutter step into Roaches and Queens, and spread/kite Zerglings and Banelings.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong 2 base all-in that can outright kill an unsuspecting Zerg opponent, and at the very least forces a huge response in order to defend. By forcing your opponent to make an army, you keep both of your economies low and extend the midgame (where Terran is arguably best in TvZ). Also, this build is better than an exclusively Hellbat attack because of Banshees effectiveness against Roaches.

However this attack requires a lot of micro in order to keep up with a rally of Hellions and Banshees. Also, it is a 2 base build, so has a much smaller economy than standard macro play.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Reaper,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,Factory,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,LiftRaxFromReactor,ReactorOnBarracks,CallMule,SCV,Starport,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SCV,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,DoubleHellions,Refinery,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnStarport,SCV,SCV,CallMule,CallMule,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleHellions,SCV,SCV,CloakingField,Banshee,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Armory,SCV,SCV,DoubleHellions,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,Banshee,CallMule,DoubleHellions', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:28 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'NaNiwa Zealot-Immortal All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Gateway Expand and then transitions into a very quick all-in with 2 Immortals, a Warp Prism, and a lot of +1 Zealots.

Scouting

After the early game, scouting is much more minimal than you might expect. As long as you can confirm your opponent is getting a third Hatchery, you should be able to go through with this build.

However, if your opponent scouts your Robotics Facility early on, then you can send your Warp Prism directly towards your opponent s base in order to both fake pressure and see what units/buildings they have made.  This Warp Prism poke provides a bit of scouting that may help you deduce what unit composition your opponent will try to defend your all-in with.

Transitions

This build is a 2base all-in, so there is no standard way to follow-up this build should the attack not outright win the game. If your opponent holds off your all-in without taking too much damage, then you will most likely lose the game soon after. That being said, starting more Assimilators and teching to either Colossi or Blink Stalkers (depending on what unit composition your opponent used to defend your all-in) for a second desperation all-in might just be enough to win the game.

Tips

- The limiting factor in this build is the Robotics Facility time. Be sure to chronoboost your Robotics Facility to get out the Warp Prism and Immortals in time for such a fast attack.
- Send your Warp Prism to your opponent s base as soon as it completes for both fake pressure and potential scouting information.
- When you move out for the attack, be sure to fully wall-off your natural expansion (and even potentially build some cannons) to stop your opponent from running around your army and going for a base trade.
- The most important part of the army are your Robotics units. Keep your Zealots all in front of your Immortals/Warp Prism so that they tank all (or most) incoming damage. Using the Warp Prism, pick up Immortals that are being targeted down to move them further back behind your Zealot meat shield. If your Warp Prism is being targeted down, bring it out of the fight and retreat a bit before warping in more Zealots.
- If your opponent is trying to defend with Roaches or Mutalisks and you have a little extra gas, then mix in some Stalkers into the mix for some extra DPS.

Pros and Cons

This is a strong all-in that hits before your opponent can have much tech out in order to end the game quickly. With +1 Zealots dealing lots of damage to Zerglings, and Immortals shredding up Roaches, this build walks through most Zerg defenses with ease.

However, none of your units are anti-air. Thus, if your opponent gets out Mutalisks before your attack has dealt lots of damage, then you will be in a lot of trouble. Also, losing a single Immortal or the Warp Prism due to poor micro can almost instantly lose you the game.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Nexus,MothershipCore,WarpgateUpgrade,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Probe,Forge,Gateway,Probe,Zealot,Probe,Probe,WarpPrism,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Immortal,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Immortal,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,Pylon,Observer,Chronoboost,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:29 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'MKP 1-1-1 All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This is a highly aggressive, 1 base 1/1/1 all-in which focuses on early harass to damage your opponent while simultaneously building up army for a follow-up all-in. While this build has the potential to fall back into a macro game, transitioning into the midgame is difficult if early damage is not inflicted on the opponent.

Scouting

This build gives you several opportunities for scouting. Your first bit of information comes from getting your scouting SCV into his base between 12 and 16 food. If you manage to get your SCV into your opponents base, check for how many Refineries your opponent has. If your opponent does not have gas, they will most likely be doing a 1rax FE build. This presents one of the better scenarios for your early game Hellion drop to workespecially if your opponent does not anticipate the Hellion drop. If your opponent has one Refinery, it likely means that your opponent will be going for Reapers, have a Marine/Hellion defense, or have a Marine/Widow Mine defense. With your Hellions drop, do not over commit, simply keep your opponent busy. If your opponent attempts to Hellion expand, he will pull ahead economically assuming his defense prevents your hellions from inflicting any damage. You will most likely not see a second gas geyser with your SCV scout.

Once you have your first Hellions out, you should have full map control by clearing any XelNaga Towers and poking the front. Running in to spot your opponents natural is also a smart move, but be sure to pull back if there are any units defending. Your Hellions are there to increase the effectiveness of your later all-in, not to end the game early on.

Lastly, when you Hellion drop in his main, you should finally be able to see everything your opponent has gone for. If your opponent has gone for Cloaked Banshees, it will not instantly be a threat because he will need to keep the Banshee in his base to defend his workers. Later, once you have a Raven, Banshees will no longer be an issue. If your opponent has gone for Hellions of his own, be careful when out on the map, and always favor retreating if your Hellions are in danger. If your opponent has gone for Widow Mines, be sure to avoid obvious spots where he could have placed them.

Ideal Game

Your Hellion drop should inflict some kind of damage to your opponent and keep him occupied with defensive measures. However, even while doing damage with them, it is important to keep them alive. With ideal Hellion harass, your later all-in will overwhelm your opponent or trade in your favor.

If your opponent is prepared for the all-in engagement, he will most likely have either a Bunker, Siege Tanks, or both to defend. Your Hellions from earlier can help clear SCVs repairing the Bunker. Assuming you need to siege and push slowly because he has Tanks, consider dropping your Hellions again to divert some forces and his attention. However, remember that every unit is precious, so do not over commit with this drop.

Transitioning

In the situation where you cannot straight up win the game with your all-in but still have him contained, consider expanding and transitioning into Marine/Tank play or Mech. Simply throw down an expansion, take more gas, and ramp up your production from there.

If the all-in fails and your opponent is ahead economically, then you will have most likely lost the game. However, expanding and defending this base with Siege Tanks can still be a last-ditch option.

Tips

- With your first two Hellions, clear the XelNaga Watchtowers and take map control.
- During your Hellion drop, be sure to constantly pump Marines from your Reactored Barracks and produce Siege Tanks.  The strength of this build is the follow-up all-in, not the initial Hellion drop.
- Do NOT lose your Hellions when dropping them.  Use the Medivac boost to get your Hellions out of there if they are ever in danger.
- When moving out, be sure to bring 2 SCVs to repair.
- Slowly siege your opponent unless you are sure you can crush through the front.
- Remember to use Seeker Missile or Auto Turrets from your Raven to push the fight in your favor.

Pros and Cons

This build is a 1-2 punch of sortsfirst hitting with a Hellion drop and then following up with a Marine/Tank all-in. It is often too much for expanding opponents to handle and quickly ends the game. The Hellion drop can also be deadly harass if your opponent does not scout it or defend appropriately.

However, because this build was created by MarineKing himself, it is quite micro intensive, and thus is hard to pull off as a lower league player.

This build opens with a 1gate FE and then transitions into a strong timing attack with +2/+2 Chargelots and Archons.

Benchmark: When you start Charge (@8:10ish), you should have 1 Mothership Core, 1 Stalker, 3 Sentries, and 45 Probes.

Push out when your 3rd Archon finishes (@11:00ish) with 3 Sentries, 3 Archons, 1 Stalker, and around 12 Zealots, with +2/+2 about to finish.

Scouting

In the early game, Probe scout after your Gateway in order to spot whether your opponent is opening with a Reaper or Widow Mine drop. Against Reaper play you have to position your initial few units very defensively in order to avoid losing any Probes. Against a Widow Mine drop, be sure to build those Photon Cannons in your mineral lines as soon as your Forges finish. After the early game, scouting is much more minimal than you might expect. As long as you can confirm your opponent is not 1 base all-inning you (Hallucinations can give you a lot of information), you can perform this build.

Transitions

This build is a strong two base timing attack, so be sure to commit all your energy into non-stop warping in from a proxy Pylon in order to bust through your opponent?s front. In most situations, you will simply be able to walk through your opponent?s front and win the game.

However, if your opponent has a strong defense at his natural (Supply Depots and multiple Bunkers), you do already have plenty of Probes back at home, so you can simply start a 3rd Nexus, resume Probe Production, continue upgrades by getting +3/+3, and transition into Storm play. If you are going for this macro play, then be sure to get out several Colossus before you max out for a stronger 200 supply army.

Tips

- You are only able to afford so many units because of how many Probes you have. Be sure to Chronoboost your Nexii as often as possible in the early game to get up a strong 2 base economy.
- The limiting factor in this build is the Forge upgrades.  After the early game, Chronoboost your Forges as often as you can so that your 11 minute attack hits with +2/+2.
- Hallucinate Phoenix to get scouting information on your opponent?s opening build order.
- Against Reaper play, position your initial units defensively.
- Against Widow Mine play, be sure to get out those Photon Cannons in each mineral line on time. Using your Photon Overcharge and target firing an early Medivac can be a game changer in defending early pressure.
- Set up multiple proxy Pylons before you are ready to move out so that even if your opponent kills one or two of them, you will be able to reinforce your attack.
- During the attack, be sure that your army does not waste time attacking buildings.  Focus fire and reposition your army so that everything is always fighting your opponent?s army.
- If your opponent has a solid wall at his natural, then do not commit to a doomed attack. Simply playing the macro game with your upgrade advantage is a much stronger option.

Pros and Cons

This is a strong attack that destroys Bio players who do not have good building placement or who are playing too greedy. Also, your strong attack has +2/+2 and 60 Probes ? so even if it fails, you have a strong economy and upgrade lead going into the late game.

This build is not great against early Widow Mine drops because your only detection is the Photon Cannons in your mineral lines.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker back to the protection of your Sentries/Force fields and warp-in units quickly if you have to defend an early attack.

The majority of your scouting comes from your Hallucinated Phoenix. Your phoenix should be able to get into your opponent?s main base and determine what tech route you see your opponent going.

- If your opponent is expanding quickly, then feel safe. Consider going for a midgame Immortal+Gateway bust.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then be sure that you do not fall behind in the Immortal/Colossus count going into the midgame. Do NOT over produce Stalkers.
- If your opponent has a Stargate, then be sure to not take damage against early Phoenix or Oracles. Produce several Stalkers to initially protect your mineral lines, but consider getting a Stargate of your own or going for a quick Blink timing in order to truly stay safe against your opponent. Keep a tabs on when they take their natural expansion ? a 3gate Stargate attack can be deadly if you are skipping too many warp-ins or teching too aggressively.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then make one Observer for detection against DTs and constantly produce Immortals. Also be sure to position your army/Mothership Core defensively in order to safely defend any Blink attacks.

Transitions

This build is a very strong macro opener that transitions into a macro game quite easily. However, the actual unit composition of that macro game very often depends completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with. If your opponent stays on one base for too long, then throw down more Gateways, constantly make units, and prepare to defend your natural with Stalkers, Immortals, and your Planetary Nexus. In Robotics vs Stargate macro games, quickly switch into Blink or Stargate play of your own so as to not lose against any Void Ray based armies. In Robotics vs Robotics macro games, Immortal count and/or Colossus count are the most important things.  Keep tabs on your opponent?s tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Robotics vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponent?s potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by producing Immortals+Gateway units or Colossus for defense.

Tips

- Use all your initial chronoboost on Probes so as to establish your economic advantage going into the midgame.
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial Stalker to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap?s 3gate All-in).
- Against all 1 base attacks, you must defend using your Planetary Nexus. To maximize your protection, save your Mothership Core energy as long as possible ? only calling in your Planetary Nexus once your opponent has committed to attacks. Be sure to constantly chronoboost Immortals out for maximum DPS against ground-based armies.
- Against Blink play, be sure to position some of your army and an Immortal or two in your main base to destroy any Stalkers that blink up outside the range of your Planetary Nexus.
- Against Stargate play, be sure to warp-in some initial Stalkers and position your units to defend both mineral lines from potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very versatile, macro build that takes advantage of the power and range of your Planetary Nexus in order to stay safe against early attacks. It also gets detection and Immortals for defense, so very often you have a more stable opening than most other PvP builds.

However, defending early Stargate play can be quite tricky as your Robotics Facility does not help at all in producing anti-air units. Also, this build requires a lot of scouting information to be executed effectively, so getting a Hallucination into your opponent?s base is crucial.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Probe,MothershipCore,Sentry,Nexus,Gateway,Sentry,Pylon,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Immortal,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:29 PM;

While this did get slightly nerfed with the new patch, so far it is still definitely possible to pull them off, however you just have to be a little bit careful.

The scout allows you to see exactly what tech you're going against since blink can be a little bit risky at times. Here's a general idea of what you can do vs some particular openings with this build:

Vs. Robo expands: So robo expands are tough builds to crack with blink openers. You really need to stretch them thin with blink and get a little fancy with warping in a sentry and force them into the main and forcefield them in to snipe the natural or visa versa etc. But you normally can't straight win vs robo expands an you'll just need to expand and probe behind it. For a little more in expanding out of blink openers in PvP check outDay9's daily #674.

Vs. Stargate openers: So generally this is where this build shines the most. You should be able to get in their while their unit count is low and screw them up. There isn't too much to say here except to remember about the potential oracle swinging in the back and ruining your day, as well as to not be too overeager with void ray #yolo blinks as you can find yourself losing quite quickly. Just be patient and mass a good stalker count and hit when you know it's right.

Vs. DTs: This is where the MSCore scout comes into play the most. When going vs DT's you're going to need to drop a robo ASAP (before or after blink depending on how quickly they made the dark shrine) and you're going to have to macro out of it. It's very difficult to break a DT opener with blink as you have to wait for multiple observers to know you're safe. Just poke and prod a bit and see what damage you can do while expanding yourself.

Vs. Blink: This is all up to micro. You have to simple be VERY careful about analyzing your stalker count in comparison to his before engaging and to micro your god damn heart out. Blink vs blink doesn't happen too often, but when it does it's literally about who has more stalkers, so you need to be extra crisp when this happens. If you can find any small advantages like a few hits on a stalkers hull in the initial mid map skirmishes it will only help you.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Gateway,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Pylon,Probe,TwilightCouncil,Probe,Stalker,Stalker,Gateway,Blink,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Gateway,Probe', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:29 PM;

However the spin is that he gets 2 extra stargates after the 3rd goes down and continues making phoenix.

Once you get your 3rd up you'll have to be active in scouting with your phoenix to see what you should do to follow up. If you scout aheavy roach reactionto your 3rd, then you should instantly start chronoing void rays out of your 3 stargates. You can start getting immortals as well from the robo if you really think you can't hold.

If he goes for ahydra ling bust, then you need to continuously chrono phoenix. You don't try to get colossus up ASAP, that will just end in tears. Mass phoenix is EXTREMELY good vs lowish numbers of hydras. And when you are making as many as you are in this build, then that can extrapolate to medium numbers of hydras as well. Make sure you engage in smaller areas like ramps or in chokes if possible so you can abuse forcefields and timewarp/overcharge and lift all dem hydras up and laff at how their "anti-air" can't even kill air.

If you notice them beingvery greedy, with a fast 4th base and hardly any units, you can try to do a little timing with zealot/sentry and about 10-11 phoenix.

This build opens with a Nexus First and only enough units to secure a ridiculously fast 3rd base. With a 3 base economy, it then hits a 9 minute 7 gate attack comprised of mainly Stalkers and Sentries.

Scouting

This build opens incredibly greedily, so be sure that your opponent is expanding and droning with an initial Probe scout. Besides any initial Probe(s), however, this build does not give you any tools with which to scout your opponent. The majority of your scouting will come with the actual attack at 9 minutes.

Transitions

This build can either all-in or transition comfortably into a macro game.

If you are choosing to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly warp-in and chronoboost your Gateways, set up several proxy Pylons around your opponent?s third base, and stop all Probe production.

If you are choosing to play the macro game, then only use the attack to hopefully deal a bit of damage while you continue producing Probes and teching at home. Getting a Twilight Council, all of your gasses, and going for a +2 Blink Stalker army is a good choice.  Alternatively, you can start a Robotics Facility, all of your gasses, and go straight for Colossi.

Tips

- Spend all of your early game chronoboost on your two Nexus to maximize Probe production.
- Keep your Mothership Core out in front of your natural to help ward off any scouting Zerglings.
- Until you are ready to attack, position your Sentries and Zealot very defensively. Staying against buildings or walls will increase the effectiveness of defensive force fields dramatically.
- Use 2 of your Gateways to wall-in a Photon Cannon while your third base is being set up. A Cannon that cannot be targeted by Zerglings is incredibly effective at stopping runbys.
- Be sure to start moving out before +1 actually finishes in order to hit your opponent as early as possible.
- Constantly warp-in Stalkers with the attack, using your initial 8 Sentries to keep back enemy Roach/Ling armies.
- Don?t forget to mass recall your army back home if you end up getting surrounded.

Pros and Cons

This build is an incredibly greedy build that initially powers economy hard and then transitions into a powerful 7 Gate attack. You have both a strong army and a strong economy.

However, this build does not get much tech before the attack.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'MC Oracle Expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This PvT opener opens with early Oracles to smash through un-upgraded marines and harass your opponent?s mineral line, all while taking an expansion back at home and transitioning into the midgame.

Scouting

This build opens aggressively with lots of units, so there is no need to be worried about early pressure. However, in order for you to control your Oracles well and attack in the correct places, it is necessary to know what your opponent is building. Thus, use your early game map control with your Stalkers and Mothership Core to poke in and see whether your opponent is going for Widow Mines/where they are building Turrets/how they have positioned their Marines so that you will know when and how to attack with your oracles.

Transitions

This build transitions into any normal midgame that you would like. At around the 8 minute mark, plant down either a Robotics Facility or Twilight Council to start your teching into Colossus or High Templars+Storm. Then, after your Oracle harass has finished, you will already be halfway to your desired tech. Getting more gateways down and the upgrades (+1 Ground Armor and Charge/Storm) started while you are harassing your opponent is very important.

Alternatively, you can go for a Phoenix/Colossus midgame army. Plant down a Robotics Facility at around the 8 minute mark and tech straight for Colossi on 4 Assimilators. When your Robotics Bay finishes, start 2 more Gateways, start your first Colossus, and begin producing Phoenix in order to re-converge to a play style akin to Jim?s Phoenix/Colossus Build.

Tips

- Use your first Stalker to deny an SCV/Reaper scout and keep your opponent in the dark as to what build you are going.
- Rally your Oracles to an airspace near your opponent?s base so that your push happens as soon as you are ready.
- The Mothership Core can poke in and around your opponent?s main base to see what tech buildings they have and/or what units they are building.
- Go in with your first Oracle if they opened with gas to start applying pressure soon. If you wait for 3 or 4 Oracles, a Widow Mine drop might be already on the way and you would not be able to defend it.
- Wait for more Oracles if they opened gasless 1rax FE and your stalkers have not been able to do any damage. If you go in too soon, then they?ll just build a reactive missile turret and shut down your later Oracles.
- Remember: Oracles scale REALLY well. 3 Oracles can take down up to 10 marines without losing a single Oracle.  Be aggressive vs marines, and super defensive vs turrets/widow mines.
- Do not forget to include the Mothership Core in the fight ? its DPS and Time Warp spell are very useful when taking out marines/units.
- Start that midgame transition BEFORE you focus on the harass in your opponent?s base so that after the Oracle harass has finished, you will already be halfway to your desired midgame tech.

Pros and Cons

This build gives you map control and hits your opponents with a lot of early game Oracles to destroy a mineral line. It is strong because Oracles absolutely destroy un-upgraded marines, and are maneuverable enough that they can track down and run after SCVs.

However, opening with this build delays your expand a lot more than if you had opened straight 1gate FE. Because you have less economy, the midgame Terran timing attacks with medivacs are even scarier than normal (unless you do damage with your Oracles), so you actually have to do damage to attempt to transition into the midgame. Remember that Oracles have very little health, so you have to babysit your units if you have any hope of not losing them instantly to a well placed Missile Turret/Widow Mine.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,MothershipCore,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Stargate,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Oracle,Probe,Nexus,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Chronoboost,Oracle,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Oracle,Probe,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:29 PM;

Because this build opens with as many different map control units as Terran has, there is no need for super early SCV scouting. Your initial scout comes from your Reaper(s) poking into your opponents base. Check for a lack of a natural, early gas, or any quick tech buildings. Consider cutting Hellions and getting Widow Mines instead if your opponent is going for a very early all-in.

The next scout comes from your Reapers and Hellions poking the front.  You should be able to spot a 3rd base and your opponents Queen count.  If you see a lack of Queens and no 3rd base, then be prepared for a 2 base all-in of sorts. Extra bunkers, a full wall-off, and Marauders/Siege Tanks are the best ways to defend most Roach or Baneling based all-ins.

Finally, your last scout comes from a Medivac drop and your Viking. Use your Viking to kill Overlords blocking your 3rd base or scouting around the map. You can also use the Viking to keep tabs on your opponents base count up until they have any anti-air (usually Mutalisks). Be sure not to lose the Viking to Queens, however, so stay off creep. Also, use your Medivac drop for map control at the front. Scan, kill creep, and pick up and leave with your 8 units up everywhere your opponent is spreading creep until your opponent has Mutalisks.

This build gets you map control in every way: initial ground control comes from your Reapers; follow-up ground control comes from your Reaper/Hellion pokes; follow-up air control comes from your Viking on Overlord-killing duty; and follow-up creep control comes from a squadron of Marine/Marauder in your Medivac. Be sure to use all of these to their fullest in order to have maximum scouting information.

Transitions

This build transitions well into both Marine/Tank or Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine. It can also transition into Mech, but anyone who watches Polt as a player knows that he never goes Mech in basically any matchup, so I have opted not to write-up the Mech transition.

For either transition, start Stimpack research and 2 Engineering Bays so that your midgame army will have some staying power on the field. Once you have minerals, throw down up to 7 Barracks and an extra Factory to reach the 3 base infrastructure that you need to out-produce your Zerg opponent. Start producing Siege Tanks or Widow Mines from your initial Factory to get a healthy unit count while you are building up your Bio army.

Lift up your third base and take your third once you feel safe, starting an Armory so as to continue your upgrades. Remember to stay on top of your huge mineral count. Because this build only stays on 3 buildings for unit production for quite some time, but gets you a similar income, your mineral income will seem much larger than you think. Start those Engineering Bays and Barracks as soon as you can afford them for a strong midgame army.

Tips

- Do NOT over commit your initial Reapers by trying to kill Drones. Use them more for scouting and prioritize keeping them alive so as to keep your opponents early game units back at home.
- Do NOT over commit your initial Reaper/Hellion poke by trying to kill Drones. Again, use them more for scouting and prioritize keeping them alive unless you see a huge opening that you can punish (such as spotting your opponents Queens off creep and knowing that your opponent does not have Zergling Speed).
- If you spot your opponent going all-in, then be sure to stop map-control-unit production and instantly begin Widow Mines and Marauders. Adding an extra Bunker and/or completing your wall-off at your natural will help provide buffers against any incoming attacks as well.
- When your Viking pops, be sure to shoot down as many Overlords as you can. Simply shift-queue up an attack route around all of your side of the map in order to kill any Overlords your opponent has that are off creep.
Use your initial Medivac and several Marines/Marauders for creep-killing duty. Scan, kill creep, and pick up and leave with your 8 units up everywhere your opponent is spreading creep until your opponent has Mutalisks. Try and pick off a Queen if you can.
- Once you throw down your 3rd Command Center, you are going to have A LOT of minerals. Be sure to transition quickly by starting the Engineering Bays, Barracks, and Refineries as soon as you can afford them.

Pros and Cons

This build is quite strong because of its ability to scout and harass early on.  With Reapers, Hellions, Vikings, and Medivacs all being used to take map control, and a 1/1/1 at home with the versatility to react to whatever units your opponent seems to be making, this build is also quite safe against any early all-ins that your opponent might try to do. Finally, if your opponent ever slips up and does not adequately prepare for your continuous production of map control units, you can quickly kill many Drones and take a huge economic advantage as what happens in game 5 of Polt vs HyuN.

It also requires a lot of APM in order to micromanage all of your early game harassing/map control units while keeping up your macro at home.

If you don't want to play that greedy you can still do a similar version of the build off of a FFE, it'll just hit a tad later and you may want to just adapt it to be not as all in.

The build itself is quite simple. You get a fast nexus, go into 1 gate for sentry production to stay safe/build up energy, expand, make more gates, and then attack with mass sentry/stalker at an awkward time for the zerg to deal with. There isn't TOO much to explain with this one as it all comes down to execution.

There are a few reasons behind getting the fast 3rd even if you aren't actually transferring probes to it.

1) It fakes the zerg out. When they see that early of a Nexus they're going to do one of two things. They will either make mass units to try and kill it (which is fine since you're going to have 7 gates worth of production and a bunch of sentries) or they go heavy econ and drone up hard (which is also good because then they don't have units to defend the attack).

2) It provides a back up plan. If the attack doesn't go 100% as planned, you can always start making probes 3 at a time and transfer them down while starting to tech up. That way if things ever go wrong you aren't 100% all in (hence the "semi" from earlier).

3) Extra chronoboost for gateways. A small addition, however a nice one if you can spend your chronoboost well.

A small note that I feel would be a good addition to this build that coincides with the 2nd point above. I think as you are moving out (or as your +1 is finishing) you should get a twilight council as well. This makes it easier to transition into +2 blink and beyond if your initial pressure can't finish them off and since the build itself doesn't starve you for money, there is no harm in getting it.

The other benefit to this build is that you don't even have to all in with it if you don't want to. You can do the same opener and if you see the zerg being greedy and you want to play greedy too, then by all means go for it. You took a 6:50 3rd base. While I still suggest pressuring at least a little bit (to maybe deny the 4th) you can still be probing up constantly behind it and teching as well.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'PartinG Proxy Stalker Rush', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This cheese proxies your initial Pylon at your opponent?s natural and makes Stalkers 2 at a time from 2 proxied Gateways. This proxy Stalker Rush is a very effective cheese that focuses on early game micro to destroy your opponent before the midgame.

Scouting

This build skips all scouting, for you are placing your first Pylon proxied at your opponent?s natural expansion regardless of what your opponent is doing. All of your scouting will come from your initial attack with your first Gateway units. The build itself will not change regardless of what you scout ? only your unit positioning and micro.

Transitions

This proxy Stalker Rush is an all-in in every respect: proxying the initial Pylon at your opponent?s natural, cutting Probe production at 12, non-stop chronoboosting your Gateways, and skipping Warpgate Research. Thus, there is no well-defined transition. If you are late in your execution and do not outright kill your opponent (or at least take out their army and 10+ Probes), then you will most likely lose the game to any sort of Gateway attack follow-up.

Tips

- ALL OF YOUR CHRONOBOOST MUST BE DUMPED INTO YOUR GATEWAYS. The limiting factor on this build is how fast you can pump out units from your Gateways. Be sure to non-stop chronoboost your Gateways as they are producing the Zealot and later Stalkers so as to attack as early as possible.
- Poke in with your first Zealot and Probe and force your opponent to lose mining time. However, be wary of a Probe surround. Favor keeping the Zealot alive over killing enemy Probes.
- Once your first 2 Stalkers finish, you must commit to the attack as quickly as possible and never stop Stalker production until either you have won the game or you have lost all of your units. The strength of this all-in is how quickly and ferociously it attacks, but if you are not constantly attacking then your opponent?s economic advantage can destroy you.
- If your opponent pulls a lot of Probes to defend, be sure to back off and fight near the main ramp. Use your 18 Pylon to buffer damage and provide high ground vision for your Stalkers to shoot up the cliff.

Pros and Cons

This proxy Stalker Rush is a hyper-aggressive all-in that is able to get 2 Stalkers and 1 Zealot at your opponent?s base at 4:00. Because of how quickly this build attacks, it can punish most greedy PvP builds or players with poor micro with ease.
Unfortunately, this all-in can be scouted because your initial buildings must all be built in your opponent?s natural.  However, it being easy to scout and easy to defend are two fundamentally different things, so you can still win with this build quite often.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Gateway,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Zealot,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Stalker,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Stalker,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:29 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Polt Gas First Banshee', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This gas first Banshee opener used by Polt and many other top level Korean Terrans opens with the fastest Cloaked Banshees possible. The Banshee(s) are used to stay safe against early attacks as well as harass your opponent, in order to get an economic advantage going into the midgame.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your Orbital Command to check whether or not your opponent is opening with Reapers. Against an opponent opening Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe; thus, you should try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or expanded at your natural with your first few Marines.

Your next scout will come with your Banshee. With this Banshee, you can check what your opponents opener is. Against another Banshee player, follow-up your first Banshee with a Raven (and then potentially Viking if extra anti-air is needed). Against a Hellbat dropping player, make a few Widow Mines to burrow defensively against any incoming drop, as you use several Banshees to out-harass him. Against a player going for a Widow Mine Drop, position your Marines defensively at home and be sure to have enough scans to deal with his Widow Mines. Building a Raven might be useful, but not until after you have 2 Banshees with which to harass your opponent.

Finally, be sure to keep an eye out on what midgame transition your opponent is doing. Look for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either all-in, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play quite easily.

For an all-in transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory and start Siege Tank production instantly. When you hit 2 or 3 Siege Tanks, grab all of your Marines (>20), your Banshees/Vikings, and attempt to break your opponents front with a slow siege push.

It is possible to go into Marine/Tank or Mech after a 3 Command Center follow-up if you are sure your opponent will not be going for any more early game pressure. Start a Raven in order to save enough minerals to afford 2 Command Centers and then transition into either Marine/Tank or Mech just as below.

When transitioning into macro Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production after you start a 2nd Command Center. That way you have enough defense early and later can have a strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use. Against 2rax Reaper, you should delay your Tech lab until your Factory has completed at least one Hellion. Otherwise you might straight up die before you even start your first Banshee.
- Watch for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop your Banshee as you enter your opponents base.  Cloak your Banshee as soon as you see any potential for burrowed Widow Mines.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that are undefended by a Turret. If you are transitioning to a 1/1/1 all-in, then be sure to target-fire Marines as well, for this directly strengthens your attack.
- Always favor keeping your Banshee(s) alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two. You can also repair a weakened Banshee at home with SCVs if you can keep it alive.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural.  You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This gas first Banshee build is an aggressive opener in TvT. Also, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for you are able to transition into an all-in, 3 Command Center play, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play. Also, this build requires a lot less APM than other TvT builds, so it can be very useful for lower league players.

However, this build is extraordinarily weak against early Reaper builds because you open with so few Marines. Also, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind your opponent in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades, especially if they open with a fast expansion. Finally, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,SCV,Factory,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,Refinery,SCV,Marine,Starport,TechLabOnFactory,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,LandStarportOnTechLab,Banshee,CloakingField,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,CallMule,WidowMine,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Banshee,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:30 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Polt Reaper FE into 3 Rax', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE gets out a lot of units quickly in order to defend any Oracle or Blink Stalker attacks, while transitioning directly into completely standard 2 Base bio infrastructure. The versatility of this build sets it apart from the other TvP openers: Polts build lets you defend, attack, or play off any shenanigans your opponent may through at you.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they get an expansion (or note if they do not expand by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Extra Bunkers and/or an Engineering Bay for defense may be a smart investment.

If your opponent is going for a 2 Base Blink Stalker attack, then slow down your tech and gas income in favor of more units and more Bunkers. Start 2 Bunkers at the front and be ready to repair them with SCVs while you buy time for Combat Shields, more Marauders, and eventual Medivacs to pop.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and a large Bio army.  As you are taking map control with your initial Medivacs, be sure to add a 3rd Command Center, 2 more Barracks, and finish getting Concussive Shells and Combat Shields. Add on another Engineering Bay and an Armory to continue your upgrades as soon as you can afford it.

Note that you can switch the order of the 4th and 5th Barracks with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost and the scary late game Protoss army, most Terrans have been getting their infrastructure up early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having extra reinforcements.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important; if you keep all of your SCVs in gas, then you will not have the minerals to get your Command Center or extra Barracks at the correct time.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper.  Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add up to 2 Bunkers at the front, and start that Marauder production as soon as possible.
- Oracles massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you should consider skipping Marauders for more Marines or even start an emergency Engineering Bay for one turret per mineral line.
- Polt sometimes goes for an optional poke with his initial Marauder and several Marines if he has confirmed his opponent is not going for a Stargate. Be sure to keep these units alive  their only purpose is to take up a central XelNaga Watch tower
- When transitioning into the midgame, setting up your infrastructure while being aggressive with your first few Medivacs can outright win you the game.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because of the versatility inherent in its play. It makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game, gets up enough infrastructure to deal with all early and midgame attacks such as Oracle all-ins or Blink Stalker Timings, and then transitions into a completely standard bio midgame. It truly is an effective build to learn if you want to play safe and standard in TvP.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that it requires good scouting in order to take advantage of the versatility inherent in the build.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GoOutScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,MineralScv,CallMule,SCV,CommandCenter,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,Marine,StimPack,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,DoubleMarines,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,Factory,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,ScannerSweep,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,CallMule,Refinery,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,EngineeringBay,Marine,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,DoubleMarines,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,CombatShield,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,SCV,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMedivacs,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,ConcussiveShells,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:30 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Rain 1 gate FE to Colossus', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This safe fast expand build opens with a 1gate FE and then transitions into Colossi and double upgrades as fast as possible in order to go into the late game with an upgrade and tech advantage over a Terran opponent.

Benchmark: @100% +1/+1 (@10:30ish), you should have around 55 Probes, 1 Sentry, and 2 Colossi.

Scouting

This is a very safe macro build, getting you enough units in the early game for scouting or defensive purposes, so Probe scouting is usually unnecessary.  If your opponent sends a Reaper at your base, then be defensive with your initial Zealot/Stalker, and use only your Mothership Core to scout around.  If your opponent does NOT send a Reaper at your base, then poke out with your initial Zealot/Stalker and later Mothership Core to poke at your opponent?s front and glean some information about their build.

While your early game is completely safe, therefore making Probe scouting irrelevant, the early midgame is not, and thus scouting is crucial. If you know that your opponent is going for a Widow Mine drop, then get out Observers and several more Stalkers and place them defensively in each mineral line. Be prepared to use the Mothership Core?s Photon Overcharge on whichever Nexus your opponent chooses to drop. Delay Colossus tech in order to favor more units to deal with the harass. This same reaction works against all early drop-based or Banshee play. Against any early frontal assaults, simply Planetary Nexus your natural expansion and warp-in several more units.

Transitions

This build is quite macro-oriented, so playing for the long-game is crucial.  Against standard Bio play, Bio/Mine play, or Bio/Hellbat play, take your third base after your 3rd Colossus and transition into Chargelots, Archons, and Storm. Add more Gateways as your minerals permit. Also, Blink is a good upgrade to prioritize against heavy drop play on maps with a large distance between your main and third bases.

Against Mech play, take your third base and begin heavy Immortal production.  Make Immortals, Archons, and High Templar while on 3 bases, and focus on hitting a +3/+3 timing attack before your opponent is maxed.  Add more Robotics Facilities as your gas permits.

Pros and Cons

This build stays safe against early shenanigans as you macro up and tech straight for Colossus and +1/+1. It also gives you the infrastructure necessary to defend early drops or harassment common in this matchup.  With your upgrade lead and tech advantage, you can safely transition into the lategame by safely taking another base and going for Storm.

Tips

- Chronoboost your initial Nexus to get out as many probes as early as possible to kick start your economy.
- Use your initial units defensively if you spot a Reaper, or aggressively to scout your opponent?s base if no Reaper appears at your door by the time your Stalker has popped.
- Send your first Observer directly to your opponent?s base in order to see if he?s opening with fast Widow Mines/harassing units, or teching up to a normal Bio timing. Only warp-in units before you get your first Colossus out if you scout your opponent playing aggressively. Delay your Colossus tech and production if you spot your opponent going for a quick drop or early attack play. Instead, focus on making Gateway units and Observers and placing them defensively to maintain your economic advantage. However, if your opponent is NOT attacking early, always prioritize economy and teching up over making Gateway units
- Never underestimate the power of making your Nexus a Planetary Nexus.  At the very least, it is a way to scare off a drop from doing economic damage if your army is out of position.
- Against early drops, target firing the Medivac with your Stalkers and Planetary Nexus can mean the difference between letting your opponent escape and crushing a poorly planned drop.

This build rushes for Thors and a Medivac as fast as possible and then goes for a hilarious all-in with Thor Drops. There is no transition with this build  you pull all your SCVs and crush your opponent as soon as possible.

Scouting

There is no purpose scouting. You are going to do the same build no matter what, and it only wastes mining time to pull an SCV from the mineral line.

Transitions

There are no transitions from this all-in. Keep rallying Marines and your next Thor and all of your SCVs and hope it is enough to win the game.

Tips

- When your Medivac pops, load up your Thor and drop your opponent, trying to kill production or SCVs.
- Avoid fighting your opponents army with your initial Thor drop at all costs. Only engage your opponents army directly once your Marines and SCVs are in the fight as well.
- Make sure to pull around 10 SCVs and attack with all of your Marines when you start your 2nd Thor so that your 2 Thors, 12 Marines, and 10 SCVs all get to your opponents base at the same time.
- During the fight, surround your Thor(s) with SCVs and repair.
- Use your Marines for a bit of extra DPS as they sit behind your Thor(s), but the true power of this all-in comes from the fact that Thors being repaired take close to no damage from early game Terran units.

Pros and Cons

This build rolls over most 1rax FE builds. Also, its a hilarious all-in that straight up kills unprepared opponents or opponents who dont have good repair micro. Also, a huge pro is that this build IS A THOR DROP.

However, this build is very weak against Reapers because you only have 2 Marines to defend against Reapers in the early game. That being said, if you can ward off the Reapers without losing too many SCVs, you might still win because Thors are obviously strong against Reapers in direct fights.

Everything about the opener is extremely safe (besides the late MSCore which can easily be added in if you suspect some form of 2 base all in) and completely standard. It even incorporates an early zealot just in case. If you want you can get rid of the zealot if you know 100% that they won't be doing any form of speedling bust or whatever so that way you can get all the timings slightly quicker. However, for the added security the early zealot gives you outweighs getting the pressure at their base 5 seconds earlier for the most part. The build also gives off a very normal feel. A zerg will easily look at this and think it's a standard every day phoenix into colossus passive macro opening. This helps in with the attack later on.

There have been other variants of this kind of build that are slightly more all in, (sentry drop version, 7 gate version etc.) where if you do enough damage you'll be fine to macro out if you can't out right kill them however if you get shut down completely you're basically lose.This version only has 4 gates and zealots and gets a quicker robo bay in exchange so that way it still packs a big punch with the +1 and 8 zealots at once (4 warped in before loaded up and 4 warped in on location) while not needing to do an excessive amount of damage to be able to macro out of it afterwords.

In regards to actually macroing out of it, it's quite simple. Just start colossus production as your harassment is going on so that way if he tries to counter attack if the attack is held then you'll have something to defend a 3rd base easily. You should also try to squeeze in a few sentries if you notice the attack won't benefit from any additional warp ins.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Reaper FE into 3 Rax Stim Timing', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE transitions into a very quick 2 base Stim timing with Combat Shields. With such a fast attack, you can set the pace of the game instead of letting Protoss dictate when you attack.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they get an expansion (or note if they do not expand by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Extra Bunkers and/or an Engineering Bay for defense may be a smart investment. However, if you can hold until Stimpack and Combat Shields finish (@8:50ish  much earlier than most other builds), then you will be in a great position to counter attack your opponent and do crippling damage.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and a large Bio army.  Before you focus on your attack, be sure to start a Factory for a standard Reactored Medivac follow-up. After the attack, get a 3rd Command Center, 2 more Barracks (for a total of 5), 2 Engineering Bays, and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to head into a strong, late game army.

Note that you can switch the order of the 4th and 5th Barracks with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost and the scary late game Protoss army, most Terrans have been getting their infrastructure up early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having extra reinforcements.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important; if you keep all of your SCVs in gas, then you will not have the minerals to get your Command Center or extra Barracks at the correct time.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add up to 2 Bunkers at the front, and start that Marauder production as soon as possible.
- Oracles massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you should consider skipping Marauders for more Marines or even start an emergency Engineering Bay for one turret per mineral line. Note that even if your opponent does early game damage with an Oracle, your 9 minute attack can still end the game if your opponents follow-up is not executed precisely.
- Be sure to move out with your army BEFORE Stimpack and Combat Shields finish. You want to be attacking your opponents natural expansion as soon as those two upgrades finish.
- If your opponent is out of position, you can kill their entire army or snipe their natural expansion. However, be sure that you focus fire one or the other down  losing too much DPS by having your units attack both the Nexus and the army is the main way to screw up the attack.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because of how many units you can get out for a pre-10 minute attack. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Therefore, this build is a much more aggressive variant of the other Reaper expands possible in TvP.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that with such a low Marine count in the early game, fast Oracles can do a lot of damage if your scouting is not perfect.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,GoOutScv,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Barracks,SCV,DoubleMarines,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,DoubleMarines,OrbitalCommand,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,DoubleMarines,StimPack,Marine,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,CombatShield,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,Factory,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marauder,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,Starport,Refinery,ReactorOnFactory,EngineeringBay,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,CallMule,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,InfantryWeaponsLevel1', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:31 PM;

This Reaper FE gets out a fast Factory so that you can defend any early Protoss pressure with Widow Mines and Bunkers. It then transitions into standard Bio play for a 10 minute Medivac attack.

Scouting

The very beginning of this build is somewhat fragile (opening with a Reaper FE means that you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper.  Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they expand (or note if they do not get a fast expansion by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play as you sacrifice your Reaper into your opponents base. If you are playing against a 1 basing Protoss, then constantly produce Widow Mines  do not just stop at 1. Also, if you do not know whether or not your opponent has built a Stargate, building a Bunker in your main mineral line for 4 Marines to sit in and shoot any early game Oracles is not a bad idea too.

Push out when your first set of Medivacs finish (@10:10ish) with 3 Medivacs, around 6 Marauders and 26 Marines, and 53 SCVs at home

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and Medivacs. After this build, get Concussive Shells, take a 3rd Command Center, continue your upgrades by getting and Armory and another Engineering Bay, build 2 more Barracks, and react to whatever midgame splash damage your opponent is getting. Against Colossi, get a 2nd Starport; against Storm, get a Ghost Academy.

Tips

- If you are not comfortable with pulling SCVs in and out of gas, then simply ignore the two notes telling you to pull an SCV out of and then later put one more into gas (at 15 and 22 supply).
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper.  Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), then continue making Widow Mines.  Also, consider moving your natural to your main base and defending on one base.
- Oracles massacre un-upgraded Marines, so position your Widow Mines effectively.  Also consider adding a Bunker in your mineral line if your opponent has a Stargate to further defend Oracle pressure.
- If your opponent is not playing aggressively, then drop your Widow Mine(s) and Marines at your opponents base.  Do not over commit if your opponent already has a detection/Cannons ready for you.
- This build gives you enough gas to start Marauder production much earlier than most other builds.  Be sure to ramp up your Marauder production early in order to make a beefier army than your opponent.
- Move out as soon as your Medivacs pop.  Stimpack, while not yet done, should finish by the time you get to your opponents base.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because it gives you the economy and infrastructure on par with a Wings of Liberty style 1rax FE. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Not to mention the fact that you start Widow Mine production very early in order to stay safe against any potential Protoss aggression.

However, this build is somewhat vulnerable to early Protoss pokes, especially if you lose your Reaper.

This Roach/Baneling all-in takes advantage of greedy Terran play by hitting a Terran before his midgame infrastructure can be set up with a huge swell of Roaches and Banelings.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of very early force, make a few Speedlings to stay safe. However, do NOT overproduce early game units because this will slow down your push.
Your next scout will be with an Overlord as soon as you start your Roach Warren (around 6:30). This is merely to scout whether your opponent is opening with Hellbats. If he is, then do not produce more than 1 wave of Banelings ? favor Roaches to defend your Drones at home as you attack the front with the same push.
The next scout will be with your initial Roach Warren attack. Try to force a Widow Mine to detonate with a Speedling or two before you commit to the attack. Also, with your all-in, you will see what units your opponent has because all of them must be at the front in order to defend.

Transitions

Because this build is an all-in, there is no true transition to this build. However, once you destroy at least one base of SCVs, you can transition out of the attack and get economically ahead. Drone up your 3rd base and continue into a macro game, instead of pushing up the main ramp in a potentially bad engagement.
If you do choose to drone up, start 2 Evolution Chambers and a Lair instantly, along with your 3rd and 4th Extractors. You?ll likely want +1 Melee over +1 Ranged, though you have the option to transition into any composition involving any combination of Zerglings/Banelings/Roaches that you are most comfortable with.
The obvious transition would be to hit a follow-up push on 3 bases with +1 Melee and +1 Carapace, with both Roach and Baneling Speed. This should hit around 13:30, only 3:30 later than a straight 3base Lair tech Roach/Baneling bust.

Tips

- Hide your Roaches for as long as possible before you move out. The less time you give your opponent to react to your build, the better your chance at crushing through their front.
- Make a bunch of Overlords BEFORE you need to make all of your units. Making Overlords during a fight is a sure way to get supply blocked.
- Use Banelings to bust a wall at the natural. Then, all high priority Baneling targets are: packs of Marines/SCVs, researching Tech labs, and the central structure on the top of the ramp.
- Do NOT over commit your Roaches if you are waiting on a second wave of Banelings to morph. It is completely fine to pull back whilst you wait for another round of Banelings. Zerglings and Banelings can be replaced; your Roaches cannot.
- Do NOT over commit up your opponent?s main ramp unless you are absolutely sure that you can push through and win the game with the attack. Favor droning up your 3rd base and transitioning into a macro game over potentially taking a bad engagement up the main ramp.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any player going for a Tank-less 3 Command Center build (the current metagame). Also, because you take your third base before moving out, it is easy to stop Zergling/Baneling production and saturate your third base in order to transition into a standard 3 base Zerg vs 2 base Terran macro game. Also, as a Zerg player, the engagement itself is quite easy to micro.
However, if you cannot do damage with the Roach/Bane attack, then you will be economically behind the Terran opponent. Also, because it is an all-in, this build is quite difficult to transition out of.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Drone,SpawningPool,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,MetabolicBoost,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Queen,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,RoachWarren,Extractor,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Overlord,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,SpawnCreepTumor,BanelingNest,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:31 PM;

This build opens with some light Stalker pressure and then follows up with a 3gate Blink Stalker all-in, using the Mothership Core for high ground vision and Time Warp.

Blink into the main when Blink finishes (@7:40ish) with 12 Stalkers and 25 Probes at home.

Scouting

This build is an aggressive opener that makes a lot of units, so you will not have to worry about Probe scouting. Against Reaper play, keep your first Stalker on a common hop-up ledge in order to deny your opponent scouting the Twilight Council. Against other defensive play, poke out to your opponent?s front with your first Stalker and check to see whether your opponent is going for Widow Mines or a quick CC into Bio so you know how to micro when you Blink into his main base with all of your units.

Transitions

This build is an all-in, so there is no standard follow-up. If your attack does damage and you keep most of your units alive, then you can take a natural expansion and transition into Upgrades+Storm. However, if you do not do significant damage with your initial Stalkers and also lose them, you are most likely out of the game because your midgame tech and economy will be vastly behind that of your opponent.

Tips

- Do not bother Probe scouting, you can do this build against nearly everything your opponent chooses to open with.
- With your initial Stalkers, either protect your main base from a Reaper scouting your Twilight Council or move out and poke up at your opponent?s base for some early scouting intel.
- The limiting factor with this build is Blink Research?s build time, so be sure to Chronoboost that Research constantly in order to attack as soon as possible.
- Keep your Mothership Core out of harm?s way. Use its 14 sight range for high ground vision, but do not commit the Mothership Core in the attack because without high ground vision, your attack will most likely fail.
- Do not forget to use your Mothership Core?s Time Warp ability to help pick off SCVs or Bio units that are out of position.
- Do NOT over-commit your Stalkers in a risky blink. Only aggressively blink to get up to a high ground or to pick off a Siege Tank/Widow Mine before it activates.
- Constantly warping-in more Stalkers to reinforce your army and add strength to the attack is key to crushing through your opponent?s defenses.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong build because of how quickly you get both high ground vision with your Mothership Core and enough Blink Stalkers to do real damage.

However, this build is in fact an all-in, so there is no standard transition should the attack fail.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'SaSe DT Rush', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This DT rush opens with a 3 Stalker Rush for safety and map control, and then gets out fast DTs either for offense (taking advantage of your opponent?s possible lack of detection early on) or defense (applying pressure while you safely take an expansion of your own).

Scouting

This build is a pretty unsafe build in general, only giving you 3-5 units for the early game timings, thus scouting is huge. However, because this build was created by SaSe, you are also low on minerals for quite some time and thus cannot afford losing mining time by scouting with a Probe.  Therefore, in the early game merely scout in your base for a proxy Gateway with the Probe who builds the 2nd Pylon; the rest of your scouting will come from your 3 Stalkers. Being active with these 3 Stalkers around your natural, third, and watchtower will prevent your opponent from sneaking proxy Pylons past you and hitting you with a very early Gateway attack. Thus, you will be able to see an incoming push coming before it?s too late, and can delay/cancel your fast expand in favor of more units if you need to.

Transitions

This build transitions very smoothly into Chargelot/Archon builds or Blink Stalker builds. To make either transition, first resume chronoboosting out probes from both Nexi and then start your research of choice (Charge or Blink). Adding on 2 more Gateways, and applying midgame pressure with lots of Gateways and 1 or 2 Archons is a great way to force units out of your opponent, scout what midgame tech he?s going, and possibly end the game if your DTs did too much damage.

Pros and Cons

This build is great because it gets a reasonably timed expansion, gives you DTs early for map control and potential game-ending damage, and lets you transition into an aggressive midgame with either Chargelots or Blink Stalkers at the core of your army composition.
However, this build is very weak vs Oracle openers, for they give both detection and a great way to harass your naked mineral line. Also, against early attacks that hit before your Dark Shrine finishes, if you miss the proxy Pylon because you are not active enough with your first three stalkers, you can straight up lose the game.

This build opens with the fastest possible Dark Templar in order to keep your opponent pinned in their base as well as some light harass, while you safely transition into a 2 base economy and either a Robotics or Blink focused play.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker back to the protection of your Mothership Core quickly if you have to defend an early attack. Hold on with Photon Overcharge until you can warp-in a DT to defend as well as harass.

This build is surprisingly safe against most openings, so scouting is pretty minimal.

Against standard Robo expand builds, your Nexus will be a little bit later.  You can make up for this either by using Warp Prism/DT harass or doing a Blink follow up to abuse their low production capability.

Against Blink play, simply take advantage of their lack of detection and kill a bunch of Probes. Against Dark Templar play, use your Observer and Stalker to push back their DTs while your(s) kill a bunch of Probes.

Against Stargate play, you might run into some problems. Phoenix will be able to scout what you are doing, and Oracles provide detection as well as harass potential.

Transitions

This build sets you up with a 2 base economy and both a Robotics Facility and Twilight Council. This lets you transition into either midgame Blink timings or Chargelot/Archon/Immortal macro play very easily.

To transition into Blink play, start and chronoboost Blink from your Twilight Council as soon as your first Dark Templar is warped in. Go up to 5 Gateways on 2 Assimilators and warp-in Blink Stalkers non-stop at your opponents base in order to punish typically greedy play in reaction to DT expand builds.

To transition into Chargelot/Archon/Immortal play, start Immortal production, a Forge, and go up to 3 Gateways. Once you are safely in the midgame, start Charge and be sure to out-expand your opponent.

Tips

- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial Stalker to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap?s 3gate All-in).
- You may want to proxy 2 Pylons with this build. One for the initial hidden Dark Shrine. The second for a close warp-in location for your initial DT.
- Un-chronoboosted Warpgate will time out perfectly with your Dark Shrine finishing
- Against Stargate play, be sure to position your initial units to defend your mineral line from potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- In the midgame, spend all of your Chronoboost on either the Robotics Facility or Twilight Council?depending on your transition.

Pros and Cons

This build is a reasonably safe build that allows you harass potential as well as forces your opponent to stay at home. It also expands at a normal time in order to get to the midgame quickly and transition smoothly into either a fast timing or macro play.

The build is a very straight forward 13 gate 15 double gas opener with3 on eachthat gets a Stargate right when the Cyber is done and then a MSCore for obvious reasons. Something that sOs doesn't do in his build is get an early stalker. I feel like it's a bit risky/greedy to do this and I feel more comfortable adding the stalker in, so I did. The small impact this has is that your 3rd phoenix will have a delay on it. It's not the biggest of deals in my opinion and I feel like it's better to feel safer with the early stalker to help try to scout for proxies and whatnot.

The robo comes early enough so that way DTs are not a problem at all. You'll easily be able to scout the dark shrine with your phoenix, the observer should come out right as the DT is getting to your base andyou can easily lift itand not lose a single unit. From there you'll have free reign over his probe line with your phoenix.

For the most part you should be getting your Nexus as early as possible right after the first warp in. Unless you think they're doing a 1 base all in there's no real reason to start the immortal before the nexus. In sOs' game vs Creator it seemed like he wasn't 100% certain if Creator was going to try and blink all in or not, so he played it safe and got the immortal before the nexus.

Reactions to certain builds

Early gateway timings

These are the only tricky things to stop with this build. Since you're not really making any units it's obvious that a 4gate might be a little hard to stop. The best thing you can really do is to identify that it's happening asap (with your probe scout) and prepare by getting3gates of your own and going intovoid rays. You'll have to use overcharge to buy timefor everything to finish and you'll need some fancy micro. Don't be afraid topull probes right awayto catch him off guard and get a surround off. Early probe pulls can be really good since their unit count isn't totally out of control and it can really swing the edge in your favor quickly since 4gates really only have 2 warp in cycles or so until they stop being effective. This will also force them to back away and allow your void ray to stay targeted for a while dealing out some extra damage. It'll have to be a dance, but it's definitely possible.

Stargate openers

It's really quite simple. If your stargate is faster than theirs and you get the phoenix out first, you should win easily. Take control of the skies and force them onto the ground and you can either follow up by taking an early nexus and harassing like normal, or throwing down 2 extra gates and try ending it with a phoenix/gateway all in. This is very effective since they will only have gateway tech available to them since the tech they invested in got shut down completely. If you get 4-5 phoenix and just lift up 4-5 units, all of a sudden half his army isn't in the fight and it's an easy win.

If their stargate is faster than yours, be sure to identify that right away. This stargate is basically the fastest possible off a normal opening, so the only thing faster than yours is an 11 gate stargate which you should be able to scout before you even drop you own stargate. So you canswitch to blinkif you want and go from there.

Blink openers

This is also quite simple since you are getting such a fast robo. Make sure to identify whether they're going for an all in or a macro build. If it's an all in, then simply start making immortals ASAP and chrono them out while using the phoenix to deny any high ground vision and just forcefield for days. They will probablytry to contain you, so keep the phoenix alive. Once you have a few immortals you canlift the sentriesthey have so you can bust down the ramp and force them away and take an expansion. Try to do this as early as possible so their expansion isn't too far ahead of yours and so they don't have like 3-4 sentries there.

While they will have a faster expansion than you,you have full map control. This is where this build truly shines. Three phoenix can do wonders to a mineral line that's not easily defended. Even though their expansion will be quicker, it won't even matter because of the amount of damage you can do with your phoenix. The amount of resources required to defend 2 mineral lines from phoenix is a huge hit that early and it will really fuck with their timings for anything else. You can play completely greedy behind the phoenix and just chrono probes and get a quick forge and everything.You have full control of the gamein this situation.

Transition to mid game

Once you have your expansion then the rest is up to you really. The few things you 100% will need shortly after the nexus goes down are aforge, robo bay or twilight council, natural gasses.The build leaves you in control with the phoenix and gives you full scouting potential so it's very easy to react to what he's doing. Once you identify that they're going macro you need to put a forge down ASAP so you don't fall behind on upgrades. Shortly after that should be your tech of choice (whether it be colossi or twilight for immortal/archon). I personally prefer colossi since you already have the robo and it's a much quicker and safer transition. Twilight takes a little long and also diversifies your tech a little too much. You'll be spreading yourself too thin and if you realize that they're going to do some 2 base timing to kill you shortly after your nexus is up then you're going to have a hard time defending since you won't really have anything to defend with. From there you just play a standard macro PvP really.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Stargate,WarpgateUpgrade,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Pylon,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Phoenix,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Pylon,Phoenix,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Probe,Phoenix,Chronoboost,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,WarpInSentry,WarpInZealot,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Immortal,Chronoboost,Probe,Nexus', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:31 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Scarlett Macro Mutalisk Style', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

The definitive macro build of modern ZvT, Scarlett?s fast 3 Hatch style quickly transitions into the most commonly used composition of Zergling, Baneling, Mutalisk. Utilizing a gasless opener with a high Queen count and fast upgrades, this is by far the best build with which to learn ZvT.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of very early force, make a few Zerglings to stay safe. However, do NOT overproduce early game units because this will slow down your 3 base saturation, and thus your midgame strength. Your next scout will be with an Overlord just after you start your +1/+1 (@7:15ish). This is merely to scout whether your opponent is opening with 3 base Bio play, 3 base Mech play, or a 2 base timing. If your opponent is going Mech, immediately abandon this build. Zerglings and Banelings are highly ineffective against Hellbats, Hellions, and Siege Tanks, so begin violently tech switching based off of Terran?s composition; Mutalisks for Tanks, Swarm Hosts for Hellbat Thor, etc. Continuing Mutalisk production is fine, but be sure to take a much earlier 5th base and Infestation Pit, as well as a Roach Warren. If your opponent is opening bio, proceed as the build dictates.

Transitions

As soon as you confirm that your opponent is going for a 3rd Command Center, feel free to start your 4th Hatchery. Against Mech play, transitioning into Swarm Hosts, Mutalisks, or Vipers is very strong. Against Bio/Mine play, transitioning into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk or mass Zergling/Baneling is also quite strong. Assuming you have not scouted Mech, your transition into standard Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk should serve you fine against any bio based composition. Emphasize Zerglings against Bio/Mine, Banelings against Bio/Hellbat, and Mutalisks against Marine/Tank.

Tips

- Be sure that you take map control with your initial Zerglings. Being able to spot when and with what your opponent moves out on the map can be crucial in defending any early timings.
- Metabolic Boost will not finish until just before 8 minutes with this build. If your opponent is hitting you very early, then a Spine Crawler and/or extra Queens will be more useful than slow Zerglings.
- As above, beware Reapers pressuring the Drone that attempts to take your 3rd base. You will have to defend it cautiously with Queens and your slower Zerglings. This is where creep spread will greatly assist you.
- Just after you start your +1/+1 upgrades, be sure to send a sacrificial Overlord into your opponent?s base to check whether your opponent is going for a Mech or Bio build.
- Against a Banshee based opener, over-produce Queens and conserve energy for Transfuses, without compromising either your creep spread or your injects too much.
- Be aware of the flow of each Terran composition. For example, Bio/Mine typically means non stop aggression, so usage of static defense to buy time and Mutalisks to intercept reinforcements is critical.
- Mutalisks are prioritized in this build over the other two components; Zerglings and Banelings. It is important to be as active with them as possible without compromising your macro.
- Against Bio/Mine, engage in small groups whenever possible to abuse the long cooldown of Widow Mines to the maximum effect.
- Against Bio/Hellbat/Thor, be sure to emphasize a ground army instead of a Mutalisk based composition. More Banelings and a faster hive are highly recommended, and be sure to fight on creep to get the best possible Baneling connections.
- Be aware of the standard creep clearing push that every bio Terran executes between 10 to 12 minutes, using their first two Medivacs, 15 to 25 Marines with Combat Shield/Stimpack, and the survivors of the Reaper/Hellion squad; be sure to have Banelings ready to defend, and surrender non essential creep tumors (any tumors placed upon paths he will not attack on).
- Using the Mutalisks to deny the fourth base as long as possible is critical to victory. Because you have made so many Mutalisks, your own Hive Tech will be delayed, so you must delay Terran as long as possible in turn.
- The build gets looser and more flexible as the game goes on, as is to be expected. As you are first trying out this build, you will either be far too greedy, and die with too many Drones, or far too safe, and die with not enough Drones. Constantly adjust the ratio of Drones to units based upon what you scout and the flow of the game, and learn the precise moments when you are completely free to Drone, and when you are not to maximize your success with this build.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong against almost all standard Terran openers. It gets 4 Queens for safety, injects, creep spread, and to defend a very quick 3rd Hatchery. With such a fast third, your midgame economy is also quite solid. This build is also currently viewed as the best way to play macro ZvT. It has no inherent weaknesses, and thus will always guarantee that the better player wins the game.
However, because you delay your Extractors in favor of 4 Queens, this build is not as safe against 1 Base all-ins than an opener that gets a very fast Metabolic Boost. Additionally, because you are opening gasless, Reaper openers have to be defended purely with Queens and your Terran opponent may be more inclined to play much greedier than he normally would against a gas opener.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Queen,InjectLarva,Queen,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Hatchery,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Overlord,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,EvolutionChamber,EvolutionChamber,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,MeleeAttacksLevel1,GroundCarapaceLevel1,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Lair,SpawnCreepTumor,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,BanelingNest,Drone,Hatchery,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Spire,PneumatizedCarapace,Hatchery,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,CentrifugalHooks,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,MeleeAtacksLevel2,GroundCarapaceLevel2,Overseer,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,FlyerCarapaceLevel1,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:31 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'sOs Hallucination 3gate Blink', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'This build is a much safer variant of blink and can respond to absolutely any build they would go for. The build stays defensive with the early units and MSCore so that you don't die to any sort of proxies/cheese and then uses a 5:45 hallucination to scout exactly what tech they're going for.

With this build DTs are a tad tricky though, so I added in my own little idea to stay safe vs them. At 6:00 is when you normally drop a robo to be safe vs DTs in a standard blink/obs build, however the hallucination scout doesn't normally get into their base until 20-30 seconds after that time has passed. This can lead to straight up losses due to not having a robo up in time. So since you have the money to make the robo at 6:00 still with this build it's a good idea to make it incase of DTs (especially if your early probe scout sniffed out DT tech) and then once your hallucination scouts their base you can cancel it if you see no evidence of DTs being made and react accordingly. You can also keep it if you want and do an even safer version of the build, however it will hinder your aggressive options and delay your nexus a bit.

If they go stargate then you can easily drop a 4th gate and go all in with blink. Be sure to leave the MSCore home to defend against oracles and use the hallucination from the sentry a 2nd time to get vision into their main to blink in there and catch them by surprise.

If they go blink as well then you'll need to gauge the situation. It's best to just make some stalkers and keep some form of map presence as you can and then expand behind it while getting a robo. This is where keeping the 6 minute robo is an OK decision because then you can go into immortals faster for a more defensive option incase he decides to all in with blink. There's also the off chance that they hid the dark shrine and you don't see it so keeping the robo after seeing a twilight only is still fine.

The cool thing with this build that CranK told me to do is to proxy a stargate for an oracle if you see them open greedier than you. This makes perfect sense since the only real downside to opening macro blink builds is that it's hard to pressure them and get ahead if they open for a greedier build than you. The initial blink stalkers will force them into stopping probes and going defensive for fear of a blink all in, however in the mean time an oracle is being made close to their base. They most likely will use overcharge at their natural as well so the main is left completely undefended for the oracle. All this time you were making probes and expanding yourself and all of a sudden you're on even footing once more. You can also take a greedier 3rd base since the oracle/blink combo will keep them on the defensive even more so than any other normal build.

Once you get your expansion up you can continue in whatever way you please whether that be with a fast +2 chargelot/immortal/archon all in or with standard colossus play.

This Speedling all-in is a cheese designed to hard and blind-counter a Gateway Expanding Protoss player in the current metagame. It also has varying success against a FFE, depending on your opponent?s building placement.

Scouting

You only need to Drone scout for the Protoss on a 4 player map such as Whirlwind or Red City. Your early Spawning Pool prevents you from having the minerals to scout with a Drone on any other map. Instead of scouting with your units, the vast majority of your scouting will come from your initial Overlords? vision. Also, you do not need to scout for any Protoss cheeses because cheese should counter any of their cheeses quite effectively.

Transitions

Because this build is straight-up cheese, there is no true transition to this build. However, if you do damage and want to continue into a macro game, take a natural Hatchery and start a 2nd Queen to play a 2base, map control play style.

Tips

- Position your Overlords to give you vision of your opponent?s walls. Attacking the holes in your opponent?s building placement is crucial with this build, but that can only be easily done once you have vision of these holes.
- Use your initial 6 Zerglings to do as much damage as possible, along with scouting the Protoss for unusual play.
Avoid placing your Zerglings in a position where they can be surrounded by Probes and/or Zealots. Always retreat and poke in another area instead of committing to a bad position to get a guaranteed kill on a single target.
- Avoid a-clicking with your Zerglings. Rather, pick a target, move behind it to surround it, and then attack-move or target-fire the individual unit for a quick kill.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any Protoss player going for a Gateway Expand (the current metagame).  It is designed to do potentially game-winning damage against any player with sub-optimal building placement and Probe control.
However, it is significantly weaker against a Forge Fast Expanding player, for your Zerglings can only do damage where there are no Photon Cannons or wall-offs.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Extractor,Drone,Overlord,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn5Seconds,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MetabolicBoost,Queen,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:32 PM;

This aggressive build used by Liquid`TaeJa and many other top level Korean Terrans opens with a very standard Banshee build adapted to Heart of the Swarm and the cheaper Banshee Cloak upgrade. The Banshees are used to stay safe against early attacks as well as harass your opponent.

This build is VERY closely related to Polts Gas First Banshee Build  TaeJas version is just a Barracks first variant of Polts build.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your 1st Refinery to check whether or not your opponent is opening with Reapers. Against an opponent opening Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe; thus, you should try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or expanded at your natural with your first few Marines.

Your next scout will come with your Banshee. With this Banshee, you can check what your opponents opener is. Against another Banshee player, follow-up your first Banshee with a Raven (and then potentially Viking if extra anti-air is needed). Against a Hellbat dropping player, make a few Widow Mines to burrow defensively against any incoming drop, as you use several Banshees to out-harass him. Against a player going for a Widow Mine Drop, position your Marines defensively at home and be sure to have enough scans to deal with his Widow Mines. Building a Raven might be useful, but not until after you have 2 Banshees with which to harass your opponent.

Finally, be sure to keep an eye out on what midgame transition your opponent is doing. Look for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either all-in, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play quite easily.

For an all-in transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory and start Siege Tank production instantly. When you hit 2 or 3 Siege Tanks, grab all of your Marines (>20), your Banshees/Vikings, and attempt to break your opponents front with a slow siege push.

It is possible to go into Marine/Tank or Mech after a 3 Command Center follow-up if you are sure your opponent will not be going for any more early game pressure. Start a Raven in order to save enough minerals to afford 2 Command Centers and then transition into either Marine/Tank or Mech just as below.

When transitioning into macro Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production after you start a 2nd Command Center. That way you have enough defense early and later can have a strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy Siege Tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use.
- Watch for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop your Banshee as you enter your opponents base.  Cloak your Banshee as soon as you see any potential for burrowed Widow Mines.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that are undefended by a Turret.  If you are transitioning to a 1/1/1 all-in, then be sure to target-fire Marines as well.
- Always favor keeping your Banshee(s) alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two. You can also repair a weakened Banshee at home with SCVs if you can keep it alive.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural. You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This build is a standard, aggressive opener in TvT that both scouts and stays safe in the early game. Also, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for you are able to transition into an all-in, 3 Command Center play, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play. Also, this build requires a lot less APM than other TvT builds, so it can be very useful for lower league players.

However, this build is not quite as effective at killing workers as a Widow Mine Drop into Banshee build. Also, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind your opponent in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades, especially if they open with a fast expansion. Finally, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,Factory,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Refinery,SCV,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Starport,ReactorOnBarracks,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,CallMule,SCV,LandStarportOnTechLab,CloakingField,DoubleMarines,Banshee,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:32 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Stats 11gate 3gate into DT', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'Build starts with an 11 gate. The 11 gate gets out a fast chronoboosted stalker and if your opponent isn't paying attention (most of the time they aren't) you'll be able to kill their scouting probe with the stalker and keep them completely in the dark. With that first stalker you can then easily take watch towers and look around the map to find any other hidden probes they may send out, or even catch the MSCore across the map if they try to scout you that way. The 11gate stalker really gives you a lot ofearly game map control so please use that to its advantage.

The attack itself should go pretty normally. Use the first stalker to poke up a bit after you scout around the map. This will let you know if they expanded early or not. Don't fully commit until you have both stalkers though (especially against double gate openers) since it's pretty easy to get caught out with it. The fact that you're 3gating and that you're making stalkers will really trip your opponent off. The last thing on their mind will be DTs hitting with the next warp in. So be sure to get stalkers instead of zealots. You'll have enough gas even while making stalkers so don't think you won't be able to warp them in with 2 rounds of stalkers.

One tricky thing to deal with is proxy oracle. Since this build skips the MSCore you won't have any defense back at home while you're doing your attack. The key to stopping this is scouting. You need to identify that he's proxying SOMETHING as soon as you can. If you only see one pylon in his base with your probe scout then that's enough. You'll need to deviate your build completely and go purely defensive. The first chronodstalker should be sent to look for the proxy. If you find it early enough you can actually depower the stargate before the oracle gets out. The next thing you need is astargate right when you have 150 gasafter the stalker. You can then get warp get and a 2nd stalker and chrono the 2nd stalker as well. You can decide to send the 2nd stalker to the proxy if you find it quick enough to try and keep it depowered or you can leave it home for extra defense if you don't feel like risking it. When the stargate is done you make a phoenix and chronoboost it and it will finish just as the oracle is coming into your base. If you depower the stargate then that's even better cause you can sometimes even fit in 2 phoenix before the oracle comes out. From there you can either do a 3gate phoenix all in to kill them, or just get 3 phoenix for harassment while getting a robo and expanding. If they go for blink after the oracle (which is pretty common) then you're going to want to do the 3 phoenix and robo response.

If you sniff out them doing a DT opener (1 gate, using all chrono, no signs of pressure at all, maybe find their probe trying to be sneaky and hide a pylon which will be a huge trigger since they opened so passively, see that a robo is finishing up as you start your pressure meaning he went DT/robo etc.) then you need tohide a robo on the map ASAPand also try to target their robo. If you notice it finishing as you start your pressure then you can kill it with the stalkers/DTs before an obs comes out. This is situational though as they may have sentries to FF it or have it tucked away where you can't reach it. If you can't kill the robo then just try to depower it or go straight for probes.

Pretty much any other opener and you'll be able to win with the aggression straight up.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Taeja Autoturret Doom Drop', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

Though it has fallen out of popularity, this once dominant build still remains as powerful as ever. Utilizing a gas first opening to stay safe against an opponents gas first aggression, this build gets a fast two Medivacs to violently drop 8 Marines, 2 Siege Tanks, and 3 Auto Turrets in a critical position of the enemys base.

Scouting

Taeja chooses only to scout with his Hellion, preserving all his SCVs for maximum income. At times, he cannot afford continuous Marine or SCV production in the demonstration replay; had he SCV scouted he would be even more pushed for minerals.

SCV scouting is definitely an option if you do not feel safe enough with the delayed hellion scout, but it should be relegated to a 4:30 scout at the very earliest so as to not delay your Starport in any way.

Transitions

This build can transition into both Bio or Mech. Because you have made no major investments down either tech path, and you have exactly one of each necessary production structure, you can literally go into whatever style you want.

Tips

Against a live resisting opponent, execution of this build may run into some problems. They could be opening banshees; forcing Turrets to be made just before you move out. They could be doing the exact same build, resulting in a base trade. They could be doing earlier aggression that pins you in your base for longer than youd like, such as an elevator attack or a doom drop.

There are reactions to each of these plays, and there are far too many to list here. Regardless of what happens though, sometimes it is important to identify that you are more ahead simply by staying home and defending, and not to blindly commit to the attack every single game. This will come by experience and repeatedly executing the build.

Three main consistencies must be maintained;

1) You MUST continue unit production behind this attack; you cannot start a big transition (adding on Barracks/Factories while freezing production by constructing addons) else you will be extremely vulnerable to a counter attack. The only exception is when you know with certainty that your opponent will not be performing some sort of counterattack (for example, he has gone 3 Barracks into delayed Factory, or he has gone for a elevator and youve already killed the medivacs beforehand).

2) Once your autoturrets are dropped, its almost always a good idea to fly the Raven home; it will prove useful in the mid game.

3) If they made Banshees, you have to make turrets before moving out, else risk losing the game. Delay this to the last possible moment, as you are already pressed for cash.

Pros and Cons

The lethality of this build cannot be understated; you can simply win most games with this drop, especially against players who have gone for more macro oriented builds, such as a Reaper FE or a 15 gas style.

Unfortunately, if your opponent identifies your build quickly enough and prepositions his units properly, or employs defensive AOE such as Tanks or Widow Mines, your drop may end up doing little to no damage, and you can easily die to a counter push or drop.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,SCV,Factory,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Starport,Refinery,SCV,TechLabOnFactory,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,Hellion,SCV,LandStarportOnTechLab,Raven,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,LiftStarportFromTechLab,LandFactoryOnTechLab,SiegeTank,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,Medivac,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SiegeTank,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Medivac,SCV,OrbitalCommand', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:32 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'TLO 2 Base Muta', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with an economic 2 base Muta opener, and uses a 7:20 Overlord scout coupled with the initial Mutalisk harass to determine whether your Terran opponent is using a Bio-based composition, or a Mech-based composition.

Scouting

Scout first with your 2 initial Zerglings, use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of the Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of force very early, you will probably need emergency Spine Crawlers ? your Metabolic Boost will only be finishing around 8:20!
Your next scout will be with an Overlord as soon as your Lair finishes (around 7:05).  With this scout, aim to check if your opponent is playing Mech or Bio. Seeing any of the following can indicate Mech play: an Armory, more than 1 Factory, a Factory with Tech Lab, a lack of Barracks, or a lack of add-ons on Barracks. Seeing any of the following can indicate Bio play: 2 Engineering Bays, a Barracks with a researching Tech lab, more than 1 Barracks, or only one Factory.  If you scout Bio, you can still continue with a 2 base Spire timing and transition into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk OR you can abort the 2 base Spire timing and throw down 2 Evolution Chambers as soon as possible for +1/+1 Melee/Carapace upgrades.
The next scout will be with your initial Mutalisks. Terran will be forced to defend himself with his units, so you?ll see either Bio or Mech units to defend. These Mutalisks should be able to get into his main quite easily and scout what type of production he is using, perhaps even doing some economic damage.

Transitions

If you confirm Mech play with your Mutalisks, throw down an Infestation Pit. If you are sure he is going Mech before your Mutalisks arrive, then you can even place the Infestation Pit as soon as your Mutalisks hatch. Add more bases and Swarm Hosts when you can afford them.  Swarm Hosts are a strong option as your initial Mutalisks will likely force Turrets, Thors, and Widow Mines?units that are generally not strong against Swarm Host play. Alternatively, you can go into Overlord Speed and drop-play, to abuse the lack of Terran mobility. Finally, you can also place your Hive as soon as possible and go for a follow-up Brood Lord transition.
If you confirm Bio play with your Mutalisks, throw down 2 Evolution Chambers and a Baneling Nest as soon as possible. Note that you will be behind in upgrades against a 3 base macro Terran player, but you can recuperate this loss by aiming to snipe a key Tech lab researching Stimpack or Combat Shields, as this can prevent Terran from being aggressive with his upgrade lead. Good creep spread and strong engagements/burrowed Banelings can also mitigate this upgrade deficit. Once you hit the lategame, you have the option to transition into your preferred Hive tech.

Tips

- If you place a 5:00-5:30 Spine Crawler, you should be able to stop Hellions made from a Factory started before your opponent?s 2nd base. A 6:00-6:30 Spine Crawler will finish in time to stop Hellions made after your opponent?s 2nd base or Hellions made after a Reaper opener.
- Just when your Lair finishes (7:20ish), ideally you should be fully saturated on your 2 bases with extra minerals going into additional Drones. However, there are a couple of defensive options available if you are under pressure: If you have extra Drones and want to completely deter Hellion runbys, then make a wall-off with 2 Evolution Chambers and your Spine Crawler at the front of your natural.This will not slow down your Mutalisk timing as long as you remain fully saturated on all mineral lines and Extractors. Alternatively, you also have the ability to make a large group of Zerglings (only if you need to defend yourself) without hurting the timing of the Mutalisks. Note that you should only do this if you absolutely have to because droning should always be a priority. Remember that Metabolic Boost will only finish around 8:20, so any Zerglings made before this point should be used strictly for defense.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against Mech players. The initial Mutalisks will force extra Missile Turrets, Thors, and Widow Mines ? units that are all not ideal against the large mass of Swarm Hosts that you should follow-up with.
If you scout your opponent opening Bio with your Mutalisk timing, then you can transition into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk. The obvious problem here is that you will be behind on upgrades, but again this is not game-ending provided you get strong, cost-efficient engagements on creep. Also, this build is vulnerable to large Marine attacks in the early-game because you will not have Metabolic Boost yet to defend them.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Terminator Oracle into SkyToss', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'It's a very simple opening. You do a normal gate FE and then get 2 gates and a sentry to keep safe vs anything they could possibly throw at you early and then get the stargate with the next 150 gas and make an oracle out of it for any initial drone damage as well as scouting. It isEXTREMELY important you DO NOT lose the oracle. It is more of ascouting unitthan it is a harassing unit in this build. You aren't getting a robo for observers and you aren't getting a high sentry count for hallucinations so the oracle is your only means of map control. If you wanna try being risky with the oracle to snag a few drone kills here or there that you think you might not get away with, then decide against it and keep the oracle alive instead.

After the oracle you go intonon stop void ray production.

Mid game transition/Reations

From the 3rd base you get 2 more stargates and +1 Air to round out your mass void rays. There are a couple things the zerg might do that would require you to do a different response than non stop void ray until like the 20th minute.

Hydra/Ling Pushes

So this is what I think is the most difficult to stop with this exact build. Since it focuses so much on void rays and so little on gateway units it seems it would be a bit awkward to hold hydra/ling. This is why the oracle is so important because you need to identify this is happening as soon as possible. You'll need more zealots and 1 or 2 more sentries. Keep making void rays as much as you can. You might need to only do 1 extra stargate instead of 2 to be able to keep your gateway production up. You can also get extra cannons by your 3rd to help defend. What you want to be doing is segmenting his army up in tiny tiny bite size chunks. Keep as much of his hydra army away from you as possible. Just stall and delay as much as possible until you get a decent void ray/gateway count up and just splitting off chunks of his army. It's a very fragile and patient game that you must play. From there it's best to go into twilight council and storm/charge earlier if he continues to mass hydra. If he goes swarm host after then you can keep going SkyToss.

Burrowed Roaches

This is a style some zergs like to use vs fast 3rds off of a stargate. Since your units are so slow and you don't have as many of them (compared to +2/blink openers) he just masses roaches and burrows them all over your 3 bases and widdles you down. If you notice he's doing this then you're going to needextra cannons in each baseto cover important areas. You should alsobring your oracle home for revelationsince you won't have an observer. Basically if you see it early enough you should be fine since you can spam cannons and void rays.

Roach/Hydra/Viper

This also elicits the faster twilight response. If you notice him rushing to hive after a passive roach hydra opener (or any roach hydra opener really) thenyou NEED HT's to feedback the vipers. If they do the really fast version of this then you won't be at your critical mass of void rays yet and he'll be able to pull them all out of position over top his army. So you just need to transition into charge/HT faster.

Mutas

Simple enough. Scout that he's going spire and make phoenix instead of void rays.

Late Game

So if he's just being passive and letting you do whatever you want (aka making only void rays) be it with either swarm hosts or whatever, then you want to be going around the map with void ray hit squads to try and snipe hatcheries. This is what Protoss used to do back in 2013 when void ray/HT was popular. You go out with your voids and MSCore and try to snipe hatches since they DPS them down so quickly, and then recall back.

If he's being passive you eventually want to still go into twilight for DT harass and storm. If you want to go ahead and mass carriers then by all means go ahead and mass carriers. If you wanna be a little safer and more traditional, then go for faster storm. Just defend, defend, defend and react to any tech switches from zerg and then take the golden fight when you find it. It's a relatively simple game plan, but still fragile if caught out before you get the carriers out. Since you have such a high void ray count though (like 20) then it should deter the zerg from trying to actually engage you.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,GoOutProbe,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Nexus,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Pylon,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Sentry,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Probe,Stargate,Probe,Probe,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Oracle,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Forge,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,VoidRay,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,GroundWeaponsLevel1,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,WarpInSentry,Probe,Probe,Nexus,VoidRay,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,WarpInSentry,WarpInSentry,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,VoidRay,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Stargate,Stargate', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:32 PM;

This is a fun build. Not many people are expecting DT drops anymore so they can do quite the damage to unprepared Terrans and lead you into a nice mid game with the colossus to defend and the warp prism to continue harassment for basically the whole game if you can keep it alive.

The opening is like a normal twilight opening with a 28 TC off of a normal 1 gate FE. There's a proxy pylon after the 2nd stalker to hide the dark shrine to make it easier to surprise the terran. If they get a reaper in or scan you can easily throw a chrono down on the TC to fake going blink. If you want you can warp the first DT in from your proxy pylon and send it across the map and then when your warp prism gets to their base the 2nd warp in will be ready, or you can just do it with the warp prism half way to his base and load it up and once more when you get there, either way it doesn't really matter.

The build also gets an early sentry after 2 stalkers to help defend vs any 3 rax aggression. In the sample video Trap uses a forcefield on the ramp to keep him from going up into the main and keeping him down by the overcharge. Even though he loses like 12 probes, the 3 rax commitment is so strong that your DT's will be able to do equal if not more damage than the 3 rax. This is especially true since they won't have turrets up since they have to delay their ebay for a long time when doing a 3rax. Their SCV count will also be low from the start. So even if you can't defend perfectly at your natural, make sure you can do a lot of damage with the DTs. Keep them alive as long as possible by picking them up out of scans with the warp prism etc.

Trap does a pretty greedy follow up after the DT opening. He goes into 2 forges instead of 2 gateways and gets a later robo bay as well. This is because he knows his DTs will be keeping Reality back so he can tech up like that, however if you want to play it safer then the follow up I provided will be much better for you. It gets the 2 extra gates at 8 minutes as well as the robo bay. A single forge comes slightly earlier. If you notice the terran went for earlier ebays then you can go for double forge. Play as greedy as you would like to.

From there you just make more gates around 9-10 minutes in anticipation for their mid game medivac pressure and take a 3rd base whenever you feel safe with blink and colossus while denying/harassing their 3rd with the warp prism.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,GoOutProbe,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Nexus,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,WarpgateUpgrade,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,TwilightCouncil,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,DarkShrine,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Chronoboost,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,WarpPrism,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,WarpInDarkTemplar,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,RoboticsBay,Probe,Probe,WarpInDarkTemplar,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Forge,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Colossus,ExtendedThermalLance,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,GroundArmorLevel1,Chronoboost,Chronoboost', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:32 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Trap 5 Stalker rush 3 gate', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'This is a really cool flexible and versatile build. You can use it in many situations and have a good response for pretty much anything they could do. As evidence to that point, Trap used this exact same build 4 times in a row vs sOs at Redbull DC and won every time with it.

So the idea behind the build is that you do a 5 stalker rush early on to get maximum map control and pressure potential. After scouting basically everything on your side of the map you turn that control into aggression with a follow up 3 gate attack that hits quite early (~6:40) with an uncommon 8 stalkers. It' packs a much more powerful punch even though it hits slightly later than traditional 3gates due to the fact that it hits with so many stalkers. Most of the times when you go against an early expand build with a 3stalker rush 3gate you'll need the aid of an oracle to really close the deal since they'll be able to get immortals out. However since this hits so powerfully you can get a cancel on the nexus or even end the game. A very cool thing Trap did in game 1 vs sOs on King Sejong is that he went up the ramp with the first 3 stalkers to bait an overcharge from sOs in the main after seeing it was a fast expand. This allowed him free reign over the natural so he could easily kill it. It may not always be that easy but the potential is there.

If they go blink themselves then the hope is that you hit with so many stalkers so early that you can overwhelm them before they can get blink done. However if this isn't possible you should back off and try to expand earlier so you don't die when his blink is done. If they go blink/obs then you should be safe to expand since they won't be able to commit as hard, however if they go 4gate blink you can make a dark shrine instead of blink to kill them. Going for robo after such a late blink like this is risky as you have a huge window to die to a player who just masses only stalkers.

If they go stargate then you should kind of just win. Again, the initial 8 stalkers packs a powerful punch and if you can't end them early then the follow up blink will be a good plan B. Whether it be just to defend a 2nd base easier or to do a follow up all in with blink and 4gates.

If they go DTs you'll need to be able to sniff the build out. If you get a feeling that they might go DTs early then you can get a robo behind the 3gates instead of the twilight council to be safe. Or if you can poke early enough with your first 3 stalkers to get a second look to see if they're going DTs then you can cancel the twilight, make a robo and then warp in sentries at home to block the ramp. You might need to bring your 4th and 5th stalker back to hold position on the ramp as well to buy more time.

If they go for a very fast robo after an expansion you can also proxy a stargate (or just make one in base) after the twilight finishes (don't research blink) or after canceling the twilight. It's a similar response to how you deal with fast expands with thesOs build I did last PvP.Trap nearly kills sOs with the initial 3gate, however gets the stargate anyway which ends up finishing the deal. So even though it's quite late it still does the job well.

Now the other cool thing with this build is that it has a fast expand variant. The build ends up lining up to be very similar to thesafe 2 gate expandthat I covered. The only difference is the double chronod stalkers and that the sentries come last and there's only 2 of them. The nexus and robo go down at identical times. So if you want you can easily learn this build and it'll be perfect in a best of series since you can open with either the aggressive option or defensive option and then switch it around the 2nd game to trick your opponent since it looks identical to them.

This hyper-aggressive 3gate all-in opens with a Gateway on 10 supply in order to get the fastest Warpgate Research possible. It then hits a ridiculously early (@5:30ish) 3gate attack in order to end the game before leaving the early game.

Scouting

This build requires very minimal scouting, for you are placing your initial Gateway at 10 supply?long before any scouting information could influence your build. However, it is critical to send a Probe out to set up proxy Pylon(s) BEFORE your Warpgate is done. Thus, probe scouting to check whether your opponent has opened with a 3 Stalker Rush in order to deny proxy Pylons can yield useful information.

Transitions

This build is an all-in in every respect: getting a 10 Gateway, non-stop chronoboosting Warpgate, halting Probe production at 16 (on minerals), and dumping all money into Gateway units. Thus, there is no well-defined transition. If you are late in your execution and do not outright kill your opponent (or at least take out their army and 10+ Probes), then you will most likely lose the game to any sort of Robotics/Twilight/Stargate counter-attack.

Tips

- Use only 1 Chronoboost on Probes (as you resume Probe production after your 10 Gateway).
- Use 1 Chronoboost on your Zealot in order to finish it as your Cybernetics Core finishes.
- ALL THE REST OF YOUR CHRONOBOOST MUST BE DUMPED INTO WARPGATE RESEARCH. The limiting factor on this build is how fast you can finish Warpgate. Be sure to non-stop chronoboost your Cybernetics Core until it finishes researching so as to attack as early as possible.
- There is a slightly more aggressive/less economic version of this build that opens with a 15 Zealot, 17 Pylon, and never chronoboosts the Zealot. That build and this build can be used interchangeably based on personal preference.
- Place your proxy Pylons quite aggressively for your attack to hit as fast as possible, unless you need to hide your proxy Pylon from a 3 Stalker rushing player.
- Commit to the attack as quickly as possible and never stop warping-in Zealots and Stalkers until either you have won the game or you have lost all of your units. The strength of this all-in is how quickly and ferociously it attacks, but if you are not constantly attacking then your opponent?s economic/tech advantage can destroy you.

Pros and Cons

This build is a hyper-aggressive all-in that is able to get 5 Stalkers and 1 Zealot warped-in at your opponent?s base at 5:30. Because of how quickly this build attacks, it can punish most greedy PvP builds with ease.
Unfortunately, this all-in is quite easy to scout because you cannot hide the fact that you are getting your first Gateway and Cybernetics Core much earlier than the normal timing. However, it being easy to scout and easy to defend are two fundamentally different things, so you can still win with this build quite often.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Pylon,Zealot,Chronoboost,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Stalker,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:32 PM;

This build is cool because it starts out with the most standard all around robo opening possible. So not only is it safe vs basically any opener the Terran can do,it looks totally standardand adds an extra bit of mind games on top of the fake all in. The 2 stalkers will keep you safe vs any sort of early pokes and if you see them doing a gas first opener then you just follow up with your normal response with the robo for observers and what not. I prefer following up with a DT drop after gas first openers, but you can still try to do the build after you defend as well.

The build skips gateways for a while so if he's doing any sort of really crazy aggressive push then you're banking on the immortals and overcharge to keep you alive.Don't be afraid to show the immortalsif you really need them to defend early on, because this build is all about mind games early on so them seeing the immortals is honestly not even that big of a deal because it can force them to go super defensive even earlier than normal which will only benefit you.

The fake attack + Mid game transition

So once warp gate is done you're gonna be warping in only sentries. Trap goes up to 5 which is a good amount where if the Terran sees that many they'll still think you're all inning but not so much that it hinders any chance of transition.

Now one more thing I should note about the push is that there is a vulnerability to 3 rax openings. Since your gate count comes in so late, if you move out on the map with only the first few units and they opened 3 rax then you're probably gonna get caught out and lose. So if you notice they open 3 rax while doing this build, juststart your move out after you warp in the sentries at homeinstead of going across right away. You might even need to defend with the immortals before you can attack if they go soon enough.

The transition is quite simple to pull off if you scare the terran. You get charge and the templar archives right when the twilight council is done andyou also continue making probes the entire timeyou were doing the fake attack. So by the time you're transitioning you'll be fully saturated. The transition is very easily defended because even if the terran doesn't fully buy into your fake attack, if they still try to attack themselves after then the 5 gates worth of units and 2 immortals you made is SO helpful in defending. 5 sentries do wonders to split up small amounts of bio and you should be just fine against any kind of counter pressure if they do it at all. You also get a warp prism after the observer so that if they do try to counter attack then you have a nice 4 zealot drop going on in their main at the same time.

From there just chrono the storm and try your best to keep it a secret. Storm is always great if they don't know about it for as long as possible. You can then come out of no where with 5+ HT's full of energy with them having no idea about it and you just get a free win.

Late game

If you don't get the eZ free win then you can just continue on like with any normal PvT opening. You can make a quick tech over to colossus since he will have identified the HT's late. This gives you extra time to transition over since he'll be setting up to go into anti HT mode for a while. If you can get the 3rd up and get storm out without taking any damage, you should be 100% fine to go into the later stages with a large tech advantage.

Reactions to certain builds

Early gateway attacks

Unlike the phoenix opener, this one deals with gateway timings much easier. The oracle can do more than the phoenix in terms of back stabbing. It really puts the other player on a timer with their attack if you can get good damage done with the oracle. And with 2 extra gates coming in instead of a robo and 1 gate you will be able to defend much easier. In combination with the oracle doing damage you'll only really need to stop 1 or 2 waves of units and you'll be good. Overcharge will help delay and buy time as well.

Stargate openers

This requires some alteration on your part. You can't really go for the original build if you scout them going for stargate. You'll have to either cancel and go for faster blink or go into phoenix like the other build. Your oracle won't be able to do much at all if they go stargate. I prefer going phoenix instead of canceling because if they go oracle then you will shut that down 100% and if they don't then you can do a 3gate phoenix all in and just poop all over them because they don't expect you to all in with phoenix. So I'd suggest reading the sOs phoenix opener as well to help with this area of this build.

DTs

If you sniff out a potential DT opener (no gateway units + no chronoboost + all pylons in base or just seeing the twilight council very early) then you just keep the oracle home and wait for them. If after a while they never come then send it across and just play defensive and macro up and use blink to pressure.

Robo Expand

In this scenario you'll be able to use the oracle for full map control and harassment similar to the phoenix opener. The addition to this build is that you'll have blink to do some light pressure at the front as well. The nexus will be a bit later but you should be able to even the worker count with the oracle and blink. Just be sure not to go overboard with stalkers (just 4-6 is fine) otherwise you'll end up behind and you probably won't be able to break him.

Another thing you can do if you see that it's a robo expand early on, is to just do a 3gate oracle all in skipping twilight. This is a blind counter to robo expands but you'll need to see it early enough and choose your reaction immediately.

Blink

This is the builds biggest weakness. If they go for a straight 3/4gate blink all in then you're basically dead. Not every PvP build is perfect with a reaction to everything. If this happens then there's very little you can do since their blink will be much faster and they will have invested more into stalkers earlier than you. The best you can do is hope your oracle stays alive and to kill enough probes after they move out so that you can slowly edge ahead while you wait for your own blink to finish.

Transition to mid game

Again this is very similar to the sOs phoenix opener. Just get your nexus and a robo/forge to macro up into a normal PvP mid game. Use the oracle and blink to provide light pressure wherever you can fit it.

Something you can do if you see them being greedy is to do a 2 base blink all in. The linked VOD below has Trap doing it vs Has.

When you move out with your first 3 units (Zealot, Stalker, and Mothership Core), go to Zerg s third base and see if you can pick off a queen and force some units. If your opponent reveals that he has Roaches already, then instantly pull back and stay behind your wall until your next poke with the DTs.  Expect a Roach defense vs your Blink Stalkers. If your opponent only shows slow Zerglings, then know that your opponent delayed gas and most likely has a larger economy than normal. Expect a lot more units vs your Blink Stalkers. If your opponent shows Speedlings, then pull back and stay behind your wall until your next poke with the DTs. Expect a Roach/Ling or Hydra/Ling defense vs your Blink Stalkers.

When you send your DTs to each base of your opponent, be on the look out for what units he has to defend, or what tech structures he has built. Your push is just about to happen, so it is too late to react in any way, but it is nice to know what units you will be up against before you are actually fighting them head on.

Transitions

This build is an all-in, so there is no true transition out of it. Simply keep reinforcing with your +2 Blink Stalkers (chronoboost your Gateways when you can) until your opponent is forced to leave or your army gets crushed.

If you do not win, but see that your opponent has way too much Roach or Hydra or Roach/Hydra for you to defeat, consider falling back onto a 3rd Nexus, and starting double Robotics Colossi production as a desperation move.

Tips

- Spend all of your early game chronoboost on your Nexii to maximize Probe production.
- Because you are getting your +1 Attack so early, there is no need to chronoboost it very often. Prioritize Probes instead.
- Do not over commit with your first three units. The Zealot can be killed, but if at all possible, retreat with your Stalker and Mothership Core still alive.
- Hide the Twilight Council (and later Dark Shrine) somewhere in your base that is less likely to be scouted by an Overlord.
- Keep a Probe hidden somewhere on the map before you are ready to move out. Being able to place a nice proxy Pylon for the DTs and then later Stalker warp-ins can be the difference between an easy win and a tough loss.
- Obviously, during the fight itself, utilize Blink to save the weakest Stalkers and keep your army alive.

Pros and Cons

This build is a solid all-in that utilizes everything the Twilight Council has to offer. It is a 1-2-3 punch sort of build, first hitting with your initial 3 units, then the DTs, and then the Blink Stalkers, so it keeps Zergs on their toes.

However, because this build is so reliant on the Twilight Council, your opponent flying in an overlord and spotting this will tip them off to everything that you are building; it is very easy to scout (Note: just because it is easy to scout does NOT mean it is easy to defend). Also, it is an all-in, so assuming you do not succeed in crushing your opponent with the Blink Stalkers, there is very little chance you have of coming back into the game. Finally, because this build packs a 1-2-3 punch, it is a more mechanically difficult build than other choices and is not suggested for newer players.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,GoOutProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Nexus,Forge,Pylon,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Chronoboost,PhotonCanon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,GroundWeaponsLevel1,Zealot,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,MothershipCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Stalker,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,TwilightCouncil,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Blink,DarkShrine,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,GroundWeaponsLevel2,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInDarkTemplar,WarpInDarkTemplar,WarpInDarkTemplar,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:33 PM;

This Reaper FE opens with a strong economy, and then transitions into constant harass with a Widow Mine drop follow-up.

Scouting

This build is reasonably safe against most your opponent can open with as long as you are smart with your two Reapers.  Use them for scouting by poking at your opponents front in order to determine what your opponent can or cannot be doing as well as potentially killing a Marine or SCV.  Against Reaper play, keep your Reapers more defensively positioned.

Transitions

This build can transition into Marine/Tank or Mech very easily. However you cannot transition into Bio/Hellbat because you have not invested any time into getting the early game Bio upgrades.

When transitioning into Marine/Tank, start your tank production soon, using the Widow Mines and Reapers to stay safe as well as apply pressure. As your Medivac is moving out, swap your Barracks onto the Factorys Reactor and start double Marine production, add on a Tech lab onto your Factory to start Siege Tank production, and build two more Barracks and a third Refinery as soon as you can afford it to complete your 2 base infrastructure.

When transitioning into Mech, again you must rely on the Widow Mines and Reapers to stay safe and apply pressure, but this time back at home you must be playing greedily. You can dump your money into a 3rd base while your Medivac is moving out. Once youve started 3 bases, getting 2 more Factories, all your Refineries, and a decent Siege Tank count is your obvious next move. YoDa likes to also make a Tech lab on his Starport to get Ravens, but this is a stylistic choice that you dont have to make.

Pros and Cons

This build is great because it gives you a good economy and gives you lots of map control with the early game Reapers/Widow Mines. The harass you can apply is incredibly effective if you split up your Widow Mines effectively throughout your opponents base.

However, it is somewhat vulnerable to Banshee play, so be sure to position your Widow Mines defensively against Banshees. Also, with poor Medivac control, you can very easily lose your Medivac and all the Widow Mines if you fly directly into a Viking or Marine pack. Be sure to prioritize keeping the Medivac alive above all else.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Zest 11gate stargate', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'Build lines up VERY tightly. This build comes down to the gas count. You save up a lot of chrono early on to let the build flow and so that way you can chrono each phoenix as they start. By the time each chronod phoenix is finished you will have exactly 100 gas to start the next phoenix. After 4 chronod phoenix you will then have exactly 100 gas to start the robo and then 300 minerals left over for 2 gateways. If you do it perfectly, then you'll know when because it is very exact.

The idea is to get a RIDICULOUSLY fast stargate for phoenix to be able to scout exactly what your opponent is doing, and easily defend said thing that your opponent is doing. The build relies on the early phoenix and MSCore to keep you safe, however of course you'll need to do some adaptations to hold off certain styles. However the main premise behind the build is to set up a nice early game with easy scouting and an easy transition into the mid game with harass potential that normally would not be available.

Now this build is obviously a complete hard counter to normal stargate openers. Your stargate is much faster than theirs so you can easily prepare for an oracle and you will always be ahead in the phoenix count. This pretty much forces them to either do a all in with stargate tech that you can easily poop all over, or go into delayed blink. This is then easily prevented with a robo for immortals as shown in Zest's game vs Trap. If it's an all in, then collect your free win. If not then just proceed into a normal macro game.

If you play vs someone going straight to blink, then a very similar response will be made. Again, the advantage to this build is that you will 100% see what they are doing so you can have enough time to prepare. Upon seeing the fast twilight for blink, (make sure it is blink instead of DTs. This can be determined by the gate count, the stalker count (or lack there of) and other timings from the early build.) you will stop at 2 or 3 phoenix and instantly throw down your robo and extra gates. You'll have to stay on 1 base for some time since it you obviously can't expand vs a 1 base all in. However this response is extremely similar to how you would deal with blink using the old HerO phoenix opener from WoL. In HotS now, the difference is that you have an early MSCore for overcharge and you can transition into the power house immortal/void ray composition that MC has shown to be quite effective.

Vs. DT's it's pretty obvious. You scout it early (because you can) and then make an oracle or very fast robo for detection and continue to expand like normal.

Vs. greedier expands you just take advantage of your early phoenix to harass him while getting your own expansion up and getting even through your phoenix harassment.

The hard part comes with 3gates/4gates and the like. Now I'm not 100% sure of how to deal with this perfectly yet, however the best idea I (and FlatLine) could come up with is relying on the early overcharge (the reason you get the fast MSCore) and phoenix to lift units within range of the overcharge.

Scouting

In the early stages of the game, all scouting comes from Overlord vision, so be sure that you send your initial 2 Overlords towards your opponent?s natural expansion. You can use your Overlord to compare his Hatchery?s HP to yours, to determine what kind of opener he used. If his hatchery is stronger than yours, he has gone hatchery first. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is the same HP as yours, he has VERY LIKELY done the same build as you. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is weaker to yours, he has gone for a gas and pool before hatchery in some order, meaning his speed is quicker than yours. Banelings before speed in this scenario is often advised, and likely make the Baneling nest in the main to not lose your Baneling tech to mass Zerglings with speed. An alternative is to not use your Gas, and get extra Queens and 2-3 Spine Crawlers. The main theme here is to not get Speed first, as his WILL be quicker. You need to find an edge that isn?t using Zergling Speed.
When playing versus any very early aggression (<10 pool), use your Drones to defend until you have your own Zerglings, a Queen, and potentially a Spine Crawler. Consider canceling the Hatchery for more minerals. Also use your initial overlord to scout when your opponent is taking their natural Hatchery. Feel free to apply some light pressure with your first Zerglings against a Hatch first build, but do not let it mess up your macro.
Make sure you have 2 to 4 Zerglings out on the map at all times. Send your initial 2 Zerglings to your opponent?s base to spot what they have at the front, and if possible get into the main with 1 Ling to see whether your hatching Drones or Zerglings from their eggs. Use the scouting intel that these pokes give you to determine whether you should get Banelings and extra Zerglings to defend yourself or pressure your opponent, or whether you should continue droning.
If your scout Zerglings see Drones hatching, and no wall at the front, you can choose to make Drones OR Zerglings to pressure. If you scout Zerglings, and no wall at the front, you should make the same amount of Zerglings. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings escape, send them back in to scout in 20~ seconds. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings die, remake the scout. Consider another 2 Zerglings for just-in-case Banelings. If you scout a wall, the Zerg is likely playing passive and you are likely safe.
As soon as you are sure you are safe, transition into your choice of tech.

Transitions

This has best synergy with a Hydralisk transition, which is possible after taking gas numbers 5 and 6 at your third base, although you could flood earlier Speedlings with +1 Carapace. However, you have the option of simply researching +1 Melee upgrades to transition into upgraded Speedlings, which is excellent against Mutalisk openers, or even going for a delayed Spire.

Tips

If your opponent is also going for a Roach based composition, remember that Roach Battles are mostly determined by macro and concaves. The superior concave will allow a smaller force to defeat a larger one, for the most part ? this is because more Roaches can fight in a larger concave, although you can also rush forward to allow the ones in the back to attack.
Against a Mutalisk based player, be sure to scout to see how many Mutalisks your opponent is making. If he is only making a few Mutalisks to dictate the pace of the game and force spores, you will probably be able to get away with only making Queens and Spores. If your opponent is heavily committing to Mutalisks, then consider incorporating Hydralisks and Infestors earlier than you normally would, in addition to the standard Queens and Spores. Spore Crawlers should also be placed to cover your Extractors, to ensure you do not fall behind tech wise. Do not be afraid to delay your Roach Timing if you are not sure how your opponent is going to play it out.
Against an upgraded Speedling force, delay your timing until you are maxed out. If your opponent invests very heavily into melee and carapace upgrades, they are almost certainly transitioning into an Ultralisk focused composition.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very flexible opener, which can combat greedier defensive play and also more aggressive play if your defensive micro is strong.
Because you are opening +1 Carapace Speedlings, taking and defending your third should relatively straightforward. Additionally, you have the opportunity of being reactive; the infrastructure you have at Lair level (+1 Carapace, Roach Warren, Metabolic Boost) allow you to choose between +1/+1 Speedlings, +1+1 Roaches, or even a slightly delayed Mutalisk transition.
However, this build by default will skip the Baneling nest in favor of faster upgrades and Lair Tech, so it is important to be on point with your scouting to avoid dying to enemy Baneling/Speedling aggression. If your scouting is poor, consider opening instead with the Safe Ling/Bling Opener, which will teach you what to look for and give you the tools to defend with.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Overlord,Extractor,Drone,Queen,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Queen,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,EvolutionChamber,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GroundCarapaceLevel1,Hatchery,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Lair,InjectLarva,RoachWarren,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Extractor,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GlialReconstitution,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:23:33 PM;

From the point it leaves off its up to you to decide what you want to do. You can go into twilight tech for immortal/archon to do a +2 timing or go into passive colossus play.

Like the name suggests, the opening is extremely safe and versatile. Early aggression is completely thwarted with this build as you get an early Sentry and MSCore to defend proxy oracles or gateway pressure. The 4 extra units that you get out of the gateways before expanding really deny any sort of early 3 or 4gate attacks while the MSCore defends vs phoenix and oracle play. The only thing youll need to be careful with is DT openers since the robo is a little bit late compared to other builds. You should be able to get an idea that DTs will be coming though after seeing little to no unit production with your probe scout and maybe even the twilight council if youre diligent enough. In that case you can get the robo before your nexus if you want to be safe, however with 2 forcefields and stalkers to block the ramp you should be able to stall until your observer is out.

Make sure you remember to use your hallucination scout at 6 minutes to know exactly what youre up against. If you see them playing passively you can skip a 3rd gate and get a much faster forge to be ahead on them in upgrades. You also dont need to warp in anything when WG is done if you see them playing passively, it would just be a waste of resources that dont do anything.

VortiX uses a gasless opening and transitions into a strong Roach Zergling timing, aiming to punish greedier Roach play or swift Mutalisk play.

Scouting

n the early stages of the game, all scouting comes from Overlord vision, so be sure that you send your initial 2 Overlords towards your opponent?s natural expansion. You can use your Overlord to compare his Hatchery?s HP to yours, to determine what kind of opener he used. If his hatchery is stronger than yours, he has gone hatchery first. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is the same HP as yours, he has VERY LIKELY done the same build as you. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is weaker to yours, he has gone for a gas and pool before hatchery in some order, meaning his speed is quicker than yours. Banelings before speed in this scenario is often advised, and likely make the Baneling nest in the main to not lose your Baneling tech to mass Zerglings with speed. An alternative is to not use your Gas, and get extra Queens and 2-3 Spine Crawlers. The main theme here is to not get Speed first, as his WILL be quicker. You need to find an edge that isn?t using Zergling Speed.
When playing versus any very early aggression (<10 pool), use your Drones to defend until you have your own Zerglings, a Queen, and potentially a Spine Crawler. Consider canceling the Hatchery for more minerals. Also use your initial overlord to scout when your opponent is taking their natural Hatchery. Feel free to apply some light pressure with your first Zerglings against a Hatch first build, but do not let it mess up your macro.
Make sure you have 2 to 4 Zerglings out on the map at all times. Send your initial 2 Zerglings to your opponent?s base to spot what they have at the front, and if possible get into the main with 1 Ling to see whether your hatching Drones or Zerglings from their eggs. Use the scouting intel that these pokes give you to determine whether you should get Banelings and extra Zerglings to defend yourself or pressure your opponent, or whether you should continue droning.
If your scout Zerglings see Drones hatching, and no wall at the front, you can choose to make Drones OR Zerglings to pressure. If you scout Zerglings, and no wall at the front, you should make the same amount of Zerglings. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings escape, send them back in to scout in 20~ seconds. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings die, remake the scout. Consider another 2 Zerglings for just-in-case Banelings. If you scout a wall, the Zerg is likely playing passive and you are likely safe.
As soon as you are sure you are safe, transition into your choice of tech.

Transitions

However, because you have not yet committed upgrades to either Ranged or Melee, you can choose between transitioning into Roach Hydra or Ling Ultra.
If you do choose to go for Roaches, immediately research Roach Speed and take your third, while droning as heavily as you can without endangering yourself. You can transition to a similar midgame to that of Vortix?s 3 Base Speed Roach, albeit without the fast upgrades.
It is not recommended you go for a Mutalisk transition.

Tips

Aim to focus down Queens with transfuse energy first, and use Roaches to tank any Baneling hits. Emphasize surrounds with your Speedlings and tank Banelings with your Roaches.

Pros and Cons

This build excels and punishing either greedier Roach players, and players rushing for Mutalisks. If it fails, you are behind as with any timing attack. You do not have any tech, you have no upgrades, and you will almost certainly be behind in drones. Additionally, because you are opening gasless, your defense is likely to be much more difficult. You will have no Banelings or Zergling speed, so your defense will revolve entirely around Spine Crawlers, Queens, and building placement.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Queen,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Drone,RoachWarren,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Extractor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,SpawnCreepTumor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,SpawnCreepTumor,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,SpawnCreepTumor', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:26:50 PM;

This mass Reaper build order gets 2 Reactored Barracks cranking out 4 Reapers at a time in order to overwhelm your opponent with purely mass Reaper.

Scouting

There is minimal SCV scouting with this build because you will open the same regardless of what your opponent is making. The majority of your scouting comes from your constant Reaper attacks.

Against anything but Banshees, constantly produce Reapers to overwhelm your opponent. Against Banshees, be sure to cancel your Reaper production and start producing 4 Marines at a time. If you have done significant economic damage, then getting an Engineering Bay for a Missile Turret is not a bad idea either.

Transitions

This build actually transitions pretty well into a decent midgame for being an all-in. However, you can only transition into Bio after opening with this build because it is hard to utilize your quick Reactors and two Barracks early on if you are trying to transition into Mech. When you feel like you cannot do any more damage with your Reapers, be sure to stop Reaper production and begin your Bio upgrades.

For a standard Bio follow-up, get your natural expansion, start Marine production, and get a 3rd Barracks with a Tech lab. This way you can start Stimpack, an Engineering Bay, Factory, and 3rd Refinery all at the same time just like as if you had opened with a normal 1rax FE into Medivacs.

For a fast upgrade transition, start your natural expansion, Marine production from the 2 Barracks, 2 Engineering Bays, and then +1/+1. As soon as you can, get one more Barracks with a Tech lab so that you can start researching Stimpack. Then, you can take your third Refinery and get a Factory to go into Reactored Medivacs and +2/+2.

For a follow-up timing attack, start your natural expansion, Marine production, and a Factory instantly.  Get a Tech lab on the Factory and start Siege Tank production in order to hit a very fast Marine/Tank push with your second Siege Tank. Behind this contain/attack, you can get your 3rd base, 3rd and 4th Refineries, double Engineering Bays, and 2 or 3 more Barracks (get Stimpack and Combat Shields).

Execution

As soon as your first Reapers pop, start being aggressive. Your number one goal is to deny your opponents Factory for as long as possible (Hellions or Widow Mines can be difficult to maneuver around), but in order to do this, you have to be in your opponents face with your Reapers as soon as they are built. Also, with your constant harass, be sure to dwindle your opponents Marine count without committing too hard and losing any Reapers.

Your Reaper count increases very quickly, and when you get around 6 to 8 Reapers, you can truly overwhelm most units your opponent can have.  Thus, focus on killing his army with your initial Reapersyou will be able to kill his SCVs once his army is dead.

In general, if your opponent sees what you are doing, you are in trouble.  Thus, it is suggested that at least one of your Barracks is build outside your base (even just at your natural will sometimes work fine). However, you can proxy both Barracks outside your main to make this build a little more all-in too. This also works for some mind games because if your opponent scouts you with a Refinery but no Barracks in your main, he will most likely try to defend proxy Marauders (a defense that is awful on most maps against mass Reaper).

Pros and Cons

This build is very aggressive and can catch many opponents off-guard.  With a hilarious amount of Reapers, you are usually able to overwhelm their army within the first 8 minutes. However, even if the all-in does fail, it can still transition into a 11-12 minute Bio+Stimpack/Medivac timing.

However, if you do not do much damage, you will be quite behind your opponent in tech (and possibly income). Also, this build can be easily scouted if an SCV sees both Reactors building before a single unit, so at least one of the Barracks must be proxied outside of your main.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Refinery,OrbitalCommand,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,DoubleReapers,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleReapers,SCV,DoubleReapers,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleReapers,DoubleReapers,CallMule,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:26:51 PM;

This build opens with 2 Barracks to produce a lot of Reapers very quickly.  It is a great way to get complete map control with 4 Reapers, apply heavy pressure to an expanding opponent, and transition into standard Bio play.  This 2rax Reaper build also can instantly win against some Gas First or CC First builds.

Scouting

This build is a reasonably safe build against most things Terran can open with as long as you are smart with your initial four Reapers. Thus, SCV scouting early on is not required or even suggested. Use your Reapers to take map control and pick off Marines/scout the front. However, there may come a time when your opponent has a Bunker up and you can no longer poke the front. Then, while prioritizing keeping your Reapers alive over all else, jump into his base and pick off SCVs/continue to scout.

If you scout your opponent opening Banshee, then cease Reaper productioninstead, favor making Marines and getting an earlier Engineering Bay. If you scout a Widow Mine Drop, then be wary of your opponents Medivac, and hole up in your main base until you have enough units to stabilize. If you scout a Marine/Tank/Banshee all-in, then keep your 2nd Command Center in your main base and play defensive. If you scout a 1rax FE, then scout for the Bio or Mech follow-up, and apply pressure whenever possible.

Note: If you scout your opponent going Mech, then add a 2nd Tech lab instead of Reactor on your initial Barracks and build some marauders too.  You can still follow the same basic build order, but you will have a little less gas than normal, so you might need to get early gas geysers than what is written up above.

Transitions

This build commits too much into Infantry upgrades for you to transition into Mech. However, it transitions quite smoothly into Marine/Tank or pure Bio (vs Mech).

For a Marine/Tank transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory for Siege Tank production, take your third base, start your 4th-6th gas geysers, and start another Engineering Bay+Armory for more upgrades. With your midgame push, confirm what unit composition your opponent is going, and play aggressively/passively accordingly.

For a pure Bio transition (if your opponent is playing Mech), start another Engineering Bay and Armory to continue your upgrades as you take your 3rd Command Center and keep your opponent pinned back. Threaten boosted Medivac drops whenever possible, but do not over commit your army if your opponent has an adequate defense.

Pros and Cons

This build is a safe build that also opens aggressively. With this build, you can pick off Marines and SCV, while simultaneously getting a full scout of your opponents base and stressing their multitasking. This build also has a heavy Marine follow up, and can deal with Banshees or 1/1/1 all-ins rather well due to the Reactor/Tech lab first. This transitions into normal Bio play but gives you the advantage due to early harass and map control.

However, this build performs poorly against early Hellion openings. If you scout Reactored Hellions, cease Reaper production instantly and transition into faster Marine/Marauder production. Also, if your opponent holds the Reapers cost-effectively with a 1rax FE or CC First (either due to you mis-microing, or them having a solid defense), then you will be behind going into the midgame economically.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,Barracks,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Reaper,SCV,SCV,Reaper,Reaper,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Barracks,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,CallMule,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,Marine,CombatShield,SCV,Marine,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Refinery,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,Factory,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,EngineeringBay,StimPack,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SCV,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,CallMule,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marine,CallMule,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,LiftFactoryFromReactor,TechLabOnFactory,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:26:57 PM;

This 1rax FE build gives you a strong economy, while staying safe from early Protoss pressure. It then transitions into a strong 10 minute push with +1 attack, Stim, Combat Shields, Concussive shells, and 2 Medivacs.

Scouting

When you send your scouting SCVs, you want to look for gasses, nexus energy, and the units he is producing out of his gateway. If he only has 1 gas before his stalker pops, check to see whether your opponent gets his natural at around 5:15 (You can hide your SCV nearby and then run it in around 5:30) to check for an expansion later if need be. If he has 2 gas and you don?t scout an expansion by 6:00, then be wary of an all-in. The common responses to standard Protoss plays are:
- Nexus First: Bunker rush with 4 Barracks instead of getting your 2nd CC OR Stop making marines at 3, get your 3rd CC and go straight into double upgrades to get a leg up in the macro game.
- Double Gas, No Expansion by 6:00: Get 3 bunkers (and a missile turret if you haven?t ruled out DTs). Pull SCVs to repair and provide a meat shield as necessary.
- 1 Gate Expand: Play normal.

Tips

- To confirm that your opponent is not allining you, have an SCV (or scan) go to his natural just before the 6 minute mark. A 4gate will hit before this timing, but 1 bunker and repair should be able to hold a 4gate easily enough; all other scary allins hit much later and this scout will give you enough time to prepare an appropriate defense.
- Unless you are expecting an allin of some sort, do not make marauders until you?ve started your starport. The 50 gas from making 2 marauders at a time will slow down the push by over a minute.
- Also related to this, you can push your medivac timing earlier by getting your factory before your barracks addons. Because you?re not making marauders just yet anyway, the only difference between getting the addons before factory vs getting them after is that you cut a couple of marines and get a faster medivac timing. Both versions are totally valid.
- Once you have your first marauder out, take your own watchtower by scaring away or killing his stalker ? up until you get a marauder out, you have to stay behind your bunker for defense.
- When you attack with your first 2 medivacs, be sure to scan your opponent?s natural in order to determine how much stuff/how many sentries he has waiting for you. If your opponent has too many units, then double drop the main instead of attacking directly into the natural.  Do NOT engage in chokes against sentries.

Transitions

As you?re pushing out, you will need to place down your 3rd CC, 2nd engibay and armory, 2 more rax, and a ghost academy or 2nd starport to counter your opponent?s HTs or collosi. If you?re feeling safe, then place down the 3rd CC and engibay first. If you?re worried about not having enough units, get the 2 more rax earlier, as well as possibly your ghost academy or 2nd starport before 3rd. Transition into 3 base bio with ghosts/vikings when you have the money.

Pros and Cons

This is probably the most standard 1rax FE. Compared to the other variants, it gives you reasonably timed infrastructure, a very safe opening against most 1 base and early 2 base Protoss all-ins, and of course the exact same economy as the other 1rax FEs.  However, early on you have no map control at all because of how well early stalkers can deal with naked marines in the open field; you don?t get up your 3rd CC extremely fast; and you don?t get up your 5 barracks up as quickly as Bomber?s build.
Other TvP builds, besides the 1rax FE variants, should also be considered. This build gives you a lot smaller army and much later upgrades than MKP?s 2rax early on, in exchange for a much stronger economy and a solid timing attack with Medivacs at around the 10 minute mark. Also, it gives you more scans and SCVs to pull to deal with early DTs and/or pressure. While the 2rax will attack early and hit hard with continued aggression, the 1rax FE will give you a much more powerful attack later on, in exchange for leaving you more vulnerable against the early aggression Protoss can lay on.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,CommandCenter,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,Bunker,Marine,SCV,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Refinery,Refinery,SCV,Marine,CallMule,Marine,Marine,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,Marine,SCV,SCV,Marine,SupplyDepot,StimPack,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Marine,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Factory,EngineeringBay,Refinery,Marine,Marine,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,CombatShield,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Marauder', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:27:00 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '3 gate sentry pressure into DT', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'So this build starts off with a gate expand so as to get out a good sentry count early so you can do some 3gate sentry pressure to force some extra units out of zerg and keep them scared from the beginning. 1 gate FEs are known to make the game kinda crazy and throw the zerg off sometimes and this is exactly what this build is meant to do. The cool thing is that you don't even need to pressure with the units. You can, but really all you need to do is show that you have some sentries and zealots coming their way, send a hallucinationto scout and then stay at a watch tower and fake them into over reacting while you take a 3rd and tech to this wonderful thing called the Dark Shrine.

Now these aren't meant to be the fastest DTs in the world by any means, but they hit at such an awkward time that the zerg really shouldn't be expecting (especially after seeing a 3gate sentry pressure opening). So they have a chance to do quite a good deal of damage. Also, if they commit to a counter attack with the early units you forced out of them the DTs will do much more damage and you will also have your robo pumping out immortals at home to defend any roach follow ups that could happen.

After your cheeky DTs do their job you can saturate your 3rd and go up to +2/blink/immortal for a strong 3 base timing a few minutes after the DTs hit that can outright end the game if they aren't prepared or took too much damage from the DTs.

The high sentry count early on also makes it so you can throw out non stop hallucinations to really see what the zerg is up to an what tech they're choosing. If you see swarm hosts you of course need to throw down a robo bay and 2nd robo instead of doing the immortal +2 follow up otherwise you own't be ale to bust them. Mutas can also be dealt with via base trade quite well (so long as you identify it quickly enough and can hit while they're in production and you leave some cannons at your 3rd).

If they go for a high hydra count and it doesn't seem like your +2 blink immortal follow up can kill them then you can go into some form of splash damage while taking a 4th and just harassing them a bit to keep him away from your 4th and buy time for said splash damage.

This micro-intensive build rushes for a proxy Stargate, and then pumps out Oracles to do damage to your opponent?s mineral line while simultaneously crushing through your opponent?s front with a strong Gateway+Mothership Core army.

Attack your opponent?s main mineral line with 1st Oracle as soon as it finishes (@6:15ish), and push at front with Zealot/Stalker/Mothership Core.

Scouting

This build is an all-in that makes a lot of units, so is safe in general vs an aggressive opponent ? the only scouting you need to do is spot where your opponent has spawned and whether or not they have taken gas. If you are performing this build vs a gasless Terran, you can be much more aggressive with your initial 3 units and oracle. Versus a gassing Terran, you must be wary of Widow Mines, so be sure not to clump up your units when pushing up ramps or going into your opponent?s mineral line with your Oracles.

Transitions

This build is an all-in, so note that there is no clear transition out of it.  Continue making oracles (up to 3 or 4) and warping in Stalkers so that you can break the front. Note that if your opponent does eventually hold and you end up losing your entire army, then you are most likely behind both economically and in tech. Only expand and continue producing Probes once/if you break the front and you are just making sure that you have enough economy to follow up with a win.

Pros and Cons

This build hits very early with a proxied Oracle, taking advantage of the weakness of early game Marines without upgrades. This build is so strong because it gives you enough units to pressure both your opponent?s front and their mineral line simultaneously. It also then gives you the infrastructure needed to warp-in enough Gateway units to eventually bust down your opponent?s front.

However, this build is a very micro intensive build ? you must be target firing with your Oracle in the main, while not losing any of the units in the front, usually for at least 3 minutes. It is also weak vs Widow Mines if you have poor control. Lastly, note that this build is in fact an all-in, so doing some damage but losing your entire army does put you behind by quite a bit.

Tips

- Chronoboost your initial Stalker so that you deny scouting from your opponent as soon as possible.
- Do not get your initial Probe trapped in your opponent?s base or killed, for that will force you to send another Probe to build the proxy Pylon and lose more mining time.
- You have to target fire individual SCVs for the Pulsar Beam to be most effective.
- One Oracle can take down 4 Marines if it has enough energy for Pulsar Beam the entire time.
- You can use the Oracle?s Envision spell for mobile detection in case your opponent has opened Widow Mine or Banshee.
- Be wary of Widow Mines both in the front or in the main mineral line and stay alert of the 40 second cooldown they have between shots.
- Don?t forget to use the Mothership Core?s Time Warp ability to help vs SCVs/marines in the attack at the front.
- Once/if you break the front, be sure to build an expansion and resume Probe production just in case your opponent does eventually hold.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,GoOutProbe,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Probe,Zealot,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Chronoboost,Pylon,Stargate,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Oracle,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Oracle,Chronoboost,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Oracle,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:27:01 PM;

This build appears to be a standard Zerg opener to the untrained eye, but it actually can outright kill most unrefined Terran macro builds in the lower leagues.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. Do your best to stop your opponent from scouting how many Zerglings you are creating. The rest of your scouting will come from your Speedling timing attack. Check whether your opponent is going for a Bio, Mech, or 3CC play. You should at the least be able to force your opponent to lift off their natural unless they made a tight wall ? don?t commit your Speedlings into a meat grinder if your opponent has walled off successfully.

Transitions

As soon as you hit your attack, you need to be droning quite heavily to be able to stand any sort of chance going into the midgame. Only put Drones back in gas and re-begin teching up to Lair, Evolution Chambers, and Mutalisks once you are getting closer to 2 base Drone saturation.

Tips

- Be sure that you take map control with your initial Zerglings. Being able to deny your opponent vision of your building Zerglings will make this attack that much stronger.
- Do NOT attack into a Terran force behind a full wall-off. Force your opponent to abandon their natural and continue droning up.

Pros and Cons

This build looks like a standard ZvT build, but hits your opponent incredibly aggressively with a lot of early game Speedlings. This Speedling timing should either outright win the game or give you an effective economic advantage that will take you into the midgame. However, because you are cutting Drone production in order to support this swell of Zerglings, your economic situation will be much further behind than what you might be used to.

This classic 7 Roach Rush all-in is a great build for newer players to learn one base macro with. It hits a very quick timing that can crush through inexperienced or unsuspecting opponents.

Scouting

This build can be performed against any opener Terran has. The only scouting you need to do is send your initial 2 Overlords to your opponent?s base in order to spot both where your opponent is spawned and whether or not they have a Bunker or Marauders that you will have to break down or fight.

Transitions

This 7 Roach Rush build is a strong 1 base attack that opens with a lot of units and few Drones, so your follow-up will be very slow. That being said, you should start to float some minerals as you are reaching your opponent?s base, so start a natural Hatchery, build a lot more Drones, and get Metabolic Boost as soon as possible. Going for a Lair and getting a Banelings Nest in order to start a Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk composition is a strong way to deal with Terran in the midgame.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong 1 base attack that can crush your opponent early before they have their midgame even established. However, this build can be held off if your opponent scouts it and prepares with a repaired Bunker or Marauders if they have opened with a 1 base play of their own. It also is much less economical than any Hatchery First openers.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Queen,Zergling,RoachWarren,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:27:01 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '15 gas FE into Mine Drop to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reactored Rax FE gives you enough Marines to stay safe against early Protoss pressure, while still getting a fast expansion. Then it transitions into a fast Marine/Widow Mine drop to hit your opponent with some pressure of your own. Interestingly, this build can also transition into standard Bio play or macro Mech play.

Scouting

This build is largely safe against any early pressure that Protoss can apply because it gives you a Reactored Barracks to pump out Marines two at a time. Also, if you are feeling unsafe, you have the minerals after your reactor finishes to place down a Bunker at your natural. Also, if your opponent is doing a 1 base all-in, then instead of being aggressive with your Marines/Widow Mines, you can keep them in your main and defend your Bunker/main. By simply constantly producing Widow Mines, Marines, and Medivacs to keep replenishing your defenses, you can remain safe against most all-ins. However seeing the all-ins coming is crucial. Scouting your opponents natural expansion timing with an SCV is huge (if your opponent does not have an expansion started by around 5:30, expect an all-in). Besides seeing an all-in coming, the rest of your midgame scouting will come from seeing how your opponent defends the Widow Mine drop.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because it gets a good economy, but also enough Marines to defend early game Protoss pokes. Then, the Marine/Widow Mine drop gives you complete map control AND keeps your opponent in the dark as to what followup you are doing (Mech/Bio/3CC). Not to mention that if your opponent is not careful, this build can get Widow Mines in your opponents mineral lines and land some huge hits on Probes, essentially winning the game instantly.

However, this build is more vulnerable to later all-ins such as Void ray or Blink+Mothership core all-ins than more standard bio play (because you will not have stim yet), so be sure to position your Widow Mines defensively and add on more bunkers against a Protoss that you have scouted isnt expanding. Also, with poor Medivac control, you can very easily lose your Medivac and all the Widow Mines if you are not careful. Lastly, this build is not quite as economical as a 1rax FE build, but it still gets a pretty reasonably fast expand, so its not too far behind a 1rax FE build in terms of economy at all.

Tips

- Early game Stalker/Mothership Core pressure may be hard to deal with, but position your Marines effectively and hold on until you get out a Widow Mine in order to defend your base.
- Once you have pinned your opponent on an aggressive build (for instance, by scouting a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), do NOT move out; instead, posture your Widow Mines and Marines in an appropriately defensive position.
- Oracles flat out destroy marines, so if you are fighting an opponent going for Stargate, position your Widow Mines by the mineral line and even consider getting out one turret per base.
- When committing to an attack, boost in and drop one Widow Mine at your opponents main-to-natural ramp in order to trap his army on one half of his base. Once you have his ramp locked down, you will have several seconds of complete control of the half of his base where his army is not located. Use these seconds to kill workers and/or position a mine in a crucial location.
- Above all else, the strength of this build is non-stop harass/pressure.  Do NOT lose your Medivac or your entire map control will disappear.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SupplyDepot,SCV,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Factory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,Bunker,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SCV,Starport,WidowMine,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,WidowMine,SupplyDepot,Medivac,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Refinery,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,EngineeringBay,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,TechLabOnFactory,ReactorOnStarport,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,Refinery,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,CallMule,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,LandRaxOnTechLab,StimPack,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,LandRaxOnTechLab,SupplyDepot,DoubleMedivacs,Refinery,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMedivacs,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CombatShield,CallMule,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMedivacs,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,SupplyDepot,InfantryArmorLevel1', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:27:02 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '8-8-8 Proxy Reaper', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This all-in gets the fastest possible Reaper with which to do damage against your opponent. It then follows up with another Barracks so that you can make enough Reapers to overwhelm your opponent and outright win the game before it has even begun.

Scouting

You will be doing this build no matter what, so there is no SCV scouting.  The rest of your scouting will come from your Reapers seeing what your opponent has. However, an interesting SCV timing to note: you will reach a very nice proxy location with your SCV on most 2 person maps if you send it out exactly as you get 50 minerals for the first time at 8 supply.

Transitions

There is no defined transition from this build; it is basically all-in after all.  However, if your opponent goes for very quick roaches then you might want to add-on Tech labs and get Marauders. Besides that, you should have enough Reapers to evenly trade with anything your opponent can make, as long as you can stutter step appropriately.

Tips

- Do NOT lose any of your first 3 Reapers. They are the most important part of this build  applying the early pressure, forcing Drones to be pulled, and most importantly stopping Queens/Roaches from being made. If you lose them, you will most likely lose the game.
- Do not stop for Hatcheries or buildings of any kind. Go straight for the Drones and force some to be pulled off the worker line. If your opponent has their full economy up they will simply outproduce you.
- The only micro you have to do is stutter step against Zerglings/Drones, and pull back the weakest Reaper against Queens.
- 4 Reapers will kill a Queen without you losing a single one of them as long as you pull the targeted Reaper back in time.
- In order to hit the exact build order supplies above, you will have to cut some SCVs for several seconds. I highly recommend watching the tutorial replays (and using the Take Command button with a friend to see how you match up to it) until you get a hang of the build.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,GoOutScv,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,SCV,SCV,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,Reaper,Barracks,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Reaper,SCV,Reaper', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:27:01 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '15 Gas Marine-Hellion Expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This fast expansion build created by Innovation uses Hellions to stay safe against Reapers, Banshees, and Hellbatsall while taking map control.

Scouting

Scouting with this build until you get your first Hellions out is not necessary.  However if you want to SCV scout, checking your opponents gas timing clues you in on what they could possibly be doing.

If your SCV sees that your opponent has mined more gas than you have, the most likely are opening with Reapers. However, even if you do not get into your opponents base, you can still tell a Reaper is coming by leaving your scout next to your opponents Barracks to spot whether it dies to a Marine or a Reaper. Your first 2 Marines positioned in your main at a Reaper jump-up spot, followed up by the Reactor for extra Marine production should crush any aggressive Reaper play if you react with and position your initial Marines well. With the Reactored Hellion follow-up you can seize map control and spot if there are any other pushes coming.

When your second Orbital Command finishes and you are still worried about a 1 base play, consider scanning your opponents main base.  Against 1 base play, be sure to have good vision around your base to prevent elevators and to defend your front with a Bunker. Also, a Missile Turret per mineral line with one Viking will shut down any Widow Mine Drops into Cloak Banshee openers. Lastly, if your opponent is going for Hellbat drops, then producing more than 6 Hellions and starting a Viking can be really helpful for your defensenormal Hellions do quite well against Hellbats, and Vikings do quite well at deterring Medivacs.

Execution

If your opponent invested more than 2 Reapers before expanding into bio play, then this is your cue to do heavy damage. If he played greedy and didnt build a bunker at his natural, you can go in with your 4 Hellions, 6 Marines and your first Medivac and kill his un-upgraded Marines. If there is a Bunker at the natural, then simply elevator your Marines and then Hellions into your opponents main and kill as many units as you can.

Against Mech play you might have to play a bit more conservative with your aggression because in Hellion vs Hellion fights, the player who was positioned correctly before the fight usually has the advantage. Instead of committing to an attack or elevator, pulling your army back and placing down a quick 3rd Command Center is a safer way to play.

Against standard Bio play, you can attempt to hit a Marine/Hellion timing at his front with your first 4 Hellions, 6 Marines, and a Medivac. Or, if your opponent is too well defended at the front, perform a 4 Hellion drop and harass his SCVs instead. Getting your 2nd Barracks and starting Stimpack before taking your 3rd Command Center is crucial to staying safe against 10 minute Bio timings and drop play. Alternatively, going Mech and producing Widow Mines/Siege Tanks as you take your third base is a strong way to stay safe as well.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into anything: Marine/Tank or Mech play. Note that as stated in the Execution section above, the follow-up you can do after you get your initial Marine/Hellion/Medivac army is completely dependent on your own preference and the play style of your opponent.

When transitioning into Bio play, against Mech and 3CC builds you can get away with starting your 3rd CC right away and following-up with 2 Barracks with Tech labs (to start Stimpack/Combat Shields), 3 Refineries, and 2 Engineering bays. Against more traditional Bio play it is necessary to start a Tech lab on your initial Barracks for a quicker Stimpack. Then, after taking a 2nd Refinery, you can build a 2nd Barracks onto the naked Reactor and start Siege Tank production to take yourself into the midgame. This is followed up by a 3rd Command Center (between 8:00-8:30), 1 more Barracks, both Refineries at your natural expansion, and 2 Engineering bays. Not having Stimpack completed in time for the inevitable 10ish minute drop play can be a game changer because with the new Medivacs boosting around your main and natural, it is very easy to get caught out of position and take a lot of damage for free.

ForGG does an interesting follow-up where he simply constantly produces Hellions  sometimes going up to 20+ Hellions  and overwhelms his opponents before they have Stimpack or enough Siege Tanks to deal with this attack. Mass Hellions are surprisingly good against opponents who make Hellbats or try drop play without a perfect follow-up.

Another possible follow-up is going for Mech play. This is easily achieved by keeping the Factory onto the Reactor for more Hellions, getting all 4 Refineries while starting more Factories, and starting your 3rd Command Center very quickly. Building some Vikings for drop defense will definitely come in handy as well.

Pros and Cons

This build defends early pressure quite easily, while getting a quick expansion and going into the midgame. Also, once your first Medivac is out, you hit your opponent with lots of pressure early on to kick start an aggressive game. Finally, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for opening with a 1/1/1 grants you the freedom to go into nearly anything.

However, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades. Also, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Factory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,Starport,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SCV,OrbitalCommand,SCV,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,Medivac', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:27:02 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Alicia 12-12 Colossus All-In', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build utilizes an unconventional Gateway and gas timing to produce a fast Mothership Core for scouting before smoothly transitioning into a 2 Colossus All-in.

Attack your opponent when your 2nd Colossus finishes (@9:30ish) with 2 Colossi, 3 Stalkers, 3 Sentries, and a Mothership Core with about 45 Probes at home.

Scouting

Do not Probe scout with this build. Because you are using a 12/12 opening, you will have an extremely early Mothership Core for immediate scouting. Your Mothership Core should be directly rallied to the enemy base upon completion.

The early Mothership Core allows you to see exactly what a Terran is aiming for. If they are aiming for Factory aggression with a Starport simply chronoboost out 2 Observers, placing one in each base. Position your 3 Stalkers in the main to catch a drop. Bring your Mothership Core home and use it to defend the natural with Photon Overcharge. This defensive setup should allow you to defend any multi-pronged aggression from the Terran.

If it is merely a 2 base, 3 Barracks opener, then proceed as normal.

Transitions

As this is an all-in, the transitions for this build are heavily dependent on the damage you deal. If you kill a significant amount of workers but find yourself unable to finish your opponent off, transition into normal Blink/Colossus play. If you do not kill many workers and lose your army, then you most likely will lose to a follow-up counterattack. If you trade armies but do eventually lose your own, you are free to instantly transition into anything you want?Blink/Colossus, Chargelot/Archon, or Storm play are all equally viable. Remember to start 2 Forges and chronoboost your upgrades to catch up in the upgrade war.

Tips

Produce a third Colossus and leave it at home along with your Mothership Core. This allows you to effectively defend counter aggression with 2 Photon Overcharges. You have enough punch in your frontal push with Forcefield and Guardian Shield not to require Time Warp.

Only chronoboost your 10th and 13th Probe before the completion of your Cybernetics Core. You need to bank energy to allow you to simultaneously chronoboost your Mothership Core and first Stalker. Otherwise your scouting information is delayed and a Reaper can play havoc with your main.

Once you have completed your Mothership Core and initial Stalker, return to chronoboosting Probes until the completion of your Robotics Bay. At this point exclusively chronoboost Colossi. If you find you have spare Nexus energy chronoboost Thermal Lance but prioritize accelerating your Colossus count ? your push begins once both Colossi have been completed.

Pros and Cons

This all-in is one of the most difficult to scout builds currently available to Protoss. To most Terran players it will look like standard macro play and may even prompt incorrect reactions such as earlier Medivac aggression or a fast 3rd Command Center. Also, because of the fast Mothership Core scout, you will almost always be able to identify Terran?s early game build structure (3rax, 1/1/1, etc).

However, because your Mothership Core stays at home for defense and you have no upgrades to fall back on, your attack is fully all-in?there is no way to retreat your Colossus safely if your attack fails and you are certain to fall behind in upgrades as the game stretches on.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Stalker,Chronoboost,WarpgateUpgrade,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Assimilator,Stalker,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,Nexus,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Chronoboost,Stalker,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Observer,RoboticsBay,Assimilator,Assimilator,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,WarpInSentry,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Pylon,Probe,Probe,ExtendedThermalLance,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:07 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = '15 Gas Raven Expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This fast expansion build created by Maru uses a lot of scouting in order to stay safe against Reapers and Banshees, getting out enough Marines and the infrastructure needed to defend all sorts of aggression that early-game TvT can have.

Scouting

Figuring out your opponents opening so that you can react appropriately when you are performing this build is crucial. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that you SCV scout around 12 or 13 supply in order to see whether your opponent has opened gas first or not.

If your SCV gets into your opponents base and sees that your opponents Barracks is delayed compared to yours, you know that they are opening gas first  the most likely scenario being Polts Gas First Banshee Build.  However, there are some Gas First Hellion openers, so stick around until the first Marine pops so that you can see what add-ons your opponent is making. A fast Tech lab usually will be swapped off onto the Starport for a fast Banshee. A fast Reactor can be used to swap off and go for Hellions.  Against Hellion play, build your Command Center and keep your Marines on the high ground.

If you get into your opponents base and see that your opponent has mined more gas than you have, the most likely scenario is that they are opening with Reapers. Note that even if you do not get into your opponents base, you can still tell a Reaper is coming by leaving your scouting SCV next to your opponents Barracks to spot whether the first unit to pop out is a Marine or a Reaper. Against Reaper play, build your Command Center and position your Marines on the high ground. If your opponent commits to 2rax Reaper or Mass Reaper play, transitioning into Innovations Marine/Hellion Expand to stay safe (instead of taking a 2nd gas and instantly opening with a Starport) is a common reaction. With the Reactored Hellion follow-up you can seize map control and deal with Reapers quite easily.

If your opponent is opening with an expansion of their own or has mined the same amount of gas as you have, then consider cutting the Raven and going into delayed Cloaked Banshee OR Siege Tank production of your own. Whichever you choose is personal preference.

When your second Orbital Command finishes and you are still worried about a 1 base play, consider scanning your opponents main base.  Against 1 base non-Banshee play, starting Siege Tanks and using your Raven for Seeker Missile is an easy way to stay safe. Against 1 base Banshee play, position your Marines and Raven near your production or mineral line as you start a Viking or two for extra defense.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either Marine/Tank/Medivac or Mech play.

When transitioning into Marine/Tank play, against Mech and 3CC builds you can get away with starting your 3rd Command Center right away and following-up with 2 Barracks with Tech labs (to start Stimpack/Combat Shields), 3 Refineries, and 2 Engineering bays.

Against a player opening straight into Bio play, however, it is necessary to start a Tech lab on your initial Barracks as soon as possible for a quicker Stimpack. Then, after taking a 2nd Refinery, you can build a 2nd Barracks onto the naked Reactor and start Siege Tank production to take yourself into the midgame. This is followed up by a 3rd Command Center (between 8:00-8:30), 1 more Barracks, both Refineries at your natural expansion, and 2 Engineering Bays. Not having Stimpack completed in time for the inevitable 10ish minute drop play can be a game changer because with the new Medivacs boosting around your main and natural, it is very easy to get caught out of position and take a lot of damage for free.

Another possible follow-up is going for Mech play. By starting a 3rd Command Center instantly, getting all 4 Refineries, and making 2 more Factories and an Armory, youll instantly be at the midgame infrastructure you need. Be sure to make Vikings for drop defense and start your Siege Tank production instantly so that you have a healthy Siege Tank count to defend any early drops/pressure.

Tips

- Fully read the Scouting section of this build before performing it in a game.  The reactions to scouting information as presented in the Scouting section must be learned before this build is even worth performing in a real game.
- SCV scout with this build at 12 or 13 supply.
- If you are absolutely sure your opponent is not opening with Banshee play, then starting delayed Banshee production of your own instead of the Raven is a great way to get midgame map control and a lot more scouting information.
- Against the first Banshee, you might need to pull all of your Marines to your production or mineral line while you wait for the Raven to pop.  This is completely fine  try to minimize damage by pulling all of your SCVs to one location so that your Raven provides detection over all of your vulnerable spots once it is out.
- Anticipate how many Banshees your opponent is making and either continue to produce Vikings or stop after 1 or 2 for safety.
- Be sure to transition into your midgame infrastructure as soon as you have successfully defended the Banshees.

Pros and Cons

This build defends early pressure quite easily, while getting a quick expansion and going into the midgame. Also, this build is incredibly versatile when it comes to transitions, for opening with a 1/1/1 grants you the freedom to transition into nearly anything.

However, this build requires a lot of scouting in order to be performed effectively. The reactions and transitions you must perform depend entirely on your scouting information and interpretation of your opponents build order.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Factory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,Refinery,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Starport,DoubleMarines,SCV,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,LandStarportOnTechLab,Raven,WidowMine,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,ScannerSweep,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,LiftStarportFromTechLab,LandFactoryOnTechLab,SiegeTank,SupplyDepot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:07 PM;

Going straight for colossus double forge is extremely passive and leaves no real room for you to do much until you get your 3rd base saturated. However opening blink allows you that small amount of map control/versatility that we loved oh so much a few patches ago that was unfortunately ripped from our repertoire.

The other cool thing about this build is that unless they open gas first, you can do this build basically any game. Even 1 rax reaper into factory gets shut down by this since the 2nd observer comes out in time to deal with any widow mine drops that will come from that build. You can even do some follow up blink pressure with a lot of added stalkers to punish them while they're building their infrastructure up and their unit count is low.

Even the 3 rax stim builds that I made a thread on earlier this week can be stopped with this build. I found out really that once you see that build coming into form, then it's all about not being greedy with your tech and trying to get a colossus out ASAP or something like that. You just need to make as many units as possible out of your gateways. It won't hold it as well as the purely defensive robo/3gate style however you definitely can still make the hold so long as you get your gates at the time in this write up and not later like in some variants.

This build puts us back in control again which is what we have wanted for so long after blink/HT openers have been pushed out of style. Of course the only down side to this build is that the upgrades are later, however you can easily compensate for that with double forge and mass amounts of chronoboost being used into it. Since the build is so solid you shouldn't be losing too many probes to early harassment (early blink helps with that so much) so the only thing that you'll need to use your chronoboost on is the upgrades.

Adding a warp prism or two while you're getting your 3rd set up also meshes with this build very well. Many protosses (PartinG especially) almost always go for a warp prism to do a 4 zealot drop after they do some light harassment with the stalkers. It's just an added way to keep the terran back as you get your colossus set up and really keep the terran on their side of the map for as long as possible.

This variant on the standard 1rax FE build gets the midgame infrastructure up much earlier for a lot of midgame aggression, while sacrificing early safety against one and early two base Protoss attacks.

Scouting

When you send your scouting SCV, look for the number of gasses your opponent has, their Nexus energy, and also the units they are producing out of the Gateway. If he only has 1 gas before his stalker pops, check to see whether your opponent gets his natural at around 5:15 (You can hide your SCV nearby and then run it in around 5:30 to check for an expansion later if need be). If he has 2 gas or is not spending his chronoboost, then be wary of any sort of early attack.

Tips

- To confirm that your opponent is not all-inning you, have an SCV (or scan) go to his natural just before the 6 minute mark.  A 4gate will hit before this timing, but 2 bunkers and repair should be able to hold a 4gate easily enough; all other all-ins hit much later and this scout will give you enough time to mount an appropriate defense.
- You cannot afford Marauders with this build until you start the Starport. The 100 extra minerals and 50 gas from making 2 Marauders at a time will slow down the push by over a minute.
- Take map control when you initially poke out with your first two Medivacs. Do NOT engage Protoss yet though. This build sets up your infrastructure for a lot of reinforcements, but does not increase your army size until those reinforcements have actually arrived.
- Once the first or second wave of units from all 5 Barracks have popped (you should be making 3 Marauders and 4 marines at a time), straight up fight Protoss? army. Spread your army, kite Zealots, pick up units trapped between forcefields and zealots with Medivacs, and dodge storms as best you can. However, do not forget to build reinforcing units, and do not stop the aggression unless you are forced to. During this aggression, you also get to see what army composition your opponent has.  Get a 4th Refinery.  Then react appropriately to Colossus by making Vikings (and possibly a 2nd Starport) and to High Templar by making Ghosts.

Transitions

During the fighting, place down your 3rd CC, 2nd Engineering Bay and Armory, and Ghost academy or 2nd Starport to counter your opponent?s HTs or Colossi. Fighting your opponent across the map forces them to reveal which tech path they?ve gone down and safely give you the time you need to counter it before it comes to your base.

Pros and Cons

This 1rax FE variant cuts many early-game corners compared to other 1rax FEs.  Delaying the 2nd Refinery means that you cannot afford any Marauders at all until after your Starport has been started. Thus, in case your opponent does an early-game attack, you have to rely on Bunkers and SCVs to repair and tank damage much more than you would in other builds. However, what this build lacks in the early game it more than makes up for in the mid game. Getting five Barracks up that fast means that you can apply a lot of midgame aggression against your opponent.  With proper micro, it?s entirely possible to overrun the front with pure Marine/Marauder/Medivac even against Colossi or HTs, simply because of how many units you are reinforcing with.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,CommandCenter,SupplyDepot,SCV,Marine,CallMule,SCV,Bunker,Marine,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,Marine,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,CallMule,Marine,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,Bunker,Marine,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,SCV,StimPack,Refinery,SupplyDepot,Marine,Marine,Marine,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,CallMule,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,Factory,EngineeringBay,Refinery,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,CallMule,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,TechLabOnBarracks,ReactorOnBarracks,Marauder,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,CombatShield,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMedivacs,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnBarracks,ReactorOnBarracks', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:07 PM;

Simple, economical, and deceptively dangerous, Bomber takes us back to 2012 with an incredibly early 16 Marine Combat Shield Push that simultaneously takes a 6:00 3rd. An excellent low APM alternative for players who dislike Reapers and Hellions.

Scouting

Because you are not opening Reapers, you are in danger of unexpected Roach or Speedling attacks. And because you are not making Hellions, you will have difficulty confirming the existence of a Zerg third base if Speedlings are on the map, as well as being vulnerable to unscouted Baneling Busts. As such, your only SCV scout is crucial in determining if your Zerg opponent has opened with gas or not.

If your opponent has opened gasless, keep your scouting SCV alive and hidden as long as possible to confirm the existence of a third base by 6:30. If no third is taken by 6:30, it is worth scanning, as many dangerous builds, such as Soulkeys 1-1 Roach Timing, start gasless off of two bases.

If your opponent has opened gas but stopped mining at 100 gas, assume that Speedlings are on the way. As such, depending on how quickly your opponent chose to take his gas, a wall off is necessary before six minutes. It is fine to use your 3rd CC as part of your natural wall off on certain maps, such as Frost, Yeonsu, and Polar Night. However, if your opponent went for much faster Speedlings (Gas -> Pool -> Hatch), then it is advisable to wall off ASAP using Depots and bunkers, and delaying your 3rd CC. Additionally, consider not performing your Marine timing if the speedling count is abnormally high (30 or above).

If your opponent has opened gas but has continued mining past 100, it is necessary to check whether or not Metabolic Boost is researching with your scouting SCV. Beyond that, scan to see what is coming your way and build extra bunkers if necessary. You are specifically looking for a combination of the following: obvious tech cues (baneling nest, roach warren, fast lair), lack of Queens/Creep Spread (if there are only two injecting, then something is wrong), lack of Evolution Chambers, lack of a timely third base, and a flood of overlords.

It is highly reommended you do not perform your timing unless it is obvious your opponent is opening nonthreatening gas tech, such as Overlord Speed or very fast upgrades. And finally, depending on what you scout, if it becomes very obvious that no timing will occur, consider getting Stimpack instead of Combat Shields, as well as producing Marauders from your tech labbed Barracks.

Transitions

Because you have already invested so much infrastructure into Barracks and infantry upgrades, your only transition from this build is a bio based composition. However, because you have invested no money whatsoever into Factory tech, you can transition smoothly into Biomine, Biobat, Biobat with Thors, Marine Tank, or even Pure Bio.

Additionally, the Factory and Engineering Bay ordering is entirely up to the users discretion. If you feel you are in danger of a counter all in, or want faster Medivacs for aggression, then start the Factory first. If you feel that you do not want to fall behind in upgrades, start two Engineering bays first.

Tips

Your first priority with this build is accurately assessing whether or not you can do damage with a timing push.

If you feel you can do damage with the timing, do your best to ensure your opponent has as little idea of it as possible. Have lone marines ready at your base to deny Overlord scouting, and hide the bulk of your marines on the main ramp connecting to the natural base. Keep your Barracks away from the edges of your base; especially the one with a researching Tech Lab. If there is a way to construct a third base that an Overlord can obviously see it (such as by the natural choke at Polar Night, where there is almost always an overlord), then that would be best. Most Zergs upon seeing such an early third will let their guard down and drone heavily.

As youre moving out with the Marine squad at 7:00, have at least two scans saved and do your best to avoid obvious overlord positions, and either clear the towers beforehand (impossible vs Speedlings) or avoid them altogether if possible. The best possible scenario is you catch your opponent completely off guard with no Larva banked in the middle of a huge cycle of drones, with 16 marines at his third base.

Use your banked scans as best you can to clear huge swatches of creep, with priority on active tumors. If you do kill the third, use your discretion to decide whether or not attacking further into the natural (emphasis now on the Evolution Chambers or Nat Hatch) or retreating with your marines is the better choice.

DO NOT REINFORCE THIS PUSH. It relies heavily on the element of surprise. Once Zerg reacts and begins to produce cycles of defending units, your reinforcements (3 marines every 25 seconds) will be easily overwhelmed without force multipliers such as Widow Mines, Medivacs, or Battlecruisers.

During the actual engagements, stutter stepping and positioning are critical. Wedging all your marines into the mineral line of his third and using his hatchery as a choke seems to be the optimal engagement zone. If slow banes are involved, split as best you can without stim or target fire them down.

On the other hand, if you feel you cannot do damage with your timing, theres no problem whatsoever. Stay behind your walloff, make bunkers if necessary, and wait for Factory Tech and Medivacs to perform a standard creep clearing push. You are already ahead with your 6:00 3rd and triple MULE income.

Pros and Cons

This build is one of the most economical builds available while still having a surprising amount of potential to outright win a game. It also deflects non baneling based aggression excellently, such as Roach Ling timings. Additionally, the build has a surprising amount of creep clearing potential, as few Zergs will stand toe to toe with 16 Combat Shield Marines this early in the game; most Zergs will surrender their creep without a fight.

The weaknesses of this build, however, are equally apparent.If scouted, the push has a high chance of outright failing. In addition, because your infrastructure is so limited during and following the attack (3 mostly naked Barracks), you are extremely susceptible to counter all ins and heavy Baneling based counter attacks, especially after you kill their third but lose all 16 marines in the process.

And finally, because you have not opened Reapers or hellions, your information is extremely limited, and confirming the existence of a third base can be very difficult if you lose your scouting SCV too early on.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,OrbitalCommand,Marine,CommandCenter,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,Marine,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,OrbitalCommand,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Marine,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,CombatShield,SCV,SCV,Marine,Marine,Marine,CommandCenter,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Marine,Refinery,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,Marine,Marine,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,CallMule,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,EngineeringBay,EngineeringBay,ReactorOnBarracks,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,StimPack,OrbitalCommand,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,InfantryArmorLevel1,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Factory,Refinery,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marauder,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Starport,ReactorOnFactory,SCV,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Marauder,Armory,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,CallMule,TechLabOnFactory,Factory,SCV,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DrillingClaws,Barracks,Barracks,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,ConcussiveShells,InfantryWeaponsLevel2,InfantryArmorLevel2,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,ReactorOnFactory,CommandCenter,Marauder,DoubleMedivacs', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:07 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Bomber Reaper FE to Bio', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE, optimized by Startale Bomber, gets out exactly one Reaper for scouting as well and a ridiculously fast Command Center. Then it follows up with a Bio army with just as much strength as a gasless 1rax FE can provide.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they get an expansion (or note if they do not expand by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Also, if you do not know whether your opponent has a Stargate or not, it is a safe plan to build one Missile Turret per mineral line to defend any Oracle shenanigans.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and Medivacs. After this build, get a 3rd Command Center, 3 more Barracks (for a total of 8), and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to head into a strong, late game army.

Note: It is completely viable to replace the 4th and 5th Barracks in this build with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost, most Terrans (including Startale Bomber) have been getting lots of Barracks early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having those extra reinforcements.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important  be sure to mine exactly 100 Gas so that you have enough for the Reaper and Reactor and no more.  Getting your natural Command Center up before the 2nd Supply Depot is a strength of this build.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add a 2nd Bunker at the front, and consider getting a Missile Turret in each mineral line.
- Oracles, even with an expansion, massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you have to instantly get out one Missile Turret per mineral line.
- The gas timings of this build are somewhat more delayed than what you might be used to if you usually play with a gasless 1rax FE.  Therefore, be sure to cut all Marauder production until after your Starport has completed.
- When you move out with your Medivacs, be sure to boost in and out of where your opponent is expecting.  Forcing out the Mothership Cores energy can be the difference between an quick win and a potential loss.

Pros and Cons

This build is good because it gives you the economy and infrastructure on par with a Wings of Liberty style 1rax FE. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Getting such a fast Reactor gives you enough marines to defend early game Stalker + Mothership Core harass.  Finally, this build takes no detours and goes directly into Bio+Medivac play, so your Stim+Medivac aggression happens much sooner than if you go for an early Widow Mine Drop.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes, especially if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that with such a low Marine count in the early game, fast Oracles can do a lot of damage if your scouting/turret timing is not perfect.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Barracks,Bunker,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,StimPack,Marine,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,Factory,EngineeringBay,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,Marine,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Marine,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Starport,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnFactory,ScannerSweep,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,CombatShield,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,SCV,DoubleMedivacs,Marauder,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Barracks,Barracks,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,InfantryArmorLevel1,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,DoubleMedivacs,SCV,SCV,Barracks,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:07 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Creator Blink-obs expand', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'This build allows for a huge amount of versatility by being able to deal with pretty much any opener they can throw at you.

The idea is that you get a lot of units out of 1 gate while teching up to blink and robo so that way you can easily split your forces to deal with the variety of openings that can come at you. Once you determine your position in the game, you can easily expand and start teching up to immortal/archon.

So how exactly do you deal with the different openings?

Stargate:

This is a fairly simple one. Most of the time you won't be able to see that they're going stargate (unless it's a very quick directly after cyber build) in which case you will be playing defensively with your units anyway. Whether it's phoenix or oracle you will have 3 stalkers and a MSCore to deal with whatever comes at you with an additional 3 stalkers coming out of WG once that finishes, with blink soon following. This allows for a very easy stargate defense in which case you can then expand and put on light pressure with your blink/obs while defending at home with the MSCore.

If you want you can cancel the robo to go for a blink all in after seeing this, however some people (like Zest in the Shoutcraft tournament) will go for stargate and then DT to follow it up if they see you do blink/robo expecting you to cancel it. However this is usually because of pros at the highest level trying to get every ounce of their money for something beneficial, so it was mostly a smart gamble by Zest.

Blink:

With blink you're going to have to identify it a little early. If you see a large stalker opening then blink should be in the back of your mind. In this case you can easily get an immortal out with time bought by overcharge so you can have blink + immo to his pure blink. If he commits heavily then you can usually just counter push for the win, or you can simply expand and be ahead since you have the tech advantage.

DT:

This is quite simple as well. Robo finishes, you get an obs out, you kill DTs, you expand and continue as normal.

Robo expand:

In this situation your nexus will be slightly farther behind than his, however you will have the ability to poke and prod at him with blink so the slightly later nexus is not the biggest of deals. You will have added mobility and you will also know that they are being super passive so you can chrono probes nonstop to get back on the same economic footing. The best thing you can do with your stalkers is to pick off sentries that you see in the front. This denies him scouting (no hallucination) and requires him to waste gas he doesn't want to replenish them if he really wants to.

After you defend whatever build your opponent is going for and you have your natural set up, you want to simply transition into immortal/archon.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,GoOutProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Zealot,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Stalker,Chronoboost,WarpgateUpgrade,Pylon,Probe,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Stalker,Probe,TwilightCouncil,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon,Blink,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Stalker,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Observer,Nexus,WarpInSentry,Probe,Pylon,Immortal,Probe,Probe,Forge,Probe,Probe,Pylon,GroundWeaponsLevel1,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Immortal,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Immortal,Probe,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Charge,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,GroundWeaponsLevel2,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Immortal,Pylon,TemplarArchives', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:07 PM;

This build opens with a 3 Gateways and Blink, using a Hallucinated Phoenix to scout for potential Dark Shrine or Stargate shenanigans. It produces a healthy Stalker count to apply pressure to your opponent or safely secure your expansion against any all-in.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker(s) back to the protection of your Sentry quickly if you have to defend an early attack.
The majority of your scouting comes from your Hallucinated Phoenix. Your phoenix should be able to get into your opponent?s main base and determine what tech route you see your opponent going.
- If your opponent is expanding quickly, then consider warping in Stalkers non-stop from a proxy Pylon as you all-in your opponent with a Blink all-in. Should you choose to expand instead, you will be slightly behind economically ? but with Blink.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then be sure that you do NOT over produce Stalkers.  Instead, expand and fall back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.
- If your opponent has a Stargate, then be sure to not take damage against early Phoenix or Oracles by initially positioning your Stalkers defensively. You can expand quite easily behind your Blink play and go into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame or all-in your opponent if you spot them taking a fast expansion behind the Stargate.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then consider getting a Robotics Facility instantly in order to make one Observer for detection against DTs. If you are sure your opponent is also opening with Blink, then constantly produce Immortals and defend a natural expansion OR skip the Robotics Facility entirely and try to win the Blink Stalker vs Blink Stalker micro war.

Transitions

This build is a very safe opener that allows you either to all-in your opponent with Blink Stalkers or transitions into a macro game quite easily. However, the actual steps you take to transition into it often depend completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with. This is why scouting with the Hallucinated Phoenix and generally being active on the map with your Blink Stalkers is crucial.
If you choose to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly produce Stalkers 3 at a time from your proxy Pylons and attack as soon as Blink Research is finished (@7:40ish). Bait out a Planetary Nexus and/or kill the Mothership Core and as many Sentries as possible before fully committing to an attack. If your opponent is on one base, you can still expand at home ? using your Sentry to force field the ramp to stop his army from coming down and engaging you with his entire army.
In Twilight vs Stargate macro games, abuse your mobility to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you have a strong midgame Chargelot/Immortal/Archon army ready. In Twilight vs Robotics macro games, again abuse your mobility to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you get a healthy Chargelot/Archon count up.  Keep tabs on your opponent?s tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Twilight vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponent?s potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by getting a Robotics Facility and producing Observers/Immortals or by winning the Blink Stalker vs Blink Stalker position battles in the open field.
The most common way to start the transition into Chargelot/Immortal/Archon is by starting a 2nd Nexus, a Robotics Facility and 2 more Assimilators, a Forge for +1 Ground Weapons, and Zealot Charge research in that order. Add on the Templar Archives and Archons when you can afford it.

Tips

- Once you start your Mothership Core, save your chronoboost so that you can dump it all into Blink Research. Only 1 or 2 chronoboosts should be spent on Warpgate (unless you spot your opponent going for very early aggression).
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial Stalkers to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap?s 3gate All-in).
- Against Stargate play, be sure to position your units to defend your mineral line from potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- If you choose to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly chronoboost Blink and then later your Gateways to get the maximal amount of units out with Blink as soon as possible. Bait out a Planetary Nexus and/or kill the Mothership Core and as many Sentries as possible before fully committing to an attack. If your opponent is on one base, you can still expand at home ? using your Sentry to force field the ramp to stop his army from coming down and engaging you with his entire army.
- If you choose to expand behind this build, do not produce more than 8 Stalkers which you should use to take map control and poke your opponent?s front. Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases. Transitioning into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon unit composition is very strong.

Pros and Cons

This build is a versatile, aggressive build that can pressure your opponent or defend basically any all-in with Blink Stalkers. It gets a fast Hallucinated Phoenix scout your opponent?s main base and let you know if you need detection, should reposition your army, or all-in your opponent.
However, this build requires a lot of scouting information to be executed effectively, so getting a Hallucination into your opponent?s base is crucial.

If you want you can totally take a slightly later 3rd (~8-9 minutes) and just get 3 extra gates before the expand if you don't feel comfortable taking the fast 3rd. Just make sure you keep the robo timing the same.

This build really relies on you being able to scout with the oracle and reacting to what the zerg is doing. It's a very reactive and versatile opening which why I said it doesn't really die to anything as long as you execute it properly. Even if the stargate gets scouted/the oracle can't get too much done don't worry. You at least want to get scouting information with it as that is the most important. The drone or queen kills are only an added bonus if they aren't prepared.

If you see any sort of ling pressure to contest your 3rd then you should bring the oracle back to help defend. It's best to move the oracle down the common path of attack when it spawns to see if this kind of pressure is coming.

Any roach aggression can be stopped by earlier void ray production and even a few immortals before colossi if it's really early roach aggression.

Defending hydra/ling attacks is all about good sim city and forcefields and being sure your colossus doesn't get supply blocked or delayed at all. Your colossus being late is probably the worst thing you can do with this build as that's what really keeps you alive vs a lot of zerg pressure.

And of course if you see spire play then you have 3 stargates to make mass phoenix.

Once your 3rd is up and you get a decent void ray count up you can start teching to twilight council if you didn't have to already because you scouted a fast hive from zerg.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Dear Phoenix into Colossus', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Forge Fast Expand and then gets several Phoenix for map control and scouting. While you are using the scouting Phoenix, you transition into Colossus play in order to secure your third base and set up a stable midgame OR all-in your opponent with a Stalker/Colossus/Phoenix army.

Scouting

After any early game shenanigans are ruled out, as you have spotted your opponent s third Hatchery going down, the rest of your scouting will come from your Phoenix.

Use your Phoenix to first pick off every Overlord on the map that is undefended by creep/Queens. Then use them to poke around your opponent s base   picking up units not protected by Spore Crawlers/Queens. Be sure to focus on what tech structures you see your opponent making. If you spot a swell of Roaches, stay on 2 bases and consider extra Immortals. If you spot a Hydralisk Den, be sure your Robotics Bay is constantly producing Colossus. If you spot a Spire, instantly get a Twilight Council and go for Blink/+2 Ground Weapons while you resume Phoenix production from your Stargate. You might have to cancel your Colossus production.

Transitions

This build can either all-in off of 2 bases or safely secure a third base to comfortably play a macro game.

If you are choosing to all-in with this build, be sure to go up to 8 Gateways and 3 Colossus with Extended Thermal Lance before moving out. Constantly reinforce with Stalkers as you use your +1/+1, 3-Colossus, 5-Phoenix, 8 Gateway all-in to crush through a Roach/Hydra based army. Watch out for Viper play, though!

If you are choosing to play the macro game, timing your third base is tricky. Dear warps in a lot of Zealots from his 4 Gateways before securing his third if he sees any amount of units on the map with his constant Phoenix scouting. If Dear doesn t see any Roach/Ling force out on the map (as in game 3 of Dear vs Soulkey), then he will take it even before his first Colossus is started. As you take your third base, set up a Cannon defense surrounded by Pylons/Gateways to help with Zergling runbys as you tech up into the late game. Getting a Twilight Council to continue +2 Ground Weapons and Blink is a solid way to both deal with tech switches and set you up for a 3 base attack. Be sure to spend your excess minerals on proxy Pylons and Zealot runbys to keep your opponent s base count in check.

Tips

- Spend all of your early game chronoboost on your two Nexus to maximize Probe production.
- The exact FFE build order you use is up to your personal preference. Dear has performed this build after a Forge First FFE, Nexus First FFE, and a failed attempted Cannon Rush.
- If possible, hide the Stargate somewhere in your base that is less likely to be scouted by an Overlord.
- Chronoboost your Stargate to get out those Phoenix as quickly as possible to deny any Overlord scouting of your follow-up Robotics transition.
A main strength of this build is its versatility, but you can only be versatile if you have the necessary scouting information. Scouting your opponent s tech path and army production with your Phoenix is crucial.
- If you spot your opponent playing very greedy, you can choose to warp-in all of your Zealots from your 4 Gateways aggressively and hit a +1 Zealot/Phoenix timing while continuing the build at home.
- Chronoboost your Robotics Facility to get out your Colossus as quickly as possible and set up a solid midgame army.

Pros and Cons

This build is an incredibly versatile build that can be used as a macro opener or a 2 base all-in. It gets out early Phoenix for scouting and map control while transitioning into a solid ground based Colossus midgame.

However, this build requires a lot of APM and focus in order to execute.

This 1gate FE follows up with a 6gate, 2 base Blink Stalker attack, using the Mothership Core for high ground vision and Time Warp.

Benchmark: When Blink finishes (@7:40ish), you should have with 6 Stalkers and 36 Probes at home.

Attack your opponent?s natural/main with your first full warp-in from all 6 Gateways (@8:30ish) with 12 Blink Stalkers and constant Stalker reinforcements.

Scouting

This build is an aggressive opener that makes a lot of units, so you will not have to worry about Probe scouting. Against Reaper play, keep your first Stalker on a common hop-up ledge in order to deny your opponent scouting the Twilight Council. Against other defensive play, poke out to your opponent?s front with your first Stalker and check to see whether your opponent is going for Widow Mines or a quick CC into Bio so you know how to micro when you Blink into his main base with all of your units.

Transitions

This build is a strong 2 base Blink Timing that commits a lots of resources to Stalkers and no resources to upgrades or tech, so your follow-up will be quite slow. If your attack does damage and you keep most of your units alive, then you can start 2 more Assimilators, 2 Forges, and a Templar Archives, in order to transition into a Chargelot/Storm unit composition with Blink Stalkers to help deal with drops. However, if you do not deal some damage with your initial Stalkers, then you will be behind both economically and in tech against an opponent who will have Stimpack and Medivacs soon to follow.

Tips

- Do not bother Probe scouting early on because you can do this build against nearly everything your opponent chooses to open with.
- With your initial Stalkers, either protect your main base from a Reaper scouting your Twilight Council or move out and poke up at your opponent?s base for some early scouting intel.
- The limiting factor with this build is Blink Research?s build time and finishing your 6 Gateways, so be sure to Chronoboost Blink Research constantly in order to attack as soon as possible.
- Keep your Mothership Core out of harm?s way.  Use its 14 sight range for high ground vision, but do not commit the Mothership Core in the attack because without high ground vision, your attack will most likely fail.
- Do not forget to use your Mothership Core?s Time Warp ability to help pick off SCVs or Bio units that are out of position.
- Do NOT over-commit your Stalkers in a risky blink. Only aggressively blink to get up to a high ground or to pick off a Siege Tank/Widow Mine before it activates.
- Constantly warping-in more Stalkers to reinforce your army and add strength to the attack is key to crushing through your opponent?s defenses.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong build because of how quickly you get both high ground vision with your Mothership Core and enough Blink Stalkers to do real damage ? after opening with a 1gate FE. While your opponent might have Stimpack done in time for the attack, you can still beat your opponent in the open field if you use Time Warp and Blink appropriately.

However, this build commits a lot of resources to the attack, so transitioning into standard play will be much further behind if you had just rushed for High Templars and upgrades.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Duckdeok 3gate Robo', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a 3 Stalker Rush to take map control, and follows up with a 1base 3gate Robo in order to pressure you opponent, get detection, and play safe against Blink/Stargate builds. This pressure build produces somewhat stable macro games if you react appropriately to your scouting information.

Scouting

For all early game scouting, please refer to the Scouting section of the 3 Stalker Rush build.

After your initial units have scouted around your side of the map, the majority of your scouting will come from your 3gate pressure at your opponent?s base.

- If your opponent is fast expanding, then attempt to cancel the Nexus before it finishes. Warp in more units at your proxy Pylon for extra pressure.
- If your opponent has just as many (or almost as many) Gateway units as you, immediately fall back and begin Immortal production. Against either Gateway attacks or Blink All-ins, you need a high Immortal count in order to defend.
- If your opponent does not have as many Gateway units as you, then push up the ramp and attempt to kill his army. Do NOT over-commit once your opponent has activated Photon Overcharge. If you cannot push up his ramp, then warp-in a Sentry or two at his natural and set up a contain while you expand back at home. If during the contain a Stargate unit flies into your base, be sure to activate your Photon Overcharge in order to keep your Probes alive.

Transitions

Once you have set up or a contain or you are forced to retreat back home, be sure to setup your natural expansion. Going into the macro game, however, the actual unit composition of your army very often depends completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with.  If your opponent stays on one base for too long, then throw down more Gateways, constantly make units, and prepare to defend your natural with Stalkers, Immortals, and your Planetary Nexus. In Robotics vs Stargate macro games, quickly switch into Blink or double Stargate play of your own so as to not lose against any Void Ray based armies. In Robotics vs Robotics macro games, Immortal count and/or Colossus count are the most important things. Keep tabs on your opponent?s tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Robotics vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponent?s potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by producing Immortals+Gateway units or Colossus for defense.

Tips

- Split your initial chronoboost on Probes and Warpgate Research in the early game so that you are not economically behind but still have a quick Warpgate attack.
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial 3 Stalkers to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap?s 3gate All-in).
- Against fast tech plays, your initial 3gate pressure should give you information on both the type and timing of your opponent?s attack. Be sure not to over-commit your Stalkers here, however, for Blink or Immortal all-ins will be able to hold your attack and counter-attack with a lot of force if you are careless with your initial units.
- Against Blink play (or your opponent has a lot of Stalkers when you pressure), be sure to pull back immediately and start Immortal production.
- Against Stargate play, use your Photon Overcharge to push back any Oracles or Phoenix if your Stalker army is out of position.
- Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very versatile, safe build that takes advantage of early Gateway units to apply pressure as well as defend every sort of all-in that can hit you. It also gets detection and Immortals for defense against ground-based all-ins, so very often you have a more stable opening than most other PvP builds.

However, this build forces you to be active on the map with your initial units.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'DT-Robo into Archon-Blink push', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'So this build has become more and more popular in PvP recently and this blink follow up is a really fun way to end it early since they will usually play greedy if they see you expand so you can hit pretty hard.

The opening is pretty simple and straight forward and easy to execute. The dark shrine can be proxied or it can be put in base. On 4 player maps its best to proxy it since you can put the proxy in a base far away from theirs while already on your scouting path so it's pretty convenient and you can pull some cute mindgames with a fake chrono on the twilight to fake blink if they scout you.

This build is pretty much safe vs any opening. Vs fast WG attacks you use overcharge to buy enough time to get the DT's out so you can defend and harass at the same time and abuse their lack of detection. If they're smart they will see your lack of units and start a late robo or forge, however you can usually keep it from finishing with how early your DTs come out.

Vs standard robo expands your nexus will be a little bit later, however you can either make up for this by using warp prism/DT harass or doing the blink follow up to abuse their low production capability.

Vs blink you obviously just kinda win so that's always nice.

Stargate openers are the only real problem. If they go phoenix they will usually scout with the first one and will be able to pick apart what you're doing. In which case you can just play more conservatively and get extra gates before you expand to be sure you don't die to a phoenix/gateway all in. Use the DT to determine if he's expanding or not so you can react properly. If they bank the phoenix then you basically just win.

If they go for oracle pressure they sometimes can just win if they're good at identifying early and remember to leave an oracle at home. Otherwise you can usually hold it off decently well but it is definitely the most burdensome to deal with (besides proxy oracle, which just blows in general.)

If they go DT's too then you have that weird thing where you just kinda continue normally as if nothing happened. That's why you get the robo obviously so you don't die vs their potential DTs.

This build opens with a Stargate for Phoenix and some early ground units to provide the infrastructure necessary to react to every build an opposing Protoss might throw at you.

Benchmark: When your Nexus finishes (@6:45ish), you should have 3 Phoenix, 1 Sentry, 1 Stalker, a Mothership Core, and around 23 Probes.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker back to the protection of your Sentry quickly if you have to defend an early attack.

The majority of your scouting comes from your Phoenix. Your Phoenix should be able to get into your opponent?s main base and determine what tech route you see your opponent going.

- If your opponent is expanding quickly, then feel safe while applying some light harass with your Phoenix. You can dictate the pace of the game by committing to a lot of Phoenix or starting a Twilight Council or Robotics Facility and defaulting back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then be sure that deal some economic damage with your initial Phoenix. Either commit to Phoenix and Void Rays or default back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.
- If your opponent has a Stargate, then be sure to not take damage against early Phoenix or Oracles by initially positioning your units defensively.  Getting a healthy Phoenix lead against your opponent will most likely be enough for you to end the game.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then consider getting a Robotics Facility instantly in order to make one Observer for detection against DTs.  Alternatively, you can position your units with an Oracle at your main ramp and defend for a while. Regardless, do not make more Phoenix and instead transition into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame with your economic advantage.

Transitions

This build is a very safe opener that gives you the scouting capabilities and infrastructure to react to any build your opponent can perform. However, the actual steps you take to transition into a stable midgame often depend completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with. This is why scouting with your Phoenix and generally being active on the map (perhaps with a delayed scouting Probe) is crucial.

In Stargate vs Twilight macro games, harass your opponent with your Phoenix, but transition out of Stargate units into an economic Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame as soon as possible. In Stargate vs Robotics macro games, again harass your opponent to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you get a healthy Chargelot/Archon count up. Keep tabs on your opponent?s tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Stargate vs Stargate macro games, position your Phoenix more defensively while you chronoboost your Phoenix non-stop.

The most common way to start the transition into Chargelot/Immortal/Archon is by starting a Robotics Facility and 2 more Assimilators, followed by a Twilight Council and Forge for +1 Ground Weapons and Zealot Charge. Add on the Templar Archives and Archons when you can afford it.

Tips

- Once you start your Mothership Core, save your chronoboost so that you can dump it all into Phoenix. There is no need to chronoboost Warpgate (unless you spot your opponent going for very early aggression).
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial few Gateway units to stop a Probe from setting up a proxy Pylon and allowing for a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap?s 3gate All-in).
- Against Stargate play, position your Stargate units defensively around your mineral lines to defend potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- Otherwise, always be active with your Phoenixes. The main priority for the Phoenix is to get scouting information, for only when you have a full read on your opponent?s build can you can start chronoboosting probes and enter the midgame.
- Even though you open with a Stargate, transitioning into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon unit composition in the midgame can be very strong.
- When entering the late game, however, be sure to produce Tempest from your inactive Stargate?especially against a Colossus-based opponent.

Pros and Cons

This build is a versatile, economic build that can harass your opponent and provide the scouting information necessary to defend a fast expansion.  Also, your Phoenix can do terrible, terrible damage to Robo-based build such as duckdeok?s 3Gate Robo, and even perform well in a macro game against greedy builds such as NaNiwa?s Safe Expand.

However, this build requires a lot of scouting information to be executed effectively. It also is quite difficult to defend early attacks if you do not kill your opponent?s proxy Pylon. Finally, early Dark Templar builds can be deadly if unscouted.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Sentry,MothershipCore,WarpgateUpgrade,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Stargate,Stalker,Nexus,Probe,Probe,Phoenix,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Gateway,Gateway,Phoenix,Probe,Probe,Phoenix,Chronoboost,SwitchToWarpgate', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:08 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'DeMusliM Reaper FE', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This HotS Reaper FE, optimized by Flash and DeMusliM, gets out exactly one Reaper for scouting and a ridiculously fast Engineering Bay for an early +1 Infantry Attack in order to hit a 10 minute timing with +1/+1, Stimpack, and Medivacs.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (opening with a Reaper FE means that you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they expand (or note if they do not get a fast expansion by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Also, if you do not know whether or not your opponent has built a Stargate, taking advantage of your ridiculously fast Engineering Bay to build a Missile Turret is not a bad idea too.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and Medivacs.  After this build, secure your 3rd Command Center, continue your upgrades with +2 Infantry Attack, build 6 more Barracks (for a total of 8), and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to go into a strong, late game army. Your fast third Command Center and early upgrades means that your late game army will be much stronger than your opponents assuming that you are able to deny their third base with your initial Medivac poke.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important  be sure to mine exactly 100 Gas so that you have enough for the Reaper and Reactor and no more.  Getting your natural Command Center up before the 2nd Supply Depot is a major strength of this build.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add a 2nd Bunker at the front, and consider getting a Missile Turret in each mineral line. 
- Oracles, even with an expansion, massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you have to instantly get out one Missile Turret per mineral line.
- The gas timings of this build are somewhat more delayed than what you might be used to if you usually play with a gasless 1rax FE.  Therefore, be sure to cut all Marauder production until after your Starport has completed.
- Try not to take any huge engages against your Protoss opponent with your initial Medivacs unless you are sure you can do damage.  With only 2 Barracks producing units, and such a fast 3rd Command Center, your army is not designed to outright win the game  rather to further your economic and upgrade advantage in order to win the game at a later point.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because it gives you the economy and infrastructure on par with a Wings of Liberty style 1rax FE. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Not to mention the fact that you also get a ridiculously early Engineering Bay in order to kick start your Bio upgrades very early. This build also takes no detours and goes directly into Bio+Medivac play, so your Stim+Medivac aggression happens much sooner than if you go for early Widow Mines.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes, especially if you lose your Reaper.

This aggressive build hits your opponent with relentless harassment, either outright winning the game or giving you a considerable economic advantage before even entering the midgame. Also, with Widow Mine and Banshee play, this build force a lot of scans  giving you another sort of economic advantage going into the midgame.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your 1st Refinery so as to check whether your opponent is opening Reapers or not. Against a Reaper player, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe and try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or an expansion at your natural with your first Marines.

Your next scout will come with your Widow Mine Drop. With this drop you can check what your opponents opener is. Against a Banshee player, you can following through with the build and trying to out-micro him in Banshee vs Banshee harass, or you can cancel your banshee and start a Viking and Engineering Bay for a Turret to play safe. Against a Hellbat Dropping player, make a few more Widow Mines to position them defensively against any incoming drop as you use your Widow Mine Drop and incoming Banshee to out-harass him. Against a player going for a similar Widow Mine Drop, you can either pull back and try to defend or attempt to do more SCV damage with your drop than he does with his.

Finally, when your first Banshee starts its harass, you will get a good look at everything else your opponent is doing when trying to transition into the midgame. Keep an eye out for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either Marine/Tank or Mech play quite easily.

When transitioning into Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production early in order to have a safe defense and later strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use.
- Keep your eyes peeled for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop a drop or Banshee. Do NOT drop on top of an active Widow Mine.
- With your initial Widow Mine drop, avoid Turrets at all costs. The main purpose of the drop is to force multiple scans, with a side goal of dealing crippling economic damage.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that were already weakened by the initial drop before attacking any of the full health SCVs.
- If your opponent has a Missile Turret already set up in his mineral line, then do not worry. Instead, camping a Terrans production with a Widow Mine and several Marines can be just as effectiveespecially with the Banshee follow-up that hits soon after.
- Always favor keeping your Medivac and Banshee alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural. You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very strong, aggressive play style that opens up with unrelenting harassment before even entering the midgame. With a Widow Mine drop and Banshee follow-up, you can kill many SCVs and also force your opponent to scan often  giving you another type of economic advantage. Finally, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for opening with a 1/1/1 grants you the freedom to go into nearly anything.

However, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades. Also, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,Factory,Refinery,CallMule,SCV,Marine,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,Starport,WidowMine,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,WidowMine,Medivac,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnStarport,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,Banshee,CloakingField,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,Banshee,TechLabOnFactory,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:08 PM;

This gas first Banshee opener used by INnoVation and many other top level Korean Terrans opens with the fastest Cloaked Banshees possible. The Banshee(s) are used to stay safe against early attacks as well as harass your opponent, in order to get an economic advantage going into the midgame.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your Orbital Command to check whether or not your opponent is opening with Reapers. Against an opponent opening Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe; thus, you should try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or expanded at your natural with your first few Marines.

Sacrifice your hellion on 35 supply to get intel + allow yourself to get more scvs while supply depot is building.

Against another Banshee player, follow-up your first Banshee with a Raven (and then potentially Viking if extra anti-air is needed). Against a Hellbat dropping player, make a few Widow Mines to burrow defensively against any incoming drop, as you use several Banshees to out-harass him. Against a player going for a Widow Mine Drop, position your Marines defensively at home and be sure to have enough scans to deal with his Widow Mines. Building a Raven might be useful, but not until after you have 2 Banshees with which to harass your opponent.

Finally, be sure to keep an eye out on what midgame transition your opponent is doing. Look for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either all-in, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play quite easily.

For an all-in transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory and start Siege Tank production instantly. When you hit 2 or 3 Siege Tanks, grab all of your Marines (>20), your Banshees/Vikings, and attempt to break your opponents front with a slow siege push.

It is possible to go into Marine/Tank or Mech after a 3 Command Center follow-up if you are sure your opponent will not be going for any more early game pressure. Start a Raven in order to save enough minerals to afford 2 Command Centers and then transition into either Marine/Tank or Mech just as below.

When transitioning into macro Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production after you start a 2nd Command Center. That way you have enough defense early and later can have a strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use. Against 2rax Reaper, you should delay your Tech lab until your Factory has completed at least one Hellion. Otherwise you might straight up die before you even start your first Banshee.
- Watch for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop your Banshee as you enter your opponents base.  Cloak your Banshee as soon as you see any potential for burrowed Widow Mines.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that are undefended by a Turret. If you are transitioning to a 1/1/1 all-in, then be sure to target-fire Marines as well, for this directly strengthens your attack.
- Always favor keeping your Banshee(s) alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two. You can also repair a weakened Banshee at home with SCVs if you can keep it alive.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural.  You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This gas first Banshee build is an aggressive opener in TvT. Also, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for you are able to transition into an all-in, 3 Command Center play, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play. Also, this build requires a lot less APM than other TvT builds, so it can be very useful for lower league players.

However, this build is extraordinarily weak against early Reaper builds because you open with so few Marines. Also, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind your opponent in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades, especially if they open with a fast expansion. Finally, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,SCV,Factory,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,Refinery,SCV,Marine,Starport,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Hellion,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,LiftRaxFromTechLab,Marine,LandStarportOnTechLab,CloakingField,CallMule,Banshee,SCV,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,WidowMine,ReactorOnBarracks', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:08 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Harstem 1 gate FE to Blink-Colossus', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a 1gate FE, and transitions directly into both Blink and Colossi. With these two tools you can safely secure your main and natural from both frontal pushes and backdoor drops.

Benchmark: When your first Colossus finishes (@9:00ish), you should have 1 Colossus, 3 Stalkers, a Sentry, a Mothership Core, 2 Observers, and around 50 Probes.

Scouting

This build is a safe build that gets detection and a lot of early game Stalkers, so Probe scouting is unnecessary. Use your initial Stalkers to ward off any of your opponent?s Reaper(s) or scout the front of your opponent?s base if they are opening with a Command Center First.

Most of your scouting will come from your 2 Observers. Send the first directly to your opponent?s main in order to spot what infrastructure is being built. Send the second to a common attack or drop path so that you have vision of when your opponent is moving out.

Against early Widow Mine drops, position your units defensively and consider delaying Colossus production in favor of more Observers.

Transitions

With Blink, Colossus, and Observers, you should be able to safely secure your main and natural expansions. Against bio play, consider getting 4 or 5 more Gateways while continuing your upgrades and taking your 3rd base as soon as you are safe to.

Alternatively, you are also able to go for a 2 Base, +2 Blink Stalker/Colossus all-in with this build.  Simply get your Ground Weapons upgrades instead of Ground Armor, and throw down 7 more Gateways after you start your Colossus production in order to break your opponent with simply Stalkers and Colossi.

Tips

- Chronoboost your Nexii constantly in order to get an economic advantage.
- Use your initial Stalker(s) to ward off any opposing Reapers and/or take a Xel?Naga Watchtower to see a push coming.
- Position your Robotics Facility, Forge, and Twilight Council in a central location to prevent them from being killed during a drop.
- Your Observers are the main way you can position your army to adequately defend multi-pronged aggression ? replace them if they are scanned and lost.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with both Blink Stalkers and Colossi, rushing for all the tools you need to defend Terran aggression.  With strong upgrades and a mobile unit composition, this build allows you to enter the midgame ridiculously quickly.

This 2 base, Hatchery-tech Roach-Speedling all-in crushes through Void Ray-less Stargate or heavy Gateway Protoss openers, both out of a Gateway Expand or Forge Fast Expand.

Scouting

Send your first Overlord to scout your opponent?s natural wall to spot for a Forge Fast Expand or Gateway Expand, and then send it to a safe area for a later 7:00 scout.  Consider using your 2nd Overlord to guard your natural expansion against Cannon Rushes. Your next Overlords can be placed around your opponent?s main or natural base as backup scouts or for vision of their 3rd base.
Use your initial Zerglings to scout around the map for Probes and proxy Pylons. Keep a Zergling outside his front to scout for any early pokes, and avoid any Stalkers or the Mothership Core whenever possible.
The majority of your scouting will come from the Roach/Ling all-in. Note whether or not your opponent has opened with a Stargate, Robotics Facility, or Gateway-heavy army, and react accordingly.

Transitions

This build is a 2 base Roach/Ling all-in off of only 27 Drones, so there is no well defined transition. That being said, if the attack is not going well, be sure to pull back and keep your units alive, instantly resume Droning, and attempt to secure a third base and 3rd Queen.  Going for Lair and Roach Speed or Hydralisks is probably your best way to defend the inevitable counter-attack, but you might be too far behind (based entirely on how much damage your all-in did) for it to be enough.

Tips

- Be active on the map with your initial few Zerglings in order to deny vision of the fact that you do not have a 3rd Hatchery (and especially that you have mined more than 100 gas just for Metabolic Boost).
- Roaches take up a lot of supply, so be sure to start several Overlords BEFORE you need to make the 8 Roaches.
- During the all-in, keeping up on your injects so that you have enough Speedling reinforcements could be the difference between a close game and an easy slaughter.

Pros and Cons

This is a very strong 2 base all-in that uses Roach/Ling to crush your opponent before the midgame has even started. It also requires little scouting and little APM to perform well, so it is a great build for newer players to perform as well.
However, if your opponent spots your lack of third base early on, they should have enough time to wall off their natural with Photon Cannons if they opened with a FFE or get out enough Sentries if they opened with a Gateway Expand.

Build is extremely aggressive and start off aggressive early on as well. In this one the initial zealot and MSCore are sent directly to the zergs 3rd to do some harassment. The whole goal of this build is to keep the drone count as low as possible before doing the full immortal/sentry push and this is stage 1 of that goal. You send the zealot/MSCore to his 3rd to maybe pick off a drone or even a queen but also to force an early set of lings. Losing the zealot will be almost inevitable however do NOT lose the MSCore. That will make your little poke 100% not worth it. You may not always be able to do this push as sometimes the zerg will open gas early and will have speed out by this time, so make sure you're scouting to see exactly when the gas goes down.

Part 2 of the "keep the drones low" goal is with an early warp prism pressure. Most immortal/sentry all ins don't have this step in it, they just go right for the attack and let the zerg drone and make whatever he wants before the attack. This little drop of 1 immortal and 2 sentries (preferably behind the mineral line in an abusable location) forces even MORE things that aren't drones as well as allows you to kill a decent amount. If you're good with your micro as well you can keep the drop going by going into the main and doing a FF drop and warping in (as your first 4 gateways will be done at this time) however that option may not always be available. Also be sure to bring the MSCore with this drop, if things go terrible wrong you can always recall which is why it's important to not lose the MSCore in the initial poke.

All the while this pressure is happening you're going up to 3 immortals and 9 gateways and making a ton of zealot/sentry and moving across the map.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Gas First Cloakshee Expand With Mine Defence', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This gas first Banshee opener used by Polt and many other top level Korean Terrans opens with the fastest Cloaked Banshees possible. The Banshee(s) are used to stay safe against early attacks as well as harass your opponent, in order to get an economic advantage going into the midgame.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your Orbital Command to check whether or not your opponent is opening with Reapers. Against an opponent opening Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe; thus, you should try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or expanded at your natural with your first few Marines.

Your next scout will come with your Banshee. With this Banshee, you can check what your opponents opener is. Against another Banshee player, follow-up your first Banshee with a Raven (and then potentially Viking if extra anti-air is needed). Against a Hellbat dropping player, make a few Widow Mines to burrow defensively against any incoming drop, as you use several Banshees to out-harass him. Against a player going for a Widow Mine Drop, position your Marines defensively at home and be sure to have enough scans to deal with his Widow Mines. Building a Raven might be useful, but not until after you have 2 Banshees with which to harass your opponent.

Finally, be sure to keep an eye out on what midgame transition your opponent is doing. Look for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either all-in, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play quite easily.

For an all-in transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory and start Siege Tank production instantly. When you hit 2 or 3 Siege Tanks, grab all of your Marines (>20), your Banshees/Vikings, and attempt to break your opponents front with a slow siege push.

It is possible to go into Marine/Tank or Mech after a 3 Command Center follow-up if you are sure your opponent will not be going for any more early game pressure. Start a Raven in order to save enough minerals to afford 2 Command Centers and then transition into either Marine/Tank or Mech just as below.

When transitioning into macro Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production after you start a 2nd Command Center. That way you have enough defense early and later can have a strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use. Against 2rax Reaper, you should delay your Tech lab until your Factory has completed at least one Hellion. Otherwise you might straight up die before you even start your first Banshee.
- Watch for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop your Banshee as you enter your opponents base.  Cloak your Banshee as soon as you see any potential for burrowed Widow Mines.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that are undefended by a Turret. If you are transitioning to a 1/1/1 all-in, then be sure to target-fire Marines as well, for this directly strengthens your attack.
- Always favor keeping your Banshee(s) alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two. You can also repair a weakened Banshee at home with SCVs if you can keep it alive.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural.  You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This gas first Banshee build is an aggressive opener in TvT. Also, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for you are able to transition into an all-in, 3 Command Center play, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play. Also, this build requires a lot less APM than other TvT builds, so it can be very useful for lower league players.

However, this build is extraordinarily weak against early Reaper builds because you open with so few Marines. Also, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind your opponent in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades, especially if they open with a fast expansion. Finally, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,SCV,Factory,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,Refinery,SCV,Marine,Starport,TechLabOnFactory,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,LandStarportOnTechLab,Banshee,CloakingField,SCV,CallMule,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,WidowMine,SCV,Banshee,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:09 PM;

You use the zealot to help ferry the probe across the map and keep the pylon alive so you can get a zealot warp in and then have your oracle follow up afterwords. You either should target and timewarp the queens he has trying to defend the 3rd, and then clean them up with the oracle, or bait them all down and then go in to a queenless mineral line to get a ton of drone kills. It's all up to your judgement.

After that youcgo for very fast charge, archons, and +1 attack and then zealot/archon timing to kill the 4th base of the zerg. It hits at such an awkward time that the zerg never expects it and you're taking a 3rd behind it as well so they don't even think you're going to attack.

The other reason it's so good though is because zealot/archon at that stage in the game is probably the best unit comp per cost vs anything the zerg could have made. If they try to go formass lingsat that stage to hold off the zealot pressure, then zealot archon is obviously going to destroy that. If they go forhydrasthe count won't be high enough and as long as you can trap them with FF's you'll destroy them as well. If they goroachesthen you probably can't end them with this push, but if you can get good forcefields and get the zealots in the faces of the roaches then you'll do quite well since zealots are actually better vs roaches if they can get in their face (which is what charge + FF does). If they goswarm hostsyou'll hit right as they're popping usually so they'll be in quite low numbers. You can do a good amount of damage before you have to pull back to an observer from the robo you made while pushing. The only big trouble with this build is mutas, however like the swarm hosts you'll be hitting as they pop. With 3-4 archons and a wave of stalkers afterwords you can easily deal with low numbers of mutas. If they are able to get a good 12-13 at once you're gonna have to back up and immediately make 2 extra stargates and start phoenix production.

If you don't end the game with the zealot/archon push then you can simply transition into whatever tech is required vs what the zerg chose. You can start warp prisms with the robo you made and then go into colossus and blink, or you can make warp prisms and continue down TC path with storm and then add some void rays.

It's been done before but recently it's become very popular in Korea. So the idea behind this is that you get the best of both worlds. You get a very fast nexus for early eco as well as a fast gateway for early tech. Soit's basically like a gate FE combined with a nexus first. If you notice they're going for anearly poolthen you can justchrono zealots and do a kind of delayed gate FEand be fine, and if not then you just continue as normal being nice and greedy with your early nexus and tech.

After the opening then it's a super safe build since you get early sentries and 2 gates to wall off. You shouldn't really lose to any thing once you get the wall up. You then transition into a few more sentries and gates while taking a 3rd and youpressure him with sentry stalker. This part of the build is very similar to the old PartinG fake 3 base 7 gate build, however you're still macroing behind it.

The goal with this attack is to justforce units and make him think you're all inning(which you aren't) and if you catch him off guard you can definitely kill the 3rd. It's just to set up for the next attack that comes.

Transition to mid game

The transition is quite simple and the "in" thing to do right now. You simplyget +2 and blink and then attack. Basically every Korean protoss is doing this right now and it's winning games left and right. There's not really a good answer to this for zerg other than getting vipers which are easily dealt with by high templar. So with a critical mass of blink/sentry you can cut up roach/hydra indefinitely and you should be able to win whatever fight. It's also great for cutting up small spaces so you can snipe hatches better.

Whatever damage you did with the first push should give you a timing to hit with the 2nd push. So long as youdon't over commit and lose more than you should(recall when you think you're starting to lose too much) you should be in good shape.If they're super preparedthen you simplyuse the 2nd push as a pokeand threaten to kill him while you're simply macroing up on 3 bases going into templar tech and harassing with the warp prism.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'HerO greedy blink into DT drop', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'Early game opening

The build starts off very standard. It's a normal 1 gate FE blink opening. You get your twilight council on 29 supply after 1 stalker and then a 2nd stalker afterwords. Lately people have only been going 2 stalkers in the early game instead of 3 so that way they can fit in 2 gateways at 36 supply while opening blink as well. This would make it so that the 2 extra gates (3 in total) would be finished right when WG was done. Before that, literally everyone opened 3 stalkers but with a later 2nd and 3rd gate that didn't quite finish when WG was done. This build is a best of both worlds and what I assume might become the standard now for defensive blink openings. herO goes for a 2nd gate at 34 supply instead of 2nd and 3nd at 36, which allows him to still get the 3rd stalkerfrom the gateway. Then once WG is finished researching, he warps in 2 more to get that nice number of 5 which is what you would get normally anyway. So you basically end up at the same thing (just with 1 less gateway since you aren't planning on being super aggressive with the blink) but now with 3 stalkers early to help defend instead of 2. It's a small little variation, but a rather useful one to give you that nice defense of 3 stalkers before WG is finished while still ending up with a nicely timed tech and gateway count.

One other important thing to note: herO onlychronoboosts his blink research ONCE. Yeah...only once. That's very rare. He instead puts all chrono into his probes to get full saturation and simply waits for blink to finish. So basically you can completely focus on chronoing probes if you want. If you forget to chrono blink once it doesn't even matter cause apparently not even herO does that sometimes with this build.

Extra tech and mid game transition

With every defensive blink opener we need a robo right? Luckily for us, herO gets the timing for the robo down absolutely perfectly. Literally the earliest we could need an observer after a standard 1 rax reaper FE is around 8 minutes. When does the observer come out of this 6:35 timed robo? 8 minutes. This will allow you to defend any 1 rax reaper FE into factory builds with relative ease (as long as your control and map awareness are on point) and give you a strong edge going into the mid game.

All the while this is going on, a very sneaky and early timed dark shrine has been placed at 7:30. This is earlier than the Trap build I used in the past (which went down at about 8 minutes), which adds to the greediness of this build. This earlier dark shrine allows you to time up a nicely executeddual pronged attackwith7 stalkers and 3 DTs in a warp prism. This is showcased brilliantly vs Flash from Proleague. As you drop the DTs in, you also do some poking with the blink stalkers at the bunker or any SCVs near the front. Or you can do it visa versa. Distract and fake blink all in by poking at front bunker --> drop DTs into main. He continues doing this for quite a long time which allows him to do the next step in the build.

While this DT/blink harass is going on, herO makes some decisions that REALLY enforces the greedy aspect of the build. Not only does he get a robo bay AND two forges during the 8th minute, he also EXPANDS at 9:20.He is heavily relying on his blink/DT harass to scare of the Terran to allow him to get away with this.He even starts +1/+1 BEFORE a colossus. At 11 minutes into the game his unit count is literally 61 probes, 1 DT, 1 colossus, 7 stalkers, 1 warp prism and a MSCore. If the Terran makes a strong defense of the blink/DT harass then a counter attack is extremely lethal and potentially game ending. If you don't feel safe being this greedy, then by all means delay the 3rd base and get a few gates before hand while you get a colossus and a sentry or two. Most terrans will want to be attacking you more often than not so it's better to play a little safer on ladder anyway. This build obviously is being done this greedy due to the fact that herO is playing against Flash.

Late game

The build transitions quite easily into late game. After your 3rd is saturated you get a nice gateway explosion of up to about 12-14 or so. You start +2/+2 right when 1/1 is done and then a Templar Archives shortly after for storm. herO also gets warp prism speed for some random reason. I guess he just feels he has the money to get it so he does. I personally would prefer observer speed since it's a little more helpful (since warp prisms are fairly fast already now) and if you're going to spend your money on something like that at that point in the game, it might as well be for observer speed since it's so vital later on. However, from there it's a fairly standard PvT game. Not much changes because of the opener in terms of late game play.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,GoOutProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Nexus,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,WarpgateUpgrade,Chronoboost,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Probe,TwilightCouncil,Stalker,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Probe,Blink,Chronoboost,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Gateway,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,DarkShrine,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,Observer,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,RoboticsBay,WarpPrism,Forge,Forge,Pylon,Probe,Probe,WarpInDarkTemplar,WarpInDarkTemplar,WarpInDarkTemplar,Nexus,GroundWeaponsLevel1,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,GroundArmorLevel1,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Pylon,Pylon,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,ExtendedThermalLance,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:10 PM;

Since the ramp is so small you can easily forcefield it off and be slightly greedier with your opening (so long as your reaction times are good) and the phoenix cater to the large amount of drop area.

The build opens with a standard oracle for some harassment and scouting. Very normal and cool. It goes into a fast 5 phoenix after the oracle to further harass (if you want to reveal them) and also shut down drops early on to keep you safe to tech up to templar. HerO does both. I've seen him reveal them after 3 to start doing some harassment with the oracle (usually if they open delayed mines so you can pick up the mines and continue harassing) or he will keep them hidden like vs Polt (someone he knows loves his drops) so you can catch some medivacs for free.

After that you go into charge and an archon or two to get your 3rd up. This is going to be the hard part to stay stabilized. This is when terran will try to really pressure you to keep you off 3 bases and away from storm. This is why HerO gets a decent gateway count before taking the 3rd as you will need as many units as possible to keep them away and your 3rd safe.

Once the 3rd is set and you have storm you should have a decent time keeping terran back as you try a storm drop or two while you tech up to colossi as well to abuse any lack of vikings. I prefer to add a 2nd robo as well when the colossi tech up starts so that way you can really hit with a hard transition of suddenly 2 and suddenly 4 colossi instead of just getting one and slowly go up. It's much easier for terran to transition himself when you only do 1 colossus at a time so if you do double robo you can open a timing window for yourself if the terran isn't scouting/reacting properly.

The zealot/stalker poke at the beginning this time is more to focus down queens than anything else, even if you get the health on it low that's better than nothing because the plan is to follow up directly after with the oracle. An oracle beats a queen one on one, however it will have low health, so if you can lower the queens health initially you can snipe it very quickly with the oracle after and get some juicy drone kills. Or best case scenario you actually kill the queen with the zealot/stalker and you just get a crap ton of drone kills.

This part is quite micro intensive so I would suggest practicing the timings of this build vs the AI multiple times first so you can get the timings for all the gateways down.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Hero Aggresive Stargate', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a Gateway Expand and then transitions into light Gateway pressure in order to start the macro game with an economic advantage. Also, this build gets both a Stargate and a third base quite quickly for a Chargelot/Void Ray or pure Sky-toss unit composition in the late game.

Scouting

After the early game, be sure to scout for early Roaches from your opponent. If your opponent is performing an early 2 base all-in, then warp-in Sentries and make Void Rays from your Stargate instead of being aggressive with your initial 6 units. If your opponent has taken a third base or shows NO signs of aggression, then be sure to set up your proxy Pylon as soon as you can for the attack to hit before Zergling Speed can finish.

When you are attacking with your initial 6 units (2 Stalkers, 3 Zealots, and Mothership Core), your opponent must defend with whatever units he has. With this extra scouting information, be sure to react appropriately. If your opponent has opened with Roaches, then be sure to start Void Ray production earlier. If your opponent has opened without Zergling speed, then be sure to continue the 3gate attack, reinforcing with Zealots and Stargate units when you can. If your opponent has opened with Zergling speed, then be sure not to over-commit to the attack; rather, pull back and start your Stargate production appropriately. Also note that if you kill a Queen or two, you should reinforce with an Oracle first due to your opponent?s lack of anti-air.

Depending on how your attack has gone (especially if your opponent defended with opening fast Roaches), then you might not feel safe to take such a quick third Nexus. Instead, start a Forge and a few Cannons at your natural in order to play safe.

Transitions

This build is a macro build, so don?t commit multiple warp-ins to the initial 3gate attack unless you are confident in its success. Following up with the appropriate Stargate units and taking your 3rd Nexus/extra Assimilators is much more important than dealing a killing blow with these units.

HerO follows up this attack with a Forge and several Cannons at both his natural expansion and 3rd Nexus. He then starts 2 more Stargates and both Assimilators at his 3rd Nexus in order to make a mass Void Ray army. With his economic advantage, he ensures that no standard Roach/Hydra timing attacks can kill his Sky-toss army until it is already too powerful.

However, it is also possible to play with an sOs style transition, favoring mass Chargelot and only several Void Rays in order to make a beefier ground army.  Again, start a Forge (or two) for Cannons at the natural expansion and 3rd Nexus as well as for Ground Upgrades. Then start at least 4 Gateways for a healthy Gateway count and a Twilight Council to begin Zealot Charge before taking your 5th and 6th Assimilators at your 3rd Nexus.  Add in High Templar/Archons instead of more Void Rays as your gas count allows it.

Tips

- Because this is a macro build with only light pressure, commit almost all of your chronoboost on both your Nexus throughout the build.
- With your initial Stalkers, be sure to clear any stray Zerglings around your base that might scout your build. Then defend the building proxy Pylon until your first warp-in.
- As soon as you start your Stargate, you need to send out a Probe in order to set up an aggressive proxy Pylon
- During your 3gate attack, use your Stalkers to target-fire any Queens your opponent might use to defend with. If you can kill a Queen or two, then follow-up with an Oracle to deal a lot of damage. Also, be sure to use Time Warp on any Queens or Roaches so as to minimize your opponent?s mobility in the fight.
- Do NOT over-commit multiple warp-ins to the 3gate attack unless you are confident that you can do damage. Each warp-in that you use slows down your 3rd Nexus timing by at least 20 seconds.
- If your opponent defends with fast Roaches, then consider starting a Forge and several Cannons at your natural expansion before you take the 3rd Nexus.

Pros and Cons

This macro build is strong because it opens with some light aggression for harassment and scouting, while taking a rather quick 3rd Nexus behind it. Also, it is a safe Gateway Expand build because your 3gates and Stargate together are enough to defend most early Zerg all-ins. Finally, this build uses a Stargate for some decent harassment, a deterrent for Mutalisks, and an opening for a strong unit-composition in the midgame.

However, this build requires solid macro while simultaneously performing a timing attack, so may be quite hard for newer players. Also, this build is somewhat weak against a Zerg who takes minimal losses during the 3gate attack and is able to follow-up with a +1/+1 mass Speedling attack to kill your 3rd Nexus.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Nexus,MothershipCore,WarpgateUpgrade,Pylon,Stalker,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Stargate,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Phoenix,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,VoidRay,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Nexus', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:10 PM;

You then go up to 10 gates in total (4 starting, 2 at 3rd, 4 at 10:00) and a robo to round out your composition. The oracle should keep him back for a bit in the early game as well as give you enough information to know exactly what kind of follow up he is going for. The 4gates before 3rd and 6 sentries off of them will give you a nice defense vs early roach and or ling play to try and cancel your 3rd. Sometimes you'll have to give it up, however with the proper response (shown in one of the linked VODs) you can still end up winning.

The cool thing about this build is how versatile it is. Like I said, it has early pressure (which most fast +2 blink builds don't) while still being able to defend at home with sentries.

It' requires some decent multitasking as well as a good understanding on how to play the mass harass style vs swarm hosts.

Otherwise if they just kind of sit back and macro in a non swarm host way, then you just do some harass with the blink/sentry squad and warp prisms while going up to colossi anyway.

Like I said it's a bit challenging butif you want you can just incorporate the main ideasof the build into your own standard robo openings that you're familiar and comfortable with. The build starts with a fancy 2 gas opener with probes being rallied in 1 at a time after you have full mineral saturation. If anyone remembers a long time ago the SaSe aggressive 3 gate opening that Day9 did a daily on, it's very similar to how the gasses were filled in that build. Whether or not it's better to do it this way or to just do a normal 2 in each or 1 with 3, I don't really know. I'm sure you can get to the same out come with whatever gas opener you're familiar with but if you wanna be try hard and feel cool then go ahead and try this method. I personally found it quite smooth when I tried it.

Now the build starts with a normal robo timing just like any other standard opening. The natural gasses are a bit earlier however since the build is quite gas intensive (you'll also need the extra gas for 2 sentries while teching up heavily to be able to defend). That's another thing you can simplify if you'd like if you don't think you'll remember to fill the gas up later on. Once the robo bay is done you'll get your first colossus but instead of getting range you get warp prism speedto aid in your colossus drop harassment. Since we aren't committing fully to colossus we won't need range this early and instead we put that gas towards a fast twilight council to go into storm for a 2nd form of harassment in the storm drop.

Once your harassment with the colossus starts you should be getting a few extra gateways to prepare for any medivac timing the terran may want to use. Your extra resources should also be put into some immortals while you wait for your tech to get up. You should also be sure towarp in 2 HT's when you start storm so by the time storm is done you can immediately go and use them for the storm drop.So once storm is done, bring the colossus home and switch it for the HT's and go for round 2 of your wonderful harassment. You can also warp in archons at home to help defend and bolster your army. You'll have quite the beefy army with immortals and archons and storm with 1 colossus. If you remember the old rangeless colossus into storm builds, this is very similar to that except that you're doing harassment with the first colossus.

From the storm drop you simply add on more gates as you feel necessary and get the upgrades and charge going and transition into a normal macro game. You get your 3rd when you feel safe and you can transition into 2 robo colossi whenever you feel comfortable to throw the terran off even more.

If you feel the colossus drop into storm drop is a little too much for you (opening storm these days isn't always the easiest thing in the world) then you can very easily just continue down the colossus tech route.The extra resources you will bank by not going twilight tech can be used for earlier gateways or earlier double forge. Or you can go into twilight still and go for blink for an easier drop defense option.

Something else you can do is do a big7gate colossus all in like Classic did vs Polt on Nimbus at Blizzcon.

If you still want to go down the storm route but feel like you're kind of skimping on defense by loading your first to HT's to do a drop, then you can also easily justplay more passive after the colossus drop.You can play it like the old rangeless colossus into storm builds like I mentioned and wait for the terran to sac a little bit into your unexpected storm transition. At that point you should feel more safe to incorporate some storm drops into your play.

Again, while this may not be the most solid or perfect build, it is a way to freshen up your games and force you to try some fun early game harassment that normally you aren't able to do. So even if you can't follow the build perfectly,at least try out some of the ideas in itand incorporate them into your own builds.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GoOutProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,Probe,GasProbe,Nexus,GasProbe,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,WarpgateUpgrade,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Stalker,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Observer,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Observer,RoboticsBay,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,WarpInStalker,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,GraviticDrive,WarpInSentry,Pylon,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInSentry,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpPrism,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,TwilightCouncil,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Forge,Probe,Probe,Nexus,Pylon,Pylon,Immortal,TemplarArchives,GroundArmorLevel1,Charge,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,PsionicStorm,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,WarpInHighTemplar,WarpInHighTemplar,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,WarpInHighTemplar,WarpInHighTemplar,PhotonCanon,PhotonCanon,PhotonCanon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:10 PM;

If he scouts early and sees your proxy, you should go with the first zealot otherwise he's going to have more than enough time to prepare for the 2nd one. If he doesn't scout and you can get 2 zealots out then wait for the 2nd one so that way it still hits with a surprise but has the ability to deal twice the damage. From there you should chrono out as many stalkers as you feel necessary. If you think you're pressure is being held easily then stop making them and focus on a transition back home. If you are dealing a lot of damage then continue chronoing them out.

Back home herO goes for 2 more gates for even more aggression once warp gate is done (and ends up winning the game with it) as well as a robo for protection vs DTs and for a stable follow up if the 3gate follow up does not kill him.

The reason for robo over anything else is because:

He saw a twilight council so the threat of DTs is there. Also his twilight would be too late for blink vs blink so going for immortals is safer.Stargate always has the possibility of losing to DT and blink (especially since blink is so common now and a common follow up to a held proxy)DT is too easily expected after a failed proxy

So robo is the safest option. If you scout certain things like a stargate or robo then going for blink or oracle respectively will obviously be good in those situations.

The cool thing about this build as well since it's less all in, is that if it gets scouted you can easily transition out of it and harass with an immortal drop or a sentry drop in the main and FF the ramp. This is because of the fact that you actually get the natural gasses.

Just a few things you have to remember about this build is that you have to be aware of speedling all ins. This is because your natural wall off is going to be a bit later than most builds, so you want to be sure that nothing is hitting you before you can get it down. If needed you can wall off quicker if you see something coming.

Also make sure you hide your robo fairly well. If a zerg sees that fast of a robo they're going to expect something so it's best to hide it as much as possible.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'HuK 5gate Warp Prism Attack', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with 2 Stalkers and a Mothership Core to take map control, and then follows up with a Warp Prism and 5 Gateways to drop the main of your opponent and force field him out of his own base.

Benchmark: When your Warp Prism finishes (@7:05ish), you should have around 32 Probes, 2 Stalkers, 4 Sentries, 1 Warp Prism, and a Mothership Core.

Scouting

This build is most effective against gasless openers from Terran, and quite ineffective against 1 base plays. Thus, be sure that you confirm your opponent doing a Reaper FE, CC First, or 1rax FE build with either your Probe scout at 13 supply or with your initial Stalker poke. If your opponent has not opened with an expansion, then abandon the Warp Prism and go instead for 2 more Assimilators, a Robotics Bay, double Forge, and standard macro PvT play. If your opponent has opened with an expansion, then proceed with this build and be sure to force field your opponent out of his main base.

Transitions

This build is a strong, 5 gate attack off of 2 bases with only 2 Assimilators.  Thus, you have to damage with this attack if you want to go into the midgame with an advantage. Assuming you do no damage and you lose the Warp Prism, you will have a very hard time coming back in the game, and should play stupidly greedy if you want a chance to come back. If you do some damage with this build but eventually lose everything, then you might still be in the game; transition by getting both Assimilators at your natural and go into a standard Colossi/Forge midgame. If you do a lot of damage and save some of your army with the Warp Prism, then you can feel free to take a greedy third base instantly while transitioning directly into Colossi+upgrades off of double Forge.

Tips

- Use your initial Stalkers and Mothership Core for map control and early game scouting. Only build the Warp Prism if you are playing against an expanding Terran. Get your natural?s Assimilators and go into Colossi if you see your opponent staying on one base.
- Against Reaper play, keep at least one Stalker at home in order to defend your Probes and/or stop him from seeing your Warp Prism.
- When you finish your Warp Prism, load up your 4 Sentries instantly and head directly for your opponent?s main base.
- Poke your opponent?s front with your Stalkers before you go into the main with your Warp Prism to make sure that your opponent has all his units at his natural.
- Drop your Sentries on the high ground near your opponent?s ramp to instantly force field him out.
- Transform your Warp Prism into Phasing Mode and constantly warp-in 5 units at a time, favoring Zealots and Sentries.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with your Stalkers/Mothership Core to easily defend Reapers as well as take map control. Then, with the scouting intel that your Probe and Stalker poke give you, you follow up with a very early Warp Prism and 5 gate attack in order to drop in your opponent?s main while you force field him out. Against a non-expand build, you have the Robotics Facility and can get Observers or Immortals to play safe.

However, opening with this build delays your midgame tech by a lot. By only staying on 2 Assimilators, you do not have the gas income to go into Colossi instantly, and thus have to rely on your Warp Prism doing damage to get a leg up on your opponent. Also, this build relies a lot on early game scouting in order to ensure that your opponent is going for a standard expansion into Bio play.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,MothershipCore,Stalker,Chronoboost,Probe,Nexus,Probe,RoboticsFacility,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Chronoboost,WarpPrism,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpInSentry,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInSentry,WarpInSentry,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:10 PM;

This build opens with 5 Stalkers to apply pressure to your opponent and scout for what they?re opening.  It then follows up with a Stargate Expand, allowing you to reactively counter your opponent?s opening tech.

Benchmark: When you Stargate finishes (@6:30ish), you should have 24 Probes, 5 Stalkers, and a Mothership Core.

Scouting

Because of how low on minerals you are, you cannot afford to Probe scout.Thus, all of your scouting comes from your Stalkers.

Being active with your initial 3 Stalkers around your natural, third, and watchtower will prevent your opponent from sneaking proxy Pylons past you and hitting you with a very fast Gateway unit attack. Also, with your mobile army, you can head directly at your opponent in order to scout what units they have made and even attack them if they are attempting to expand quickly.  Your 5 Stalkers (with high ground vision from your Mothership Core) must scout what your opponent is doing, so that you can react accordingly with your Stargate in the midgame.

- If your opponent is fast expanding, then produce an Oracle from your Stargate and attempt to pressure the front with your Stalkers as your Oracle does damage in the main.
- If your opponent has multiple Sentries out, then attempt to bust up the ramp with your Stalkers to force him to use Force Fields to defend his ramp. The most likely scenario is that your opponent is making a Robotics Facility behind their Sentry count. However, it is also possible that your opponent is making a Stargate instead.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then make an Oracle or two and keep them in their base by threatening to kill multiple workers if they leave.
- If your opponent has a Stargate of their own, make constant Phoenix and position your units very defensively to deal with early Oracles.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then make one Oracle to stay defensive with in case of DTs. Afterwards, you can make up to 3-4 Phoenix for map control and harass potential, but quickly transition into Void Ray/Immortal to stay safe against Blink play.

Transitions

This build transitions into a macro game very easily. However, the actual unit composition of that macro game very often depends completely on what build your opponent has chosen to open with. If your opponent stays on one base for too long, then throw down more Gateways, constantly make units, and prepare to defend your natural with Void Rays, Stalkers, (possibly Immortals), and your Planetary Nexus. In Stargate vs Stargate macro games, quickly go up to 2 Stargates constantly making Phoenix and get a Fleet Beacon for the Phoenix Range upgrade. In Stargate vs Robotics macro games, use your Phoenix or Oracles to get an economic advantage, while transitioning into Sky-toss or a Phoenix/Blink all-in. In Stargate vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponent?s potential Blink or Dark Templar harass, as you transition to Void Ray/Immortal for defense or pure Sky-toss.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very safe build that gets quick map control with 5 Stalkers early on for safety, aggression, and scouting. With accurate scouting information, it then transitions into Stargate play and expands so that you can play a reactive macro game with a strong economy.

When you are out on the map with your first Stalkers, however, your opponent might sneak an Oracle into your main base. Be careful that you are only aggressive when you can be aggressive and only use your Stalkers for scouting when you cannot be aggressive.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'HyuN 12 Roach Opener', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This 12 Roach Rush is a timing attack designed to cripple a Terran economy, transitioning into a further all-in or macro play as needed.

Scouting

There is only minor scouting necessary with this build before you hit your opponent with your 12 Roaches. Simply ensure that your opponent is not cheesing you with an 8-8-8 opener or proxy 11/11 Rax.
Once you are committed in the attack, be on the look-out for signs that your opponent is going for a full-on macro play (3 Command Centers), some sort of Hellbat aggression (Armory), some sort of Banshee play (Techlabbed Starport), or normal Bio play (multiple Barracks). Your upcoming transition requires you to both do some damage and later handle any counter attack potential from your opponent without losing much yourself.

Transitions

Depending on what you are most comfortable with and what you scout your opponent doing, you can transition into a later all-in or macro play yourself. Note that regardless of whichever path you follow, you will have to do some amount of damage with your attack or you will be behind both in terms of economy and tech.
If you are transitioning into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk play, stop all Roach production, and get a Lair, Metabolic Boost, and 2 Evolution Chambers as soon as possible. Getting Mutalisks out to defend 3 bases from drops as you tech towards +2/+2 Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk with all the necessary upgrades is how you?ll get ahead in the midgame.
If you are transitioning into a Roach based midgame, try to avoid making many more Roaches after your initial 12 roach opener. Instead, focus on securing 3 Hatcheries, 2 Evolution Chambers, and teching for a Speed Roach/Speed Hydra midgame (with potentially Swarm Host/Viper lategame).
If you are transitioning into another all-in, your best best is some sort of Roach based army with splash damage (such as a Roach/Bane all-in). Do note that any follow-up all-in will be particularly weak against Banshee or Widow Mine defenses.

Tips

- As you get to your first 100 Gas, if there is still a scout in your main base, consider fake researching Metabolic Boost. Be sure to cancel if before you get to 28 supply and need to start your Roach Warren.
- Don?t over-commit to making Roaches. Only make 12 and then be sure you are getting the necessary 2 base economy, Overlord count, and creep spread back at home while your attack is commencing.
- The point of the attack is to cripple your opponent, but if the attack does not go too well, there is no retreat; your follow-up depends largely on your ability to scout what your opponent has opened with and react/defend accordingly.

Pros and Cons

This aggressive build can outright defeat opponents that are macroing too hard or do not scout and react adequately. Opening with 12 Roaches gives your early game a muscle that not many other ZvT builds give you, giving you great denial of any Reaper/Hellion openers as well.
However, this build does put you behind both in terms of economy and tech if your attack does not do damage.

This macro build order opens with a quick 3 Hatchery opening to get a strong economy and then transitions into a Tech-heavy army in order to stay safe against early attacks and lay on the aggression to Protoss before the late game starts. This build maxes out on Roach/Hydra/Viper in order to crush your opponent?s army or deny their 3rd/4th base.

Scouting

Scout with either Overlords, Zerglings, Overseer, or Changelings when your Hydralisk Den goes down. Send them into either the main base or the 3rd base in order to see if Protoss is going for a tech-heavy composition (Colossus/Void Ray/etc) or a Chargelot-heavy composition. If they are going for a Chargelot heavy composition, instantly throw down a Banelings Nest, start Baneling Speed, and max out with around 16 Banelings in your unit composition.
Besides this, all mid and late game scouting comes from the Roach/Hydra/Viper pokes or attacks that you will perform. React appropriately by either re-maxing with Ultras or Swarm Hosts. You will need a 5th base to fully support any Hive-tech re-maxes.

Transitions

There is no ?transition? per se. If you can win the game with this push, then be sure to attack in an open position, use Blinding Cloud or Abduct appropriately, and take the game quickly. If you cannot win the game outright, then fall back on your 4/5 base economy and tech switch to whatever best counters your opponent?s army. Note that you should get a lot of static defense in order to stay safe during your super late game tech switches between Mutalisks, Swarm Hosts, and Ultralisks.

Tips

- If your first Overlord scouts your opponent going for a Gateway expand, then you should abandon getting the third base, instead getting an Extractor and starting Metabolic Boost before taking your 3rd.
- If your natural gets Pylon blocked, then you can make an early Overlord at 15 supply instead of the Hatchery in order to buy some time against it. If your opponent lets the Pylon finish, then simply making 4-6 Zerglings to take the Pylon down should be enough of a commitment before returning back to the build.
- Being thorough about checking for early proxy Pylons across the map with your early game Zerglings is crucial against early Protoss timings. Being able to spot aggression and stop it before it can even begin is the easiest way to avoid quick losses.
- Be sure you send in an Overlord scout at 7:00. Spotting your opponent?s midgame tech informs your next step with this build(whether it be more Drones, a Hydralisk Den, or Spore Crawlers).
- Vipers will be usable (Consume finishes) 3:30 after your Infestation Pit starts.
- Scouting for a heavy Chargelot composition before you max can be quite important. Throwing down a Banelings Nest and maxing with several Banelings can be the difference between a quick loss and a sure win.
- Once you have re-maxed on Ultras, starting a Spire and tech-switching between Mutalisks and Swarm Hosts/Ultras is a strong way to win in the very late game. Also note that you should get a lot of static defense when performing these late game tech switches.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a hugely economic opening while still being safe. It then transitions into a Viper-based defense in order to secure your 4th base and quickly max out on Roach/Hydra/Viper.
This build however requires constant scouting in order to be safe.

Designed specifically to kill most Protoss players during the mid game Templar transition, INnoVations SCV pull hits at around 14 minutes with MMM, Vikings, SCVs, and 2/1 upgrades.

Scouting

The first ten minutes of the game is a standard TvP Reaper FE, so scouting and reactions proceed as normal.

First, SCV scout, 15 supply at the latest, to see if you are being 10 gate Zealot rushed. Then follow up with your Reaper scout, checking pylon count, assimilator count, gas mined, and MSC/Stalker/Nexus timing.

Your early Engineering Bay allows for equally early Missile Turrets, so you should be able to build a turret in your main base and position marines in your natural mineral line in the event of an Oracle attack.

Against a delayed Protoss expansion (4:10+, no Nexus), always build a bunker.

Against a fast expanding Protoss, poke with your first Marauder and 8-10 Marines to force overcharge and to gauge his army size.

This initial poke will reveal the following possibilities:

- Little to no Gateway units: Possible double forge (proceed as normal) or Dark Templars (build turrets and bank one scan minimum).
- No obvious Observers: Confirm Twilight tech. If your opponent is going for Templar instead of Colossus, immediately abandon the build and do a biomine parade style using a reactored Factory and five barracks before your third Command Center. SCV pulls are a poor choice against Pisonic Storm.
- More Stalkers then usual: Possible Blink Stalker aggression. React accordingly with bunkers and mines. Consider hiding your small poke squad at his third or fourth, and counter attacking when he moves all his stalkers and his MSC to your side of the map.
- Phoenixes: Phoenix Colossus is by far the most likely choice, but constantly scout to see if the Colossus count is rising. If it remains at one or two for very long, be cognizant of the possibility of a feint into Templars.
- Healthy Gateway unit count: Proceed as normal.

These above are only a few examples, but the most common. Against most styles that involve Colossus (single forge, double forge, blink colossus, phoenix colossus, etc) you will be able to simply play as normal and execute the all in without any problems.

For lower level players, please be advised all scouting reactions as written above are general assumptions made against players attempting optimal strategies. You will be blindsided by sub optimal and often illogical strategies quite often, but you should be able to compensate with superior macro and mechanics.

Transitions

As with any all-in, there is no transition unless you have done a significant amount of damage.

If your attack fails, there is no transition; you will die almost immediately to any counter attack, or you will be contained to two bases and slowly starve to death.

If your attack succeeds in mostly destroying Protosss army, but you cannot finish off your opponent, retreat and rally defensively. Continue your upgrades, maintain consistent worker production, and add a third command center and a Ghost Academy, if necessary.

Tips

The main objective of this push is to successfully engage and destroy his army decisively. Your SCVS are there to absorb just enough Colossus volleys to allow your Vikings to destroy all the AOE and your MMM to shoot through the Gateway buffer.

Again, to emphasize, your objective is to destroy his army decisively, not to destroy his third, or his natural, or snipe any tech. You are to take one crushing victory with your army before beginning to do any eco or tech damage.

During the actual engagement, be sure to have your SCVs in front of your main army. Attack in as wide of a concave as you can form, and make sure that your Vikings are shift A-clicked across his Colossus.

Do not attempt any drops or secondary attacks. Your attack needs to be as strong as possible along a single front for the highest chance of success.

Pros and Cons

The first ten minutes of this build, as mentioned above, are identical to a standard Reaper FE, making this a particularly tricky all in to scout. Additionally, this build has the benefit of blind countering some two base Colossus all-ins because it gets Vikings so quickly, and in such high numbers.

That being said, just as with any all-in, if scouted and identified, this build loses a lot of its potency. A faster than normal Templar transition and increased Sentries for force fields are both popular and effective responses against scouted SCV pulls.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,EngineeringBay,GasScv,GasScv,DoubleMarines,SCV,Barracks,SCV,DoubleMarines,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SCV,CallMule,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,TechLabOnBarracks,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,StimPack,Marauder,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,Factory,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marauder,CallMule,SCV,SCV,InfantryArmorLevel1,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Starport,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnFactory,DoubleMarines,Marauder,SCV,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SupplyDepot,Refinery,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,CombatShield,SupplyDepot,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMarines,CallMule,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,Armory,CallMule,Barracks,Barracks,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,DoubleMedivacs,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,ConcussiveShells,SCV,SCV,CallMule,TechLabOnBarracks,ReactorOnBarracks,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,InfantryWeaponsLevel2,SupplyDepot,CallMule,Marauder,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleVikings,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,Marauder,Starport,CallMule,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleVikings,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,CallMule,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Viking,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleVikings,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Marauder,CallMule,Marauder,Marauder,Viking,DoubleVikings', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:10 PM;

Then it follows up with a quick 3rd Command Center to get a leg up against a macro-oriented Protoss opponent.

Scouting

This macro build is a greedy build, so scouting for all-ins is important.  However, you cannot afford to (nor have any need to) scout with an SCV before 17 supply. When you get to your opponents base, check whether they have a natural expansion started at or before the 5 minute mark. If your opponent has not started a Nexus by around the 5 minute mark, and they have both gas geysers, then you can assume they are performing an all-in with either a Twilight Council or Stargate. Be prepared to delay your 3rd Command Center in favor of 2 more Bunkers at the front (or main if your opponent appears to be doing a Blink all-in) and/or a Turret per mineral line to deal with Oracles.

All of the midgame scouting will come from you pushing out and taking the middle watchtowers, attacking the front, and dropping the main once you have Medivacs out. Simply noticing what units and unit composition your opponent is using to defend should give you enough information about their midgame plans to make informed counters.

Transitions

Because of how much infrastructure and time has been spent on Bio play in this build, the only possible follow up is going for more Bio play and adding in Vikings+Ghosts (and Hellbats or Widow Mines for the late game) as you take more bases.

To transition into standard Bio play, get another Engineering Bay and an Armory to continue double upgrades, add-on a Reactor and Tech lab onto your 4th/5th Barracks, get all of your third bases Refineries, and throw down either a Ghost Academy or a 2nd Starport depending on whether your opponent is going for Colossi or High Templar.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong build because of the powerful economy you kick start with your initial CC First and quick third. Also, by avoiding early Widow Mine drops or harassing units and focusing completely on getting upgrades and Bio, your army is considerably stronger at the 10 minute mark than most other TvP builds. Finally, this build is strong because you get a fast Engineering Bay and excess minerals, and thus have the opportunity to throw down Bunkers/Turrets to deal with any sort of 1 base aggression that a Protoss player can throw at you.

However, this build is only safe if your scouting is effective. Misjudging that your opponent is going for a macro game instead of an all-in can cost you the game instantly. Also, there is no opportunity with this build to apply pressure before you finish Stim and Medivacs at the 10 minute mark because it is focused on economy instead of pressure.

Tips

- The main strength of this build is the economic advantage. Do NOT miss SCVs as you are taking bases and macroing up.
- You cannot afford to scout before 17 supply in order to afford the CC and Barracks on time, but scouting what your opponent is doing in the early game is crucial, so be sure to send an SCV to scout soon after you reach 17 supply.
- Build another Bunker or two at the front if a scan or your SCV scout finds that your opponent has not started an expansion around the 5 minute mark.
- If you are playing completely blind, build a Missile Turret in each mineral line to defend against the possibility of Oracles before they could possibly arrive.
- Once you have Stimpack and Medivacs, push out instantly to try and deny a third base from your opponent and/or get scouting information about what midgame tech choice your opponent is committing to. However, keep in mind that you are on 3 Orbitals, and so remember that your economy is far ahead, but your army supply is not.

This CC First build gets a ridiculously fast 3rd Command Center, taking your economy immediately into the midgame. Using Reactor Hellions for map control and scouting information, this build is also reasonably safe; your Hellions let you quickly react to any Zerg all-in and Widow Mines + 3 Orbitals provides a reasonable defense.

Scouting

Instead of worrying about early game Zerglings, Innovation just builds his Command Center on the high ground, and finishes a wall-off with the initial Barracks. Thus, Innovation does not scout at all until his first Hellions pop.  With these Reactor Hellions he takes map control, clears out any Zerglings at watchtowers, and pokes Zergs front to spot the Zergs third base, any buildings at the front, and any units that Zerg is making.

- If you see a ton of Speedlings, then make sure your Hellion micro is on point. Feel free to pull back behind your natural wall in order to more effectively deal with Speedlings.
- If you see Roaches, then immediately cut Reactor Hellion production and start making Widow Mines two at a time. Make a Marauder, and consider cutting SCVs in order to complete a wall-off at your natural and prevent your opponent from running past your Bunker/Widow Mines.
- If you see two Evolution Chambers, then assume your opponent is playing a macro game.
- Alternatively, if you see a third base, then you can also assume your opponent is playing a macro game.

After any early pressure is spotted or not spotted, lift off your third Command Center and take your third. Use your Hellions and Marines (now with Stim) to secure it. All mid-game scouting will come from your incoming push with your first Medivacs.

Transitions

This build transitions well into both Marine/Tank or Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine because it sets up the basic infrastructure needed for either of those and gets Stim, +1/+1, and Combat Shields. Its infeasible to transition into Mech because of how much infrastructure and time you have already committed to into Bio upgrades.

For either transition, secure your third base, take both Refineries at your third, start +2/+2, and produce a lot of Marines. When transitioning into Marine/Tank, start a Tech lab on your Factory as well as a second Factory to kick start your Siege Tank count. When transitioning into Bio/Widow Mine, produce a Reactor on your Factory and start cranking out Widow Mines as you abuse your mobile Marine/Medivac force to apply pressure to your opponent. A +2/+2 timing attack with several Siege Tanks or several Widow Mines, and a lot of Marines is a very strong timing to hit.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a ridiculously economic opener  CC First into 3 CC.  However, this build gets Reactored Hellions quite quickly in order to take map control as well as stay safe against early Speedling timings. Also, your Hellions are quite useful in terms of the scouting information they give you.

However, this build is somewhat weak to early Roaches.

This build opens with a 9 Pool in order to apply a lot of early pressure to your opponent and keep them on one base, and then transitions into more macro oriented play with a Speedling follow-up.

Scouting

All of your scouting comes from your initial Overlords and your 10 Zerglings.  First scout where your opponent has spawned by sending your Overlord directly to one of the possible bases. Then use your first 6 Zerglings (with more rallied) to poke/prod your opponent?s base.
If you see your opponent?s natural Hatchery nearly done, then they have performed a Hatchery First opener and you can choose either to ignore the natural and attack their workers in the main or to focus exclusively on the natural and plan to bring it down. Note that you MUST do economic damage one way or another with your 10 Zerglings or you will fall behind economically.
If your opponent?s natural Hatchery is only just started, then they have performed a Pool First opener. Focus on canceling the natural Hatchery ? you won?t be able to do much damage in the main before their Spawning Pool finishes.
If your opponent does not have a natural, then go up into the main and check their gas count. Prepare against 1 base play of either Banelings or Roaches by focusing much more on Speedlings and potentially getting a Spine Crawler.

Transitions

You can use this opener to transition into any form of Zerg play. If you want to end the game immediately, you can put Drones back on gas and go for a 1 base Ling/Bane all-in.
More standard play ensues by starting your natural expansion as soon as possible and making only as many Speedlings as needed to be safe and have map control. For a Roach midgame, start a Roach Warren and Lair after your first 100 gas. Then, on 3 gasses, you can start Roach Speed and +1 Attack. For a Mutalisk midgame, get a Lair with your first 100 gas and saturate your 2 bases and 4 gasses as soon as possible. Start your Spire as soon as your Lair finishes.

Tips

- Attack his Drones in his main if he has performed a Hatchery First opener
- Attack his natural expansion if he has gone for a Pool First opener
- Scout his main if he has gone for a 1 base build
- Do NOT make too many Zerglings. It may seem tempting to try and kill your opponent with constant reinforcements, but slow Zerglings lose their effectiveness very quickly. Drones are much more important.
- Be sure to pull off of gas once you have mined 100 for Metabolic Boost. You need all of your Drones mining minerals in order to boost your economy into the midgame.

Pros and Cons

This build opens up with a 9 Pool in order to situate aggressively in a matchup known for its early game volatility. It also gets Metabolic Boost at a standard time, while still allowing for both macro or all-in transitions.
However, this build is obviously a lot less economical than most other ZvZ builds, so you must do some sort of economic damage with your initial 10 Zerglings or risk falling behind.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,CancelExtractor,Drone,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Queen,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,MetabolicBoost,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Overlord,InjectLarva', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:11 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'INnoVation Reaper-Hellion 3CC', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

Invented by Flash but refined and popularized by INnoVation, this Reaper/Hellion 3CC variant is by far the most popular on ladder and is considered by the majority of Terran players to be the most standard of macro builds. Its versatility has stood the test of time, and the current version below will be continually updated as INnoVation continues to optimize it again and again.

Scouting

You can open with this build regardless of what your opponent is doing, so SCV scouting is unnecessary. You only need to SCV scout if you want to confirm that your opponent is opening Hatchery First and want to start a Bunker at their natural in order to begin Reaper/Bunker pressure.

The rest of your scouting will come from your Reapers and then later Reaper+Hellions poking the front and forcing your opponent to reveal what units they have in order to defend your attacks. Note: Ling Speed will finish around 3 minutes after your opponent takes an Extractor. Thus, if your initial SCV/Reapers see your opponent taking gas, be sure to send your Reapers back just before those 3 minutes are up and wait for some Hellions before attempting to engage Speedlings in the open field.

In case your Reapers or Hellions spot your opponent making Roaches or going for a Roach Warren, immediately cancel your next pair of Hellions and begin making Widow Mines and Marauders. Having your Widow Mines positioned effectively, and using SCVs to tank damage or repair your Bunker will be all you need to stay alive.

Be prepared to throw the timings of the second half of this build out assuming any serious aggression, such as a Roach Bane all-in.

Transitions

This build transitions well into both Marine/Tank or Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine because it sets up the basic infrastructure needed for either of those and gets Stimpack.

The above transition involving double barracks after hellions followed by double ebay is the standard transition. In the event of an extreme all in, such as Roach bane, immediately begin marauder, mine, and bunker production. Against a strong Roach timing it is advised to begin tank production while slightly delaying either your Starport or Engineering Bays; this is most demonstrated notably in INnoVations series against Hyun in the WCS 2014 Global Finals.

Another great transition if you have done some damage with your Reapers or Hellions is going for a Hellbat/Marauder follow-up attack. How Dragon does this is throw down an Armory as soon as you start your 3rd Command Center, and then make Hellbats constantly as soon as the Armory finishes.  Starting two Engineering Bays and going for a +1/+1 Marauder/Hellbat push is a great way to keep up the aggression against your Zerg opponent. Keep in mind that this sort of 3CC Hellbat aggression is far weaker than a two base committed Hellbat push.

Pros and Cons

This build was originally intended as an aggressive opener backed by strong macro. In modern TvZ, however, any competent Zerg player will easily deflect Reaper Hellion pressure with minimal losses, and gasless three hatches are becoming increasingly rare due to the benefits provided by opening either Speedlings or Roach aggression. As such, the major pro of this build should now be listed as the amount of information that the Reaper can provide; because Zerg cannot proxy any tech, you should be aware of what Zerg is doing most of the time. In this way, opening Reaper/Hellion is inordinately safer than simply opening Hellions, if only because of the information difference.

The weakness of this build traditionally had been hyper aggressive openers, such as fast Speedling rushes (which can be deterred by bunkers between your 2nd CC and your main ramp), Roach/Bane busts (which can be held with bunkers, repair, and either mines or hellions with Marauders), or even fast Muta play (which INnoVation countered by simply pushing at his normal time with three missile turrets at home).

The new biggest threat against this build, however, is Roach timings. Simply put, this build focuses very heavily on Hellion production, and delays all other AOE quite significantly (usually up until around 11+ minutes). As such, 1-1 Roach Busts, or fast 2-2 Roach Hydra max out attacks, or even Roach Hydra into Brood Lords are all excellent examples of builds in which players should quickly identify, cut Hellions, and immediately begin adapting their builds for the situation.

Learning this Build and the Difficulty Curve

This build is undoubtedly one of the hardest macro builds to learn in the game. Besides its extreme adherence to timings and linear sequences, it is also extremely punishing in every aspect; INnoVation has refined this build to the point of impracticability; over queueing means delaying Hellions; delaying Hellions delays your Barracks, delaying your Barracks delays your starport, and delaying your starport delays your entire 1-1 push. In short, a single mistake has many more long lasting impacts as opposed to a standard Terran build.

To go about learning this build, it is important to work on only one section at a time and to not try to do everything at once when you first start off, else you will immediately fail.

In the order of things to focus on (#1 being top priority, and #8 being the lowest priority)

1. Worker Production
2. Not getting supply blocked, not over queueing, and proper rallies for all structures
3. The build itself (for example, starting Hellions before 5:30, or double E-bay and 2nd gas geyser at 7:40) and its relevant timings
4. Taking your Third base on time
5. Scouting
6. Keeping your Reaper Hellion alive
7. Harassing
8. Micro (Sniping the first creep tumor, catching the transfer of drones to the third base, weakening Queens to force transfuses and decrease tumors, sniping active tumors, runbys, etc.)

In short, always defer to the priorities, and only move down the line as you can accomplish the others. Even if you kill 32 Zerglings with your Hellions, it is irrelevant if you Medivacs finish at 12 minutes instead of 10:20. Even if you land your third base at 8:30, it is irrelevant if you only have 26 SCVs at the time instead of 40-50 that INnoVation might have. And even if you plant every structure down perfectly at the allotted times, supply blocks, over queueing, poor rallies, and suboptimal worker distribution also grind this entire build to a screeching halt.

Focus on one step at a time, and continually re watch INnoVations replays of this build from his view to fully internalize the mechanics and decisions that make this build brilliant.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,OrbitalCommand,Reaper,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,CommandCenter,GasScv,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Factory,SCV,SCV,CallMule,CommandCenter,SCV,LiftRaxFromReactor,OrbitalCommand,LandFactoryOnReactor,Marine,SCV,DoubleHellions,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,CallMule,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleHellions,StimPack,Marine,SCV,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,DoubleHellions,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnFactory,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,EngineeringBay,EngineeringBay,Refinery,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Marine,SCV,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,InfantryArmorLevel1,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,SCV,SCV,SCV,LandRaxOnReactor,LandRaxOnReactor,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Refinery,Refinery,ReactorOnFactory,Starport,SCV,SCV,SCV,CallMule,CallMule,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,ConcussiveShells,SCV,SCV,SCV,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,Armory,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,Marine,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Refinery', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:11 PM;

This all-in hits your opponent?s main with a lot of speed Roaches. However, Jaedong puts his own clever flair on this traditional ZvT All-in by using an Overlord Roach Drop to guarantee his Nydus follow-up is successful.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of very early force, position your Queens to defend your natural and consider getting a Spine Crawler. Banshee play may be an issue with only 2 Queens, but such a fast Lair means you will have a very quick Overseer.
The next scout will be with your initial Roach Warren attack. Terran will be forced to defend his main with all his units, so you?ll see either Bio or Mech units to defend. These Roaches should be able to scout and do some serious economic damage ? hopefully enough to end the game with constant reinforcements from the Nydus Network.

Transitions

This build is a 2 base all-in that gets a lot of attacking units and very few Drones as well as upgrades that do not lend themselves towards the mid or late game. Therefore, there is no well-defined follow-up for the build, should your attack fail. However, if you do a lot of damage with the attack but lose your Nydus Network, be sure to follow-up with a 3rd Hatchery, a lot more Drones, and 2 Evolution Chambers to try to transition into normal play.

Tips

- Against a Reaper/Hellion player, save your Queen energy after you start 2 or 3 Creep Tumors. Having energy for Transfuse lets you push back any early attacks without revealing your Roaches.
- Hide your Roaches for as long as possible before you move out. The less time you give your opponent to react to your build, the better your chance at crushing through their front.
- Make 2 Overlords per inject cycle ? 8 Roaches takes up 16 supply.
- Bring an Overseer or two with your Roach attack so that you have detection against Widow Mines. Remember to split your Roaches to avoid splash damage from either Widow Mines or Siege Tanks.
- This attack is an all-in, so you have to kill your opponent with this attack. Don?t let your Roaches mess around attacking buildings or SCVs ? kill your opponent?s army as soon as possible.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any player going for a fast 3 Command Center build (the current metagame) because of how late their upgrades and army will be. Also, any build that gets both Roach drops AND Nydus Networks is a very fun all-in to play with.
However, this is an all-in, so if you cannot do game-ending damage with the Roach attack, you will be economically behind the Terran opponent.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,MetabolicBoost,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Overlord,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Lair,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,RoachWarren,Drone,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,VentralSacs,Overlord,Overlord,GlialReconstitution,PneumatizedCarapace,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,NydusNetwork,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,NydusWorm', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:11 PM;

This build opens with fast upgrades and mass Speedlings to crush any midgame attacks. It then transitions into a strong 3 base Ultralisk timing to either cripple the Protoss opponent or outright win the game.

Scouting

Scout first with your 2 initial Zerglings, use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of the Protoss base depending on the map.   Check to see whether your opponent is Gateway expanding or Forge expanding. Be wary of early pressure if your opponent is Gateway expanding.
With your 7:00 overlord scout, consider adding a Baneling Nest if you are up against a Gateway timing. Make mass Speedlings to defend any 2 base ground plays or ramp up Queen production early to defend any 2 base air plays.
Against a 2 base Colossus push, consider adding a Spire for Corruptors if you need more defense. Also, regardless of whether or not you need to make Corruptors for defense, you should start Air upgrades in case of a Mutalisk switch after you have maxed out with your Ultralisk army.
Ideally, your Ultras should be out with +5/+3 around 15:50. Commit to an attack as soon as possible when these upgrades finish.  If you have yet to take a 4th base and Spire or Hydralisk Den by this stage in the game, get them now.

Transitions

There is no ?transition? per se.  If you can win the game with this push, then be sure to attack in an open position and take the game quickly. If you cannot win the game outright, then fall back on your 4 base economy and tech switch to whatever best counters your opponent?s army.

Tips

Against Pylon blocks

- If you want to try and guarantee the Hatchery being placed, send a Drone to your natural around 11/12 supply and hide it there. This might trick Protoss into thinking that you are going Pool first.  Note that this will not work every time, and it also will not stop a Protoss dedicated to Pylon blocking you.
- A 15 Pool/15 Hatch/15 Gas opener (or at worst ? if they fail to cancel the Pylon ? a 15 Pool/15 Gas/and Hatchery as soon as you can) will be fine in this case. The most important thing is starting your Extractor on time, not the natural Hatchery.
- Be sure to make 4-6 Zerglings to take the pylon down if you need to, and go up to 3 Queens as soon as you can ? just like normal.
- Once you place your Extractor, the first 100 gas goes to Metabolic Boost, and place your Evolution Chambers when you get to 175 gas like normal to transition back into the build.

The Engagement

- Bring your Queens to transfuse, and any optional Infestors or Banelings you made to force good engagements.
- Do NOT engage into a Protoss wall. You want to engage in as open an area as you possibly can for your melee army to do maximum damage.
- Do NOT engage without your queens in transfuse range unless you are sure you can take a strong fight. Strong creep spread with all of your Queens helps tremendously.
- Try to avoid Archons with your Zerglings; use the Ultralisks to tank those. Similarly, focus your Zerglings on Stalkers and Immortals; keep your Ultralisks away from those.
- If you use Ultralisks to crush any forcefields, Zerglings can actually deal with Colossi quite easily as they take minimal damage whilst underneath the Colossi.

Pros and Cons

This build is very strong against a ?standard? Protoss army of Gateway units, Colossi and some Stargate or Templar units. Also, this timing attack has the strong potential to end the game.
However, this build is somewhat simple for Protoss to scout and is vulnerable to timing attacks and all-ins when you only have upgraded Speedlings to defend. Also, if your Protoss opponent is positioned in a well defended location, the engage can be quite difficult to perform well.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Extractor,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Zergling,MetabolicBoost,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Queen,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,EvolutionChamber,EvolutionChamber,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,MeleeAttacksLevel1,GroundCarapaceLevel1,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,Lair,Overlord,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Overlord,Queen,InjectLarva,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,Extractor,Extractor,Queen,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Queen,Hatchery,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,MeleeAtacksLevel2,GroundCarapaceLevel2,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,Overlord,InfestationPit,SpawnCreepTumor,Queen,Queen,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Queen,Queen,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Hive,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Queen,Queen,Overlord,Overlord,Extractor,Extractor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Infestor,Infestor,Infestor,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,AdrenalineGlands,UltraliskCavern,MeleeAttacksLevel3,GroundCarapaceLevel3,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Hatchery,ChitinousPlating,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Ultralisk,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:11 PM;

This build opens with a fast expansion in order to get an economic advantage, using an Oracle for harass potential and defense until you can setup a Phoenix/Colossus midgame unit composition.

Benchmark: When your Robotics Facility finishes (@7:00ish), you should have 1 Oracle, 1 Stalker, 1 Sentry, a Mothership Core, and around 37 Probes.

Benchmark: When your 2nd Colossus finishes (@10:00ish), you should have 2 Colossi, 3 Phoenix, 1 Stalker, 3 Zealots, 2 Sentries, and a Mothership Core with over 50 Probes.

Scouting

Feel free to Probe scout after you build your Gateway in order to determine what your opponent is building. The majority of information about what Terran is doing however will come from what your opponent hits you with.  If you spot a Reaper coming into your base, then try and stop it from seeing your building Stargate with your Stalker and Mothership Core (do not worry too much if it is spotted however, for your Stargate is only initially being used for one Oracle). If you do not spot a Reaper, then send your Mothership Core and use its huge sight range to spot what buildings your opponent has inside of his base before returning home.

The majority of your midgame scouting will come from your Oracle. Use it to spot whether your opponent is opening with Bio, going for fast upgrades, fast triple Command Center, or strong 2 base timing. If you see an opening, then the Oracle can be used to harass your opponent?s SCVs, but the true purpose of the Oracle is constant scouting through the midgame. Your opponent?s 3rd base timing is especially useful as a good benchmark for when you should try and take your 3rd base.

Transitions

The build transitions into a Phoenix/Colossus midgame, with a standard Colossus/High Templar/Archon late game. As soon as you spot your opponent taking his 3rd base, secure a third of your own, then start 2 Forges and several more Gateways. Keep producing Phoenix and Colossus until you have around 7 of each (7 is a LOT for a normal game, but the heavily delayed High Templar tech means that you have a stronger army in the midgame), supplementing your army with Zealots when you have extra minerals. Finally, when your +1/+1 is halfway done, be sure to start a Twilight Council for +2/+2, Zealot Charge, and Templar Archives in order to reach your lategame army.

Tips

- In the early game, you are attempting to get your economy up enough to support Phoenix/Colossus on 2 bases.  Be sure to chronoboost your Probes constantly until you need to divert chronoboost to your Robotics Facility/Stargate.
- Against Reaper play, position your initial Stalker and Mothership Core defensively.  Try to deny it scouting your Stargate, but don?t worry if it is scouted?the Stargate is only initially used for one Oracle.
- The main purpose of your initial Oracle is for scouting. While it is true that you can kill several SCVs if your opponent?s Marines are out of position, do NOT sacrifice your Oracle for a few extra kills. The constant threat of harass and ability to scout for the first 10 minutes of the game is a lot more important than an extra SCV kill or two.
- Position your Phoenix defensively outside your main (to absolutely shut down any midgame drops) up until you are ready to take your third.  If/when your Oracle dies, use your flock of Phoenix to take map control and kill several SCVs with any extra APM you have.
- Take your third base and start 2 Forges as soon as you spot your opponent taking his 3rd base.
- Build more Colossus (up to 7) than you normally would (around 4). With the extra air support tanking and killing Vikings, your Colossus count must be quite large in order to take out your opponent?s Bio army.

Pros and Cons

This build gets out an early Oracle for harass potential and constant scouting. It also gets a strong economy and uses a midgame Phoenix/Colossus unit composition to defend drops and bio pushes with ease. This midgame composition is quite robust in terms of defending your third as well as stopping constant Medivac harass.

However, this build is short on Gateway units for the early stages of the game. Thus, any early drops are quite hard to stop unless you are able to scout them beforehand and prepare appropriately. Also, you do not start your Forges until you start your third base, so you will often be behind in upgrades against a macro-Terran.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,MothershipCore,Nexus,GasProbe,GasProbe,WarpgateUpgrade,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,Probe,Stargate,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Probe,Oracle,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Observer,RoboticsBay,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Observer,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,ExtendedThermalLance,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Phoenix,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Phoenix,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Phoenix,Chronoboost', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:11 PM;

This 3 Hatchery opening transitions into a strong Speedling/Hydralisk timing to hit the third base of Protoss before its economy can kick in. It then tech switches instantly into Spire or Roach/Hydra/Viper play to best counter the unit composition Protoss has used to defend the pressure.

Scouting

Once you are into the midgame, all of your scouting will come from what your opponent hits you with, and then later your Ling/Hydra timing attack. Assuming your opponent has opened with Stargate play, you will either see Phoenix harassing your Overlords/Drones or a Void Ray for defense while your opponent tries to take a third. As soon as you have confirmed your opponent going for Stargate play (either with an early Overlord scout or by any of the above cues), you can choose to go through with this build.
When you are attacking your opponent?s third base with your Ling/Hydra timing, be sure to note your opponent?s unit composition. Against Colossus play, throw down a Spire. Against Stargate play, keep making Hydralisks. Against Blink play or a strong ground army, transition into Roach/Hydra/Viper play or continue with a Ling/Hydra unit composition and +2/+2 upgrades.

Transitions

This build is designed to tech switch as soon as you spot the unit composition of your opponent, so it has quite a few transitions. In all cases, as you are moving out with the Ling/Hydra timing attack, be sure to start your 4th Hatchery.
If your Ling/Hydra timing runs into a Colossus, start a Spire and take 2 more Extractors at your 4th Hatchery. Go for a hard Mutalisk switch to catch your opponent off-guard and keep applying pressure/harassing your opponent?s Probes, while you take the map and transition into the late game. Killing off any Phoenix during your Ling/Hydra timing will strengthen this transition dramatically. Going for a Hive instantly and getting Vipers can be strong against Colossus play too.
If your Ling/Hydra timing runs into a Chargelot/Void Ray or pure Skytoss unit composition, then be sure to keep making Drones and out-expand your opponent OR keep committing to the fight by rallying more and more Hydralisks and Speedlings in an attempt to break your opponent. If you choose to macro and out-expand your opponent, a Roach/Hydra/Viper unit composition with 2 Evolution Chambers is quite standard ? so start +2/+2 Missile upgrades and Hive tech as soon as you can.

Tips

- If your first Overlord scouts your opponent going for a Gateway expand, then you should abandon getting the third base, instead getting an Extractor and starting Metabolic Boost before taking your 3rd.
- Also, if you feel unsafe opening with a Hatchery First against a Forge First Fast Expand, then feel free to open with a Pool First into 3 Hatchery Opener and transition into this build in exactly the same manner.
- If your natural gets Pylon blocked, then you can make an early Overlord at 15 supply instead of the Hatchery in order to buy some time against it. If your opponent lets the Pylon finish, then simply making 4-6 Zerglings to take the Pylon down should be enough of a commitment before returning back to the build.
- Being thorough about checking for early proxy Pylons across the map with your early game Zerglings is crucial against early Protoss timings. Being able to spot aggression and stop it before it can even begin is the easiest way to avoid quick losses.
- There is no need for a Roach Warren if you spot your opponent going for a Forge Fast Expand into Phoenix build, as Jaedong scouts when beating Dear at the WCS Finals.
- During the Ling/Hydra timing, be sure not to fight in a choke where force fields will split your Zerglings from Hydralisks.
- During the Ling/Hydra timing, spread your army to help reduce Colossus splash damage. Target firing any Colossus or getting on top of the Robotics Facility is a great way to perform game-ending damage.
- Start your 4th Hatchery before the fight so that your transition is backed with maximal economy.  Perform the tech switch reacting to your opponent?s unit composition as soon as you can.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a hugely economic opening in order to fund a 3 Base Ling/Hydra timing to crush your opponent?s 3rd Nexus. It also does not commit much to the attack, allowing you to tech switch instantly and counter the unit composition your opponent has chosen to defend their third with.
However, this build is weak to early pressure, for you skip the Roach Warren for safety against early 2 base Protoss attacks. Also, because this build opens with a gasless 3 Hatchery opener, you should only be performing this build against Forge Fast Expanding players.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Queen,Zergling,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Queen,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,MetabolicBoost,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Drone,EvolutionChamber,EvolutionChamber,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,MeleeAttacksLevel1,MissleAttacksLevel1,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Lair,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,SporeCrawler,SporeCrawler,SporeCrawler,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,HydraliskDen,HydraliskDen,Overseer,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GroovedSpines,MuscularAugments,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,InjectLarva,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hydralisk,Hatchery,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:11 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Life Baneling Bust', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with a quick 3 Hatcheries, faking as if you are going for a macro-oriented play, but then builds an overwhelmingly large swell of Zerglings and Baneling busts your opponent before they are ready.

Scouting

Use your initial 2 Zerglings to probe the front of your opponent?s natural. Assuming they don?t die, send them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or outside the front of the Terran?s base depending on the map.
Your next scout will be with your Baneling bust. Based off of how strong your opponent?s wall is, what unit composition he is using to defend, and how many SCVs you kill, react accordingly.

Transitions

While technically this build gets a third base, you are on a very low Drone count, and are spending all of your money on an early all-in that absolutely has to deal some amount of economic damage. Usually the only viable follow-up is sending wave after wave of Zerglings and Banelings in order to finish off your opponent, but if Terran has pushed you back or  over-committed to a strong wall-off, just pull back and Drone at home. Transition into standard Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk play if possible.

Tips

- While Life opens with a 15 Spawning Pool, you can perform this same build by opening with a 15 Hatchery as well.
- Hide your 2nd Extractor and Banelings Nest from areas where your opponent is likely to scout with a Reaper or Hellion.
- Morph your Banelings out of sight of your opponent?s wall-off, so your opponent does not know that you are about to hit him until your Baneling bust is already happening.
- Be sure to send your Banelings in to target down any Bunkers or Supply Depots in the wall first and then flood in with the rest of your Zerglings.
- Most of your initial army will likely die. The true win happens from your rallied army and any more Banelings you morph from it.

Pros and Cons

This build hits an early 2 Base timing when your opponent is less likely to be expecting any pressure, let alone a strong all-in. Without a strong wall-off or excellent micro, it will walk over most unsuspecting Terran players.
However, this build sacrifices a lot of economy and tech in order to fund such a huge army.

This is still the super standard and passive blink stylethat gets only 2 gates instead of 3 early and a slightly earlier robo.Only chronos blink ONCE so that you can focus the rest of probes to get eco going for the 2 base play as early as possible.

This blink is by no means meant to be used aggressively. It is simply adefensive blink opener that can react to many different things and just be an overall safe opener. (You might want to go up to 3 gates if you scout them going factory after 1 rax FE in case they go for a marine/hellion drop so that you can be sure you have enough stalkers out) 

From there you get a robo bay for early colossus andspend all chronoboosts into that roboto get them out as quickly as possible. You also fit in some cannons to help defend vs drops. Even if he doesn't open widow mines, you can still afford them in the build so I don't see any downside to getting them no matter what for the extra defense. 

After that you simplyget 4 more gates to go up to a total of 7and then make only stalkers and colossus and brute force your way in with +1 attack behind you.

Why this late of an attack works

So basically this buildpretends to be a really safe and passive opener. It looks like a passive blink/colossus opener that just defends and takes a slow third to stay extra safe. By the time a terran would be scouting and realizing that you aren't actually taking a third, the attack is going to be knocking at his door. It's simply a very oddly timed attack, but it hits at such a crucial point. This is basically when the terran's third should be getting saturated and his first wave of attempted aggression will have been deflected.You're hitting him in his transitional period between his 2 base set up and his 3 base set up: getting a few more barracks with add ons and his attempted switch into vikings. This is when the terran wants to sit for just a minute before being able to go for more rounds of aggression. If you trade very well earlier on when he tries to do some drops, then that just makes this timing even wider because he will have to keep making medivacs instead of vikings and will just in general have less units.

The reason why there's no zealots or sentries is because the build is focusing so much on anti drop defense early on. It's also an extremely brute force all in. It's meant to really jump into the terrans face and have high chasing power vs retreating medivacs and also to be able todrop vikings instantly. If you can keep the vikings from killing the colossus then they will do an absurd amount of damage with that early of a +1 attack. Thelarge quantity of blink stalkersalso makes it so thatevery unit you have is microable and savable. This isn't like most colossus all ins where it's just straight to colossus as early as possible.

This PvT opener opens with early Oracles to smash through un-upgraded marines and harass your opponent?s mineral line, all while taking an expansion back at home and transitioning into the midgame.

Scouting

This build opens aggressively with lots of units, so there is no need to be worried about early pressure. However, in order for you to control your Oracles well and attack in the correct places, it is necessary to know what your opponent is building. Thus, use your early game map control with your Stalkers and Mothership Core to poke in and see whether your opponent is going for Widow Mines/where they are building Turrets/how they have positioned their Marines so that you will know when and how to attack with your oracles.

Transitions

This build transitions into any normal midgame that you would like. At around the 8 minute mark, plant down either a Robotics Facility or Twilight Council to start your teching into Colossus or High Templars+Storm. Then, after your Oracle harass has finished, you will already be halfway to your desired tech. Getting more gateways down and the upgrades (+1 Ground Armor and Charge/Storm) started while you are harassing your opponent is very important.

Alternatively, you can go for a Phoenix/Colossus midgame army. Plant down a Robotics Facility at around the 8 minute mark and tech straight for Colossi on 4 Assimilators. When your Robotics Bay finishes, start 2 more Gateways, start your first Colossus, and begin producing Phoenix in order to re-converge to a play style akin to Jim?s Phoenix/Colossus Build.

Tips

- Use your first Stalker to deny an SCV/Reaper scout and keep your opponent in the dark as to what build you are going.
- Rally your Oracles to an airspace near your opponent?s base so that your push happens as soon as you are ready.
- The Mothership Core can poke in and around your opponent?s main base to see what tech buildings they have and/or what units they are building.
- Go in with your first Oracle if they opened with gas to start applying pressure soon. If you wait for 3 or 4 Oracles, a Widow Mine drop might be already on the way and you would not be able to defend it.
- Wait for more Oracles if they opened gasless 1rax FE and your stalkers have not been able to do any damage. If you go in too soon, then they?ll just build a reactive missile turret and shut down your later Oracles.
- Remember: Oracles scale REALLY well. 3 Oracles can take down up to 10 marines without losing a single Oracle.  Be aggressive vs marines, and super defensive vs turrets/widow mines.
- Do not forget to include the Mothership Core in the fight ? its DPS and Time Warp spell are very useful when taking out marines/units.
- Start that midgame transition BEFORE you focus on the harass in your opponent?s base so that after the Oracle harass has finished, you will already be halfway to your desired midgame tech.

Pros and Cons

This build gives you map control and hits your opponents with a lot of early game Oracles to destroy a mineral line. It is strong because Oracles absolutely destroy un-upgraded marines, and are maneuverable enough that they can track down and run after SCVs.

However, opening with this build delays your expand a lot more than if you had opened straight 1gate FE. Because you have less economy, the midgame Terran timing attacks with medivacs are even scarier than normal (unless you do damage with your Oracles), so you actually have to do damage to attempt to transition into the midgame. Remember that Oracles have very little health, so you have to babysit your units if you have any hope of not losing them instantly to a well placed Missile Turret/Widow Mine.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,MothershipCore,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Stargate,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Sentry,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Oracle,Probe,Nexus,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Chronoboost,Oracle,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Oracle,Probe,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:12 PM;

This build opens up with a quick 3 base economy to stay safe against any early Terran shenanigans as well as give you enough power to hit a strong Zergling/Baneling timing before your Terran opponent can get their 3 base economy rolling. One main strength of this build is that the timing push is not all-in, but rather a tool to get you safely to the familiar position of Mutalisks and 4 bases without having to deal with unrelenting Terran pressure.

Scouting

Note the 7:00 Overlord scout to check whether your opponent is going for Bio or Mech. Do not continue with this build order if your Overlord scout spots your opponent going for Mech.
If you scout a Reaper/Hellion/Banshee opener, keeping your Queens alive without Metabolic Boost is quite difficult. Instead of blindly rushing into this build, get a few Spine Crawlers and 1 Spore Crawler per mineral line with an extra Spore or two between the natural and 3rd Hatchery.  It is fine to commit a lot to defense in this situation as going Reaper/Hellion/Banshee slows down any Bio/Mine pushes considerably.
By the time you attack just after 11 minutes, you must know how Terran is going to defend. Run a Zergling or two at Terran?s wall where you want to bust through to spot what army composition is waiting.
- If you scout Bio/Mine, continue as normal with the initial bust.
- If you scout Marine/Tank, consider continuing the bust. However, if you see more than one Siege Tank, be sure to retreat and build your Spire/Creep/Hive!
- If you scout Mech this late, you have most likely already lost. Transitioning into Mutalisks or Swarm Hosts instantly may be enough to keep you alive, but know that you have committed a lot of resources to a bust that cannot succeed.

Transitions

Once you perform the bust, you will either outright win the game, do a little bit of economic damage and trade armies, or completely fail without doing any serious damage. In either of the first two cases, continue to deny the most recent Terran base (either an undefended 3rd, or a future 4th if their 3rd is well established), and continue to play the macro game. If your bust has completely failed, then you can attempt to play the macro game with your 5 Hatcheries already done, but note that you have committed and subsequently a lost of resources going into the macro game.
In a macro game, go up to Hive tech when you most prefer. Some Zergs delay it, some get it faster. Life is known for getting it for +3/+3 and faster Ultralisks. Eventually transitioning into Ultralisk/Queen/Infestor is a solid end-game unit composition ? just be sure that you have enough static defense to deny doom drops and stop Terran from spreading you too thin as you attempt to create this scary army.

Tips

- Against any early pressure, your Queens and a Spine Crawler are all the defense you will need.  With a later Metabolic Boost, you cannot rely on Speedlings to help defend any 1 base all-ins.
- Do your best to clear the map of any of your opponent?s Hellions BEFORE you are ready to bust. Being able to spawn your Banelings close to your opponent as opposed to back at your base makes this bust a lot more effective.
- Get an Overseer before the initial bust to help clear any Widow Mines. However, this build hits early enough that there should not be too many Widow Mines up just yet for you to worry about.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any player going for a Tank-less 3 Command Center build (the current metagame). Also, because you saturate your third base before moving out, it is quite easy to stop Zergling/Baneling production and transition into a macro game with a strong economic advantage.
However, this build sacrifices quick Mutalisks in lieu of more Zerglings and Banelings, so early drops can be a problem. Also, with such a heavy melee army, you have to be wary of Widow Mine detonations destroying your entire army.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Queen,InjectLarva,Queen,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Overlord,SpawnCreepTumor,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,MetabolicBoost,EvolutionChamber,EvolutionChamber,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Queen,SpawnCreepTumor,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,MeleeAttacksLevel1,GroundCarapaceLevel1,Overlord,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Lair,Hatchery,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,BanelingNest,Extractor,Extractor,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Overlord,SpawnCreepTumor,Hatchery,SpawnCreepTumor,CentrifugalHooks,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,MeleeAtacksLevel2,GroundCarapaceLevel2,InjectLarva,Overlord,Overlord,SpawnCreepTumor,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,SpawnCreepTumor,Overseer,Overseer,Overseer', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:12 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'MacSed 5gate', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build is a fast expand build that opens with a Mothership Core for defense, and then follows-up with a very quick 5gate timing with Zealots and Sentries to crush your opponent before they can even enter their midgame tech.

Scouting

After the early game, scouting is much more minimal than you might expect. As long as you can confirm your opponent is getting a third Hatchery (and sometimes even if they are not getting one), you should be able to go through with this build.

With your attack, you will be able to scout what units he is using to defend. If you are fighting mass Speedling, then constantly warp-in Zealots and Sentries.  If you are fighting Roaches, then constantly warp-in Stalkers. Your opponent should not be able to get out either Hydras or Mutalisks in time to defend this attack.

Transitions

If it appears that your opponent has way over-committed to defending your attack with units or Spine Crawlers, you can always retreat and go for the macro game. Either force field your opponent back and walk home or mass recall your army to your natural Nexus. A common follow-up to this build is starting a Robotics Facility and going for Colossi to deal with your opponent s Roaches. Alternatively, you can go for a Stargate and make Phoenix in order to prepare for your opponent s Mutalisks. Be sure to use Hallucinations often to check-up on what midgame tech your opponent is going for. Take a third base when you feel safe.

Pros and Cons

This build opens with a Gateway expand, so your 5gate attack will hit very soon (before 7 minutes). This build usually hits your opponent before they have any midgame tech.

However, this build relies on you deflecting your opponent s scouting information in order for it to be maximally effective. If your opponent sees your Gateway count before you move out, then it is unlikely you will be able to out-produce a mass Roach defense.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Nexus,MothershipCore,WarpgateUpgrade,Chronoboost,Probe,Sentry,GasProbe,GasProbe,Pylon,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Sentry,Zealot,Sentry,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,WarpInSentry,WarpInSentry,WarpInZealot,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:12 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'MKP 1-1-1 All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This is a highly aggressive, 1 base 1/1/1 all-in which focuses on early harass to damage your opponent while simultaneously building up army for a follow-up all-in. While this build has the potential to fall back into a macro game, transitioning into the midgame is difficult if early damage is not inflicted on the opponent.

Scouting

This build gives you several opportunities for scouting. Your first bit of information comes from getting your scouting SCV into his base between 12 and 16 food. If you manage to get your SCV into your opponents base, check for how many Refineries your opponent has. If your opponent does not have gas, they will most likely be doing a 1rax FE build. This presents one of the better scenarios for your early game Hellion drop to workespecially if your opponent does not anticipate the Hellion drop. If your opponent has one Refinery, it likely means that your opponent will be going for Reapers, have a Marine/Hellion defense, or have a Marine/Widow Mine defense. With your Hellions drop, do not over commit, simply keep your opponent busy. If your opponent attempts to Hellion expand, he will pull ahead economically assuming his defense prevents your hellions from inflicting any damage. You will most likely not see a second gas geyser with your SCV scout.

Once you have your first Hellions out, you should have full map control by clearing any XelNaga Towers and poking the front. Running in to spot your opponents natural is also a smart move, but be sure to pull back if there are any units defending. Your Hellions are there to increase the effectiveness of your later all-in, not to end the game early on.

Lastly, when you Hellion drop in his main, you should finally be able to see everything your opponent has gone for. If your opponent has gone for Cloaked Banshees, it will not instantly be a threat because he will need to keep the Banshee in his base to defend his workers. Later, once you have a Raven, Banshees will no longer be an issue. If your opponent has gone for Hellions of his own, be careful when out on the map, and always favor retreating if your Hellions are in danger. If your opponent has gone for Widow Mines, be sure to avoid obvious spots where he could have placed them.

Ideal Game

Your Hellion drop should inflict some kind of damage to your opponent and keep him occupied with defensive measures. However, even while doing damage with them, it is important to keep them alive. With ideal Hellion harass, your later all-in will overwhelm your opponent or trade in your favor.

If your opponent is prepared for the all-in engagement, he will most likely have either a Bunker, Siege Tanks, or both to defend. Your Hellions from earlier can help clear SCVs repairing the Bunker. Assuming you need to siege and push slowly because he has Tanks, consider dropping your Hellions again to divert some forces and his attention. However, remember that every unit is precious, so do not over commit with this drop.

Transitioning

In the situation where you cannot straight up win the game with your all-in but still have him contained, consider expanding and transitioning into Marine/Tank play or Mech. Simply throw down an expansion, take more gas, and ramp up your production from there.

If the all-in fails and your opponent is ahead economically, then you will have most likely lost the game. However, expanding and defending this base with Siege Tanks can still be a last-ditch option.

Tips

- With your first two Hellions, clear the XelNaga Watchtowers and take map control.
- During your Hellion drop, be sure to constantly pump Marines from your Reactored Barracks and produce Siege Tanks.  The strength of this build is the follow-up all-in, not the initial Hellion drop.
- Do NOT lose your Hellions when dropping them.  Use the Medivac boost to get your Hellions out of there if they are ever in danger.
- When moving out, be sure to bring 2 SCVs to repair.
- Slowly siege your opponent unless you are sure you can crush through the front.
- Remember to use Seeker Missile or Auto Turrets from your Raven to push the fight in your favor.

Pros and Cons

This build is a 1-2 punch of sortsfirst hitting with a Hellion drop and then following up with a Marine/Tank all-in. It is often too much for expanding opponents to handle and quickly ends the game. The Hellion drop can also be deadly harass if your opponent does not scout it or defend appropriately.

However, because this build was created by MarineKing himself, it is quite micro intensive, and thus is hard to pull off as a lower league player. Also, as an all-in, theres no clear way to transition out of it if it appears you cannot bust up the ramp.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Factory,CallMule,SCV,Refinery,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Starport,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,SCV,DoubleHellions,Medivac,SupplyDepot,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,LiftFactoryFromReactor,SCV,LiftRaxFromTechLab,LandRaxOnReactor,LandFactoryOnTechLab,DoubleMarines,SiegeTank,SupplyDepot,TechLabOnStarport,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,Raven,DoubleMarines,SCV,DoubleMarines,SiegeTank,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Medivac', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:12 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Maru Reaper FE to Hellbat-Banshee Push', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Reaper FE transitions into a fast 2 base Hellbat Banshee timing in order to crush your opponent early regardless of whether or not they open with Roaches.

Scouting

Use your Reaper to poke around your opponents natural and ascertain whether or not they are performing an early all-in. Later, when you have Hellions out, poke the front to ensure that your opponent is taking a 3rd base and not performing some delayed 2 base all-in. Favor keeping your Hellions alive over getting more scouting information/killing Drones because you will need every Hellion later for the Hellbat Banshee timing.

During your actual attack, be sure to note whether your opponent is defending with Roaches (which means a potential Roach/Hydra midgame, or at the very least delayed Mutalisks) or with Ling/Bane (which means a probable Ling/Bane/Muta midgame, and a more standard Mutalisk timing).

Transitions

This build opens with a 1/1/1 and therefore does not yet commit to a Bio or Mech midgame. It can in fact transition into either quite easily.

For a Bio (+Hellbat or Widow Mine) transition, start your 3rd Command Center as you swap off your Barracks onto the Starports Tech lab in order to start Stimpack research, 2 Engineering Bays, and 4 more Barracks. Use non-Stimpack Medivac drops to delay your opponent while you get up the necessary midgame infrastructure.

For a Mech transition, start your 3rd Command Center, 2 Factories, and 2 more Refineries. Continue Banshee production to deal with a Roach counter-attack as well as take advantage of the delayed Mutalisk tech.

Tips

- Use your initial Marine to try and pick off an early scouting Overlord as well as deny early Drone scouts.
- Your Reaper is not meant to deal damage, but rather give you some basic scouting and map control.
- Do NOT over-commit your Hellions while scouting around your opponents base; you will need all of them for the followup Hellbat Banshee timing to be effective.
- Try and position a Marine or two inside your base to shoot down any scouting Overlords.
- During the actual Hellbat Banshee attack, be sure to stutter step into Roaches and Queens, and spread/kite Zerglings and Banelings.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong 2 base all-in that can outright kill an unsuspecting Zerg opponent, and at the very least forces a huge response in order to defend. By forcing your opponent to make an army, you keep both of your economies low and extend the midgame (where Terran is arguably best in TvZ). Also, this build is better than an exclusively Hellbat attack because of Banshees effectiveness against Roaches.

However this attack requires a lot of micro in order to keep up with a rally of Hellions and Banshees.

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker back to the protection of your Sentries/Force fields and warp-in units quickly if you have to defend an early attack.

The majority of your scouting comes from your Hallucinated Phoenix. Your phoenix should be able to get into your opponent?s main base and determine what tech route you see your opponent going.

- If your opponent is expanding quickly, then feel safe. Consider going for a midgame Immortal+Gateway bust.
- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then be sure that you do not fall behind in the Immortal/Colossus count going into the midgame. Do NOT over produce Stalkers.
- If your opponent has a Stargate, then be sure to not take damage against early Phoenix or Oracles. Produce several Stalkers to initially protect your mineral lines, but consider getting a Stargate of your own or going for a quick Blink timing in order to truly stay safe against your opponent. Keep a tabs on when they take their natural expansion ? a 3gate Stargate attack can be deadly if you are skipping too many warp-ins or teching too aggressively.
- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then make one Observer for detection against DTs and constantly produce Immortals. Also be sure to position your army/Mothership Core defensively in order to safely defend any Blink attacks.

Transitions

This build is a very strong macro opener that transitions into a macro game quite easily. However, the actual unit composition of that macro game very often depends completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with. If your opponent stays on one base for too long, then throw down more Gateways, constantly make units, and prepare to defend your natural with Stalkers, Immortals, and your Planetary Nexus. In Robotics vs Stargate macro games, quickly switch into Blink or Stargate play of your own so as to not lose against any Void Ray based armies. In Robotics vs Robotics macro games, Immortal count and/or Colossus count are the most important things.  Keep tabs on your opponent?s tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Robotics vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponent?s potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by producing Immortals+Gateway units or Colossus for defense.

Tips

- Use all your initial chronoboost on Probes so as to establish your economic advantage going into the midgame.
- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial Stalker to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap?s 3gate All-in).
- Against all 1 base attacks, you must defend using your Planetary Nexus. To maximize your protection, save your Mothership Core energy as long as possible ? only calling in your Planetary Nexus once your opponent has committed to attacks. Be sure to constantly chronoboost Immortals out for maximum DPS against ground-based armies.
- Against Blink play, be sure to position some of your army and an Immortal or two in your main base to destroy any Stalkers that blink up outside the range of your Planetary Nexus.
- Against Stargate play, be sure to warp-in some initial Stalkers and position your units to defend both mineral lines from potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very versatile, macro build that takes advantage of the power and range of your Planetary Nexus in order to stay safe against early attacks. It also gets detection and Immortals for defense, so very often you have a more stable opening than most other PvP builds.

However, defending early Stargate play can be quite tricky as your Robotics Facility does not help at all in producing anti-air units. Also, this build requires a lot of scouting information to be executed effectively, so getting a Hallucination into your opponent?s base is crucial.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,CyberneticsCore,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,WarpgateUpgrade,Stalker,Probe,MothershipCore,Sentry,Nexus,Gateway,Sentry,Pylon,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Immortal,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:12 PM;

This CC First build takes your economy immediately into the midgame and then transitions into a 9 minute, 2 base Marine/Hellion/Medivac timing with Stimpack.

Scouting

Build the Command Center on the high ground and then wall-off with your initial Barracks. This way, you will not have to worry about early Zerglings because you will have a full wall. Thus, SCV scouting is no longer necessary.

Your first scouting comes from the first Hellions you make. With these Reactor Hellions, you can take map control, clears out any Zerglings at watchtowers, and pokes Zergs front to spot the Zergs third base, any buildings at the front, and any units that Zerg is making.

If you see a ton of Speedlings, then make sure your Hellion micro is on point. Feel free to pull back behind your natural wall in order to more effectively deal with Speedlings.

If you see Roaches, then immediately cut Reactor Hellion production and start making Widow Mines two at a time. Delay your Starport for a little while in order to afford Marauders, and consider cutting SCVs in order to complete a wall-off at your natural and prevent your opponent from running past your Bunker/Widow Mines.

If you see two Evolution Chambers, then assume your opponent is playing a macro game.

Alternatively, if you see a third base, then you can also assume your opponent is playing a macro game.

Transitions

This build transitions pretty normally into standard Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine play as well as Marine/Tank/Medivac play in a pretty common manner. However, because of the resources and time you have devoted to Bio units and upgrades, this build cannot transition into Mech.

For either the Bio/Mine or Marine/Tank transition, as you are pushing out, instantly start your 3rd Command Center, Combat Shields, and 2 Engineering Bays. It is also strongly suggested that you continue Medivac and Marine production before adding on more Barracks so that you can continue unrelenting drop play and keep your opponent on their half of the map while you are attempting to take your own third and get into your comfortable late-game infrastructure. When your Engineering Bays finish, be sure to start your Infantry upgrades, all of your Refineries, and throw down up to 5 more Barracks to be able to pump out your 3 base army.

If you are going for Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine play, be sure to start a Reactor on your naked Factory and start Widow Mine production (adding a 2nd Factory with a Tech lab for the Widow Mine upgrade once you have later secured your third).

If you are going for a Marine/Tank/Medivac play, be sure to start a Tech lab on your naked Factory and start Siege Tank production (adding a 2nd Factory with a Tech lab once you have later secured your third).

Tips

- Do NOT over commit with your initial Hellions. Use them exclusively for scouting purposes in the early game; their true purpose is to bolster your ground army in the actual Marine/Hellion/Medivac timing attack.
- Against any all-ins with this build, you must rely on your Bunker placement, SCV control, and scouting it coming. Be active on the map with your first Hellions so that you know what is coming your way before it gets to your doorstep.
- Feel free to push out with your Bio army even before Stimpack/Medivacs are even done. As long as you have Hellions scouting in front to ensure you are not being all-inned, your Bio army can be walking across the map while your Medivacs boost in behind them so that you hit your opponent the second Stimpack finishes.
- Do NOT clump up against Banelings. Your opponent should not be able to have that many Banelings by the 9 minute attack, but be sure to spread your army and micro appropriately if you see Banelings on the field.
- Remember to pick up your Marines into the Medivacs and boost away as soon as your army is finally overtaken. Keeping your opponent on their side of the map while you set up your own third base is crucial.
- Save at least one scan to kill creep. As a Zerg, losing your initial midgame creep and a Queen or two spreading it can be devastating for the later stages of the game.

Pros and Cons

This build opens quite economically, and then transitions into making a strong army and hitting your opponent with a lot of units at the 9 minute mark before they can even stabilize their third base economy. It is a very strong build for punishing greedy Zergs.

However, while it is a CC First opener that is not at all all-in, it is definitely not nearly as macro-oriented as the standard Reactor Hellion 3CC build or other 3CC builds such as Polts Map Control Build. Also, if your opponent can see it coming and overproduces units to defend, you will have to pick up and rely on drop play instead of a large frontal assault to get an advantage.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Bunker,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SCV,CallMule,Factory,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,SCV,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Refinery,TechLabOnBarracks,CallMule,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,StimPack,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marauder,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,DoubleHellions,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Starport,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleHellions,SCV,Marauder,SCV,CallMule,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,Marauder,DoubleMedivacs,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,ReactorOnFactory,Marauder,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:12 PM;

If he goes for ahydra ling bust, then you need to continuously chrono phoenix. You don't try to get colossus up ASAP, that will just end in tears.

This build opens with a 1gate FE and then transitions into a strong timing attack with +2/+2 Chargelots and Archons.

Benchmark: When you start Charge (@8:10ish), you should have 1 Mothership Core, 1 Stalker, 3 Sentries, and 45 Probes.

Push out when your 3rd Archon finishes (@11:00ish) with 3 Sentries, 3 Archons, 1 Stalker, and around 12 Zealots, with +2/+2 about to finish.

Scouting

In the early game, Probe scout after your Gateway in order to spot whether your opponent is opening with a Reaper or Widow Mine drop. Against Reaper play you have to position your initial few units very defensively in order to avoid losing any Probes. Against a Widow Mine drop, be sure to build those Photon Cannons in your mineral lines as soon as your Forges finish. After the early game, scouting is much more minimal than you might expect. As long as you can confirm your opponent is not 1 base all-inning you (Hallucinations can give you a lot of information), you can perform this build.

Transitions

This build is a strong two base timing attack, so be sure to commit all your energy into non-stop warping in from a proxy Pylon in order to bust through your opponent?s front. In most situations, you will simply be able to walk through your opponent?s front and win the game.

However, if your opponent has a strong defense at his natural (Supply Depots and multiple Bunkers), you do already have plenty of Probes back at home, so you can simply start a 3rd Nexus, resume Probe Production, continue upgrades by getting +3/+3, and transition into Storm play. If you are going for this macro play, then be sure to get out several Colossus before you max out for a stronger 200 supply army.

Tips

- You are only able to afford so many units because of how many Probes you have. Be sure to Chronoboost your Nexii as often as possible in the early game to get up a strong 2 base economy.
- The limiting factor in this build is the Forge upgrades.  After the early game, Chronoboost your Forges as often as you can so that your 11 minute attack hits with +2/+2.
- Hallucinate Phoenix to get scouting information on your opponent?s opening build order.
- Against Reaper play, position your initial units defensively.
- Against Widow Mine play, be sure to get out those Photon Cannons in each mineral line on time. Using your Photon Overcharge and target firing an early Medivac can be a game changer in defending early pressure.
- Set up multiple proxy Pylons before you are ready to move out so that even if your opponent kills one or two of them, you will be able to reinforce your attack.
- During the attack, be sure that your army does not waste time attacking buildings.  Focus fire and reposition your army so that everything is always fighting your opponent?s army.
- If your opponent has a solid wall at his natural, then do not commit to a doomed attack. Simply playing the macro game with your upgrade advantage is a much stronger option.

Pros and Cons

This is a strong attack that destroys Bio players who do not have good building placement or who are playing too greedy. Also, your strong attack has +2/+2 and 60 Probes ? so even if it fails, you have a strong economy and upgrade lead going into the late game.

This build is not great against early Widow Mine drops because your only detection is the Photon Cannons in your mineral lines.

This build opens with a Nexus First and only enough units to secure a ridiculously fast 3rd base. With a 3 base economy, it then hits a 9 minute 7 gate attack comprised of mainly Stalkers and Sentries.

Scouting

This build opens incredibly greedily, so be sure that your opponent is expanding and droning with an initial Probe scout. Besides any initial Probe(s), however, this build does not give you any tools with which to scout your opponent. The majority of your scouting will come with the actual attack at 9 minutes.

Transitions

This build can either all-in or transition comfortably into a macro game.

If you are choosing to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly warp-in and chronoboost your Gateways, set up several proxy Pylons around your opponent?s third base, and stop all Probe production.

If you are choosing to play the macro game, then only use the attack to hopefully deal a bit of damage while you continue producing Probes and teching at home. Getting a Twilight Council, all of your gasses, and going for a +2 Blink Stalker army is a good choice.  Alternatively, you can start a Robotics Facility, all of your gasses, and go straight for Colossi.

Tips

- Spend all of your early game chronoboost on your two Nexus to maximize Probe production.
- Keep your Mothership Core out in front of your natural to help ward off any scouting Zerglings.
- Until you are ready to attack, position your Sentries and Zealot very defensively. Staying against buildings or walls will increase the effectiveness of defensive force fields dramatically.
- Use 2 of your Gateways to wall-in a Photon Cannon while your third base is being set up. A Cannon that cannot be targeted by Zerglings is incredibly effective at stopping runbys.
- Be sure to start moving out before +1 actually finishes in order to hit your opponent as early as possible.
- Constantly warp-in Stalkers with the attack, using your initial 8 Sentries to keep back enemy Roach/Ling armies.
- Don?t forget to mass recall your army back home if you end up getting surrounded.

Pros and Cons

This build is an incredibly greedy build that initially powers economy hard and then transitions into a powerful 7 Gate attack. You have both a strong army and a strong economy.

This build opens with a Gateway Expand and then transitions into a very quick all-in with 2 Immortals, a Warp Prism, and a lot of +1 Zealots.

Scouting

After the early game, scouting is much more minimal than you might expect. As long as you can confirm your opponent is getting a third Hatchery, you should be able to go through with this build.

However, if your opponent scouts your Robotics Facility early on, then you can send your Warp Prism directly towards your opponent s base in order to both fake pressure and see what units/buildings they have made.  This Warp Prism poke provides a bit of scouting that may help you deduce what unit composition your opponent will try to defend your all-in with.

Transitions

If your opponent holds off your all-in without taking too much damage, then you will most likely lose the game soon after. That being said, starting more Assimilators and teching to either Colossi or Blink Stalkers (depending on what unit composition your opponent used to defend your all-in) for a second desperation all-in might just be enough to win the game.

Tips

- The limiting factor in this build is the Robotics Facility time. Be sure to chronoboost your Robotics Facility to get out the Warp Prism and Immortals in time for such a fast attack.
- Send your Warp Prism to your opponent s base as soon as it completes for both fake pressure and potential scouting information.
- When you move out for the attack, be sure to fully wall-off your natural expansion (and even potentially build some cannons) to stop your opponent from running around your army and going for a base trade.
- The most important part of the army are your Robotics units. Keep your Zealots all in front of your Immortals/Warp Prism so that they tank all (or most) incoming damage. Using the Warp Prism, pick up Immortals that are being targeted down to move them further back behind your Zealot meat shield. If your Warp Prism is being targeted down, bring it out of the fight and retreat a bit before warping in more Zealots.
- If your opponent is trying to defend with Roaches or Mutalisks and you have a little extra gas, then mix in some Stalkers into the mix for some extra DPS.

Pros and Cons

This is a strong all-in that hits before your opponent can have much tech out in order to end the game quickly. With +1 Zealots dealing lots of damage to Zerglings, and Immortals shredding up Roaches, this build walks through most Zerg defenses with ease.

However, none of your units are anti-air. Thus, if your opponent gets out Mutalisks before your attack has dealt lots of damage, then you will be in a lot of trouble. Also, losing a single Immortal or the Warp Prism due to poor micro can almost instantly lose you the game.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Nexus,MothershipCore,WarpgateUpgrade,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Probe,Forge,Gateway,Probe,Zealot,Probe,Probe,WarpPrism,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Immortal,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Immortal,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,Pylon,Observer,Chronoboost,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot,WarpInZealot', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:13 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'PartinG 3 gate blink', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'The most important part of this build is that it incorporates anMSCore scout. While this did get slightly nerfed with the new patch, so far it is still definitely possible to pull them off, however you just have to be a little bit careful.

The scout allows you to see exactly what tech you're going against since blink can be a little bit risky at times. Here's a general idea of what you can do vs some particular openings with this build:

Vs. Robo expands: So robo expands are tough builds to crack with blink openers. You really need to stretch them thin with blink and get a little fancy with warping in a sentry and force them into the main and forcefield them in to snipe the natural or visa versa etc. But you normally can't straight win vs robo expands an you'll just need to expand and probe behind it. For a little more in expanding out of blink openers in PvP check outDay9's daily #674.

Vs. Stargate openers: So generally this is where this build shines the most. You should be able to get in their while their unit count is low and screw them up. There isn't too much to say here except to remember about the potential oracle swinging in the back and ruining your day, as well as to not be too overeager with void ray #yolo blinks as you can find yourself losing quite quickly. Just be patient and mass a good stalker count and hit when you know it's right.

Vs. DTs: This is where the MSCore scout comes into play the most. When going vs DT's you're going to need to drop a robo ASAP (before or after blink depending on how quickly they made the dark shrine) and you're going to have to macro out of it. It's very difficult to break a DT opener with blink as you have to wait for multiple observers to know you're safe. Just poke and prod a bit and see what damage you can do while expanding yourself.

Vs. Blink: This is all up to micro. You have to simple be VERY careful about analyzing your stalker count in comparison to his before engaging and to micro your god damn heart out. Blink vs blink doesn't happen too often, but when it does it's literally about who has more stalkers, so you need to be extra crisp when this happens.

It's quite flexible to your standards so if you have a preference on how you like to open DT/robo then by all means do your own. I just modified the one that PartinG did in this particular game to have an earlier robo for safety (since he got his kinda late in this particular game) so that way you have an example.

The follow up is quite simple really. So long as you're playing vs passive players you can simple go up to templar archives for storm fairly quickly while being safe. There's not too much a 2 base protoss can do to punish. If you're scared they might do some kind of push you can just get archons faster and get some immortals earlier as well and you should be good. PartinG even gets 2 base all inned this game after his first storm drop and he can still hold after even trying to take a greedy 3rd.

The timings for the templar archives can vary based off of what happens in the early game.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'PartinG Fast 3 base 7 gate', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'So this starts with a greedy opener. It's a nexus first into gateway. If you don't want to play that greedy you can still do a similar version of the build off of a FFE, it'll just hit a tad later and you may want to just adapt it to be not as all in.

The build itself is quite simple. You get a fast nexus, go into 1 gate for sentry production to stay safe/build up energy, expand, make more gates, and then attack with mass sentry/stalker at an awkward time for the zerg to deal with. There isn't TOO much to explain with this one as it all comes down to execution.

There are a few reasons behind getting the fast 3rd even if you aren't actually transferring probes to it.

1) It fakes the zerg out. When they see that early of a Nexus they're going to do one of two things. They will either make mass units to try and kill it (which is fine since you're going to have 7 gates worth of production and a bunch of sentries) or they go heavy econ and drone up hard (which is also good because then they don't have units to defend the attack).

2) It provides a back up plan. If the attack doesn't go 100% as planned, you can always start making probes 3 at a time and transfer them down while starting to tech up. That way if things ever go wrong you aren't 100% all in (hence the "semi" from earlier).

3) Extra chronoboost for gateways. A small addition, however a nice one if you can spend your chronoboost well.

A small note that I feel would be a good addition to this build that coincides with the 2nd point above. I think as you are moving out (or as your +1 is finishing) you should get a twilight council as well. This makes it easier to transition into +2 blink and beyond if your initial pressure can't finish them off and since the build itself doesn't starve you for money, there is no harm in getting it.

The other benefit to this build is that you don't even have to all in with it if you don't want to. You can do the same opener and if you see the zerg being greedy and you want to play greedy too, then by all means go for it. You took a 6:50 3rd base. While I still suggest pressuring at least a little bit (to maybe deny the 4th) you can still be probing up constantly behind it and teching as well.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Polt 2 Reaper FE to Hellions-Viking-Medivac', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'Scouting

Because this build opens with as many different map control units as Terran has, there is no need for super early SCV scouting. Your initial scout comes from your Reaper(s) poking into your opponents base. Check for a lack of a natural, early gas, or any quick tech buildings. Consider cutting Hellions and getting Widow Mines instead if your opponent is going for a very early all-in.

The next scout comes from your Reapers and Hellions poking the front.  You should be able to spot a 3rd base and your opponents Queen count.  If you see a lack of Queens and no 3rd base, then be prepared for a 2 base all-in of sorts. Extra bunkers, a full wall-off, and Marauders/Siege Tanks are the best ways to defend most Roach or Baneling based all-ins.

Finally, your last scout comes from a Medivac drop and your Viking. Use your Viking to kill Overlords blocking your 3rd base or scouting around the map. You can also use the Viking to keep tabs on your opponents base count up until they have any anti-air (usually Mutalisks). Be sure not to lose the Viking to Queens, however, so stay off creep. Also, use your Medivac drop for map control at the front. Scan, kill creep, and pick up and leave with your 8 units up everywhere your opponent is spreading creep until your opponent has Mutalisks.

This build gets you map control in every way: initial ground control comes from your Reapers; follow-up ground control comes from your Reaper/Hellion pokes; follow-up air control comes from your Viking on Overlord-killing duty; and follow-up creep control comes from a squadron of Marine/Marauder in your Medivac. Be sure to use all of these to their fullest in order to have maximum scouting information.

Transitions

This build transitions well into both Marine/Tank or Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine. It can also transition into Mech, but anyone who watches Polt as a player knows that he never goes Mech in basically any matchup, so I have opted not to write-up the Mech transition.

For either transition, start Stimpack research and 2 Engineering Bays so that your midgame army will have some staying power on the field. Once you have minerals, throw down up to 7 Barracks and an extra Factory to reach the 3 base infrastructure that you need to out-produce your Zerg opponent. Start producing Siege Tanks or Widow Mines from your initial Factory to get a healthy unit count while you are building up your Bio army.

Lift up your third base and take your third once you feel safe, starting an Armory so as to continue your upgrades. Remember to stay on top of your huge mineral count. Because this build only stays on 3 buildings for unit production for quite some time, but gets you a similar income, your mineral income will seem much larger than you think. Start those Engineering Bays and Barracks as soon as you can afford them for a strong midgame army.

Tips

- Do NOT over commit your initial Reapers by trying to kill Drones. Use them more for scouting and prioritize keeping them alive so as to keep your opponents early game units back at home.
- Do NOT over commit your initial Reaper/Hellion poke by trying to kill Drones. Again, use them more for scouting and prioritize keeping them alive unless you see a huge opening that you can punish (such as spotting your opponents Queens off creep and knowing that your opponent does not have Zergling Speed).
- If you spot your opponent going all-in, then be sure to stop map-control-unit production and instantly begin Widow Mines and Marauders. Adding an extra Bunker and/or completing your wall-off at your natural will help provide buffers against any incoming attacks as well.
- When your Viking pops, be sure to shoot down as many Overlords as you can. Simply shift-queue up an attack route around all of your side of the map in order to kill any Overlords your opponent has that are off creep.
Use your initial Medivac and several Marines/Marauders for creep-killing duty. Scan, kill creep, and pick up and leave with your 8 units up everywhere your opponent is spreading creep until your opponent has Mutalisks. Try and pick off a Queen if you can.
- Once you throw down your 3rd Command Center, you are going to have A LOT of minerals. Be sure to transition quickly by starting the Engineering Bays, Barracks, and Refineries as soon as you can afford them.

Pros and Cons

This build is quite strong because of its ability to scout and harass early on.  With Reapers, Hellions, Vikings, and Medivacs all being used to take map control, and a 1/1/1 at home with the versatility to react to whatever units your opponent seems to be making, this build is also quite safe against any early all-ins that your opponent might try to do. Finally, if your opponent ever slips up and does not adequately prepare for your continuous production of map control units, you can quickly kill many Drones and take a huge economic advantage as what happens in game 5 of Polt vs HyuN.

However, this build is not quite as economical as a 3CC build such as Innovations Reactor/Hellion 3CC build. It also requires a lot of APM in order to micromanage all of your early game harassing/map control units while keeping up your macro at home. Finally, it delays Stimpack by several minutes when compared to most other builds, so all of your early aggression must come from Stimpack-less Bio units and your map control units.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Reaper,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,Factory,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Starport,LiftRaxFromReactor,LandFactoryOnReactor,DoubleHellions,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleHellions,SCV,Marine,Viking,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,Marine,SCV,DoubleWidowMines,SCV,SCV,Marine,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Marine,CommandCenter,Medivac,SCV', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:13 PM;

This cheese proxies your initial Pylon at your opponent?s natural and makes Stalkers 2 at a time from 2 proxied Gateways. This proxy Stalker Rush is a very effective cheese that focuses on early game micro to destroy your opponent before the midgame.

Scouting

This build skips all scouting, for you are placing your first Pylon proxied at your opponent?s natural expansion regardless of what your opponent is doing. All of your scouting will come from your initial attack with your first Gateway units. The build itself will not change regardless of what you scout ? only your unit positioning and micro.

Transitions

This proxy Stalker Rush is an all-in in every respect: proxying the initial Pylon at your opponent?s natural, cutting Probe production at 12, non-stop chronoboosting your Gateways, and skipping Warpgate Research. Thus, there is no well-defined transition. If you are late in your execution and do not outright kill your opponent (or at least take out their army and 10+ Probes), then you will most likely lose the game to any sort of Gateway attack follow-up.

Tips

- ALL OF YOUR CHRONOBOOST MUST BE DUMPED INTO YOUR GATEWAYS. The limiting factor on this build is how fast you can pump out units from your Gateways. Be sure to non-stop chronoboost your Gateways as they are producing the Zealot and later Stalkers so as to attack as early as possible.
- Poke in with your first Zealot and Probe and force your opponent to lose mining time. However, be wary of a Probe surround. Favor keeping the Zealot alive over killing enemy Probes.
- Once your first 2 Stalkers finish, you must commit to the attack as quickly as possible and never stop Stalker production until either you have won the game or you have lost all of your units. The strength of this all-in is how quickly and ferociously it attacks, but if you are not constantly attacking then your opponent?s economic advantage can destroy you.
- If your opponent pulls a lot of Probes to defend, be sure to back off and fight near the main ramp. Use your 18 Pylon to buffer damage and provide high ground vision for your Stalkers to shoot up the cliff.

Pros and Cons

This proxy Stalker Rush is a hyper-aggressive all-in that is able to get 2 Stalkers and 1 Zealot at your opponent?s base at 4:00. Because of how quickly this build attacks, it can punish most greedy PvP builds or players with poor micro with ease.
Unfortunately, this all-in can be scouted because your initial buildings must all be built in your opponent?s natural.  However, it being easy to scout and easy to defend are two fundamentally different things, so you can still win with this build quite often.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Gateway,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Zealot,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Stalker,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Stalker,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:13 PM;

This build rushes for Thors and a Medivac as fast as possible and then goes for a hilarious all-in with Thor Drops. There is no transition with this build  you pull all your SCVs and crush your opponent as soon as possible.

Scouting

There is no purpose scouting. You are going to do the same build no matter what, and it only wastes mining time to pull an SCV from the mineral line.

Transitions

There are no transitions from this all-in. Keep rallying Marines and your next Thor and all of your SCVs and hope it is enough to win the game.

Tips

- When your Medivac pops, load up your Thor and drop your opponent, trying to kill production or SCVs.
- Avoid fighting your opponents army with your initial Thor drop at all costs. Only engage your opponents army directly once your Marines and SCVs are in the fight as well.
- Make sure to pull around 10 SCVs and attack with all of your Marines when you start your 2nd Thor so that your 2 Thors, 12 Marines, and 10 SCVs all get to your opponents base at the same time.
- During the fight, surround your Thor(s) with SCVs and repair.
- Use your Marines for a bit of extra DPS as they sit behind your Thor(s), but the true power of this all-in comes from the fact that Thors being repaired take close to no damage from early game Terran units.

Pros and Cons

This build rolls over most 1rax FE builds. Also, its a hilarious all-in that straight up kills unprepared opponents or opponents who dont have good repair micro. Also, a huge pro is that this build IS A THOR DROP.

However, this build is very weak against Reapers because you only have 2 Marines to defend against Reapers in the early game. That being said, if you can ward off the Reapers without losing too many SCVs, you might still win because Thors are obviously strong against Reapers in direct fights.  This build is also very bad against Banshees, but its possible to win the base trade because Thors also destroy Banshees in an actual fight.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,Marine,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Factory,CallMule,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Armory,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,Starport,SCV,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,Thor,Medivac,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines,Thor,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:14 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Polt Gas First Banshee', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This gas first Banshee opener used by Polt and many other top level Korean Terrans opens with the fastest Cloaked Banshees possible. The Banshee(s) are used to stay safe against early attacks as well as harass your opponent, in order to get an economic advantage going into the midgame.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your Orbital Command to check whether or not your opponent is opening with Reapers. Against an opponent opening Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe; thus, you should try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or expanded at your natural with your first few Marines.

Your next scout will come with your Banshee. With this Banshee, you can check what your opponents opener is. Against another Banshee player, follow-up your first Banshee with a Raven (and then potentially Viking if extra anti-air is needed). Against a Hellbat dropping player, make a few Widow Mines to burrow defensively against any incoming drop, as you use several Banshees to out-harass him. Against a player going for a Widow Mine Drop, position your Marines defensively at home and be sure to have enough scans to deal with his Widow Mines. Building a Raven might be useful, but not until after you have 2 Banshees with which to harass your opponent.

Finally, be sure to keep an eye out on what midgame transition your opponent is doing. Look for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either all-in, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play quite easily.

For an all-in transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory and start Siege Tank production instantly. When you hit 2 or 3 Siege Tanks, grab all of your Marines (>20), your Banshees/Vikings, and attempt to break your opponents front with a slow siege push.

It is possible to go into Marine/Tank or Mech after a 3 Command Center follow-up if you are sure your opponent will not be going for any more early game pressure. Start a Raven in order to save enough minerals to afford 2 Command Centers and then transition into either Marine/Tank or Mech just as below.

When transitioning into macro Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production after you start a 2nd Command Center. That way you have enough defense early and later can have a strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use. Against 2rax Reaper, you should delay your Tech lab until your Factory has completed at least one Hellion. Otherwise you might straight up die before you even start your first Banshee.
- Watch for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop your Banshee as you enter your opponents base.  Cloak your Banshee as soon as you see any potential for burrowed Widow Mines.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that are undefended by a Turret. If you are transitioning to a 1/1/1 all-in, then be sure to target-fire Marines as well, for this directly strengthens your attack.
- Always favor keeping your Banshee(s) alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two. You can also repair a weakened Banshee at home with SCVs if you can keep it alive.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural.  You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This gas first Banshee build is an aggressive opener in TvT. Also, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for you are able to transition into an all-in, 3 Command Center play, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play. Also, this build requires a lot less APM than other TvT builds, so it can be very useful for lower league players.

However, this build is extraordinarily weak against early Reaper builds because you open with so few Marines. Also, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind your opponent in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades, especially if they open with a fast expansion. Finally, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,SCV,Factory,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,Refinery,SCV,Marine,Starport,TechLabOnFactory,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,LandStarportOnTechLab,Banshee,CloakingField,SCV,ReactorOnBarracks,CallMule,WidowMine,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Banshee,DoubleMarines', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:14 PM;

This safe fast expand build opens with a 1gate FE and then transitions into Colossi and double upgrades as fast as possible in order to go into the late game with an upgrade and tech advantage over a Terran opponent.

Benchmark: @100% +1/+1 (@10:30ish), you should have around 55 Probes, 1 Sentry, and 2 Colossi.

Scouting

This is a very safe macro build, getting you enough units in the early game for scouting or defensive purposes, so Probe scouting is usually unnecessary.  If your opponent sends a Reaper at your base, then be defensive with your initial Zealot/Stalker, and use only your Mothership Core to scout around.  If your opponent does NOT send a Reaper at your base, then poke out with your initial Zealot/Stalker and later Mothership Core to poke at your opponent?s front and glean some information about their build.

While your early game is completely safe, therefore making Probe scouting irrelevant, the early midgame is not, and thus scouting is crucial. If you know that your opponent is going for a Widow Mine drop, then get out Observers and several more Stalkers and place them defensively in each mineral line. Be prepared to use the Mothership Core?s Photon Overcharge on whichever Nexus your opponent chooses to drop. Delay Colossus tech in order to favor more units to deal with the harass. This same reaction works against all early drop-based or Banshee play. Against any early frontal assaults, simply Planetary Nexus your natural expansion and warp-in several more units.

Transitions

This build is quite macro-oriented, so playing for the long-game is crucial.  Against standard Bio play, Bio/Mine play, or Bio/Hellbat play, take your third base after your 3rd Colossus and transition into Chargelots, Archons, and Storm. Add more Gateways as your minerals permit. Also, Blink is a good upgrade to prioritize against heavy drop play on maps with a large distance between your main and third bases.

Against Mech play, take your third base and begin heavy Immortal production.  Make Immortals, Archons, and High Templar while on 3 bases, and focus on hitting a +3/+3 timing attack before your opponent is maxed.  Add more Robotics Facilities as your gas permits.

Pros and Cons

This build stays safe against early shenanigans as you macro up and tech straight for Colossus and +1/+1. It also gives you the infrastructure necessary to defend early drops or harassment common in this matchup.  With your upgrade lead and tech advantage, you can safely transition into the lategame by safely taking another base and going for Storm.

Tips

- Chronoboost your initial Nexus to get out as many probes as early as possible to kick start your economy.
- Use your initial units defensively if you spot a Reaper, or aggressively to scout your opponent?s base if no Reaper appears at your door by the time your Stalker has popped.
- Send your first Observer directly to your opponent?s base in order to see if he?s opening with fast Widow Mines/harassing units, or teching up to a normal Bio timing. Only warp-in units before you get your first Colossus out if you scout your opponent playing aggressively. Delay your Colossus tech and production if you spot your opponent going for a quick drop or early attack play. Instead, focus on making Gateway units and Observers and placing them defensively to maintain your economic advantage. However, if your opponent is NOT attacking early, always prioritize economy and teching up over making Gateway units
- Never underestimate the power of making your Nexus a Planetary Nexus.  At the very least, it is a way to scare off a drop from doing economic damage if your army is out of position.
- Against early drops, target firing the Medivac with your Stalkers and Planetary Nexus can mean the difference between letting your opponent escape and crushing a poorly planned drop.
- Don?t forget to use your Mothership Core?s Time Warp spell against any 2 base Bio timings in order to keep your Colossus safe.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Zealot,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,Chronoboost,WarpgateUpgrade,Probe,Probe,Probe,Nexus,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Pylon,Probe,RoboticsFacility,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Observer,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Observer,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,RoboticsBay,Probe,Chronoboost,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Forge,Forge,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,GroundWeaponsLevel1,GroundArmorLevel1,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,ExtendedThermalLance,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,TwilightCouncil,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Colossus,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:14 PM;

This Reaper FE gets out a lot of units quickly in order to defend any Oracle or Blink Stalker attacks, while transitioning directly into completely standard 2 Base bio infrastructure. The versatility of this build sets it apart from the other TvP openers: Polts build lets you defend, attack, or play off any shenanigans your opponent may through at you.

Scouting

This build has a fragile beginning (you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they get an expansion (or note if they do not expand by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Extra Bunkers and/or an Engineering Bay for defense may be a smart investment.

If your opponent is going for a 2 Base Blink Stalker attack, then slow down your tech and gas income in favor of more units and more Bunkers. Start 2 Bunkers at the front and be ready to repair them with SCVs while you buy time for Combat Shields, more Marauders, and eventual Medivacs to pop.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and a large Bio army.  As you are taking map control with your initial Medivacs, be sure to add a 3rd Command Center, 2 more Barracks, and finish getting Concussive Shells and Combat Shields. Add on another Engineering Bay and an Armory to continue your upgrades as soon as you can afford it.

Note that you can switch the order of the 4th and 5th Barracks with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost and the scary late game Protoss army, most Terrans have been getting their infrastructure up early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having extra reinforcements.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important; if you keep all of your SCVs in gas, then you will not have the minerals to get your Command Center or extra Barracks at the correct time.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper.  Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add up to 2 Bunkers at the front, and start that Marauder production as soon as possible.
- Oracles massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you should consider skipping Marauders for more Marines or even start an emergency Engineering Bay for one turret per mineral line.
- Polt sometimes goes for an optional poke with his initial Marauder and several Marines if he has confirmed his opponent is not going for a Stargate. Be sure to keep these units alive  their only purpose is to take up a central XelNaga Watch tower
- When transitioning into the midgame, setting up your infrastructure while being aggressive with your first few Medivacs can outright win you the game.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because of the versatility inherent in its play. It makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game, gets up enough infrastructure to deal with all early and midgame attacks such as Oracle all-ins or Blink Stalker Timings, and then transitions into a completely standard bio midgame. It truly is an effective build to learn if you want to play safe and standard in TvP.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes if you lose your Reaper.

Everything about the opener is extremely safe (besides the late MSCore which can easily be added in if you suspect some form of 2 base all in) and completely standard. It even incorporates an early zealot just in case. If you want you can get rid of the zealot if you know 100% that they won't be doing any form of speedling bust or whatever so that way you can get all the timings slightly quicker. However, for the added security the early zealot gives you outweighs getting the pressure at their base 5 seconds earlier for the most part. The build also gives off a very normal feel. A zerg will easily look at this and think it's a standard every day phoenix into colossus passive macro opening. This helps in with the attack later on.

There have been other variants of this kind of build that are slightly more all in, (sentry drop version, 7 gate version etc.) where if you do enough damage you'll be fine to macro out if you can't out right kill them however if you get shut down completely you're basically lose.This version only has 4 gates and zealots and gets a quicker robo bay in exchange so that way it still packs a big punch with the +1 and 8 zealots at once (4 warped in before loaded up and 4 warped in on location) while not needing to do an excessive amount of damage to be able to macro out of it afterwords.

In regards to actually macroing out of it, it's quite simple. Just start colossus production as your harassment is going on so that way if he tries to counter attack if the attack is held then you'll have something to defend a 3rd base easily.

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and a large Bio army.  Before you focus on your attack, be sure to start a Factory for a standard Reactored Medivac follow-up. After the attack, get a 3rd Command Center, 2 more Barracks (for a total of 5), 2 Engineering Bays, and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to head into a strong, late game army.

Note that you can switch the order of the 4th and 5th Barracks with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost and the scary late game Protoss army, most Terrans have been getting their infrastructure up early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having extra reinforcements.

Tips

- The gas timing of this build is quite important; if you keep all of your SCVs in gas, then you will not have the minerals to get your Command Center or extra Barracks at the correct time.
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add up to 2 Bunkers at the front, and start that Marauder production as soon as possible.
- Oracles massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you should consider skipping Marauders for more Marines or even start an emergency Engineering Bay for one turret per mineral line. Note that even if your opponent does early game damage with an Oracle, your 9 minute attack can still end the game if your opponents follow-up is not executed precisely.
- Be sure to move out with your army BEFORE Stimpack and Combat Shields finish. You want to be attacking your opponents natural expansion as soon as those two upgrades finish.
- If your opponent is out of position, you can kill their entire army or snipe their natural expansion. However, be sure that you focus fire one or the other down  losing too much DPS by having your units attack both the Nexus and the army is the main way to screw up the attack.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because of how many units you can get out for a pre-10 minute attack. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Therefore, this build is a much more aggressive variant of the other Reaper expands possible in TvP.

However, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that with such a low Marine count in the early game, fast Oracles can do a lot of damage if your scouting is not perfect.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,GoOutScv,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn3Seconds,MineralScv,MineralScv,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Barracks,SCV,DoubleMarines,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,SCV,DoubleMarines,OrbitalCommand,SCV,TechLabOnBarracks,DoubleMarines,StimPack,Marine,SCV,SupplyDepot,CallMule,SCV,Refinery,Marine,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,CombatShield,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,Marauder,Marauder,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,CallMule,Factory,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,Marauder,SCV,SCV,Marauder,DoubleMarines,Starport,Refinery,ReactorOnFactory,EngineeringBay,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,CallMule,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,LiftFactoryFromReactor,LandStarportOnReactor,DoubleMedivacs,CallMule,Marauder,Marauder,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,InfantryWeaponsLevel1', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:14 PM;

This Reaper FE gets out a fast Factory so that you can defend any early Protoss pressure with Widow Mines and Bunkers. It then transitions into standard Bio play for a 10 minute Medivac attack.

Scouting

The very beginning of this build is somewhat fragile (opening with a Reaper FE means that you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper.  Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they expand (or note if they do not get a fast expansion by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponents first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.

If your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play as you sacrifice your Reaper into your opponents base. If you are playing against a 1 basing Protoss, then constantly produce Widow Mines  do not just stop at 1. Also, if you do not know whether or not your opponent has built a Stargate, building a Bunker in your main mineral line for 4 Marines to sit in and shoot any early game Oracles is not a bad idea too.

Push out when your first set of Medivacs finish (@10:10ish) with 3 Medivacs, around 6 Marauders and 26 Marines, and 53 SCVs at home

Transitions

This build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and Medivacs. After this build, get Concussive Shells, take a 3rd Command Center, continue your upgrades by getting and Armory and another Engineering Bay, build 2 more Barracks, and react to whatever midgame splash damage your opponent is getting. Against Colossi, get a 2nd Starport; against Storm, get a Ghost Academy.

Tips

- If you are not comfortable with pulling SCVs in and out of gas, then simply ignore the two notes telling you to pull an SCV out of and then later put one more into gas (at 15 and 22 supply).
- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper.  Do NOT lose your Reaper.
- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), then continue making Widow Mines.  Also, consider moving your natural to your main base and defending on one base.
- Oracles massacre un-upgraded Marines, so position your Widow Mines effectively.  Also consider adding a Bunker in your mineral line if your opponent has a Stargate to further defend Oracle pressure.
- If your opponent is not playing aggressively, then drop your Widow Mine(s) and Marines at your opponents base.  Do not over commit if your opponent already has a detection/Cannons ready for you.
- This build gives you enough gas to start Marauder production much earlier than most other builds.  Be sure to ramp up your Marauder production early in order to make a beefier army than your opponent.
- Move out as soon as your Medivacs pop.  Stimpack, while not yet done, should finish by the time you get to your opponents base.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong because it gives you the economy and infrastructure on par with a Wings of Liberty style 1rax FE. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Not to mention the fact that you start Widow Mine production very early in order to stay safe against any potential Protoss aggression.

However, this build is somewhat vulnerable to early Protoss pokes, especially if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that you start Stimpack a little later than other builds that go directly for Stimpack research, but you will still have Stimpack done for the 10 minute Medivac timing.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Reaper,OrbitalCommand,MineralScv,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,CommandCenter,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,Bunker,SCV,DoubleMarines,GasScv,Factory,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,OrbitalCommand,DoubleMarines,SCV,Starport,WidowMine,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,CallMule,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,Medivac,CallMule,DoubleMarines,Barracks,Barracks,SCV,SCV,Refinery,Refinery,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,TechLabOnStarport,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,EngineeringBay,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,ScannerSweep,SCV,SCV,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,LiftStarportFromTechLab,LandRaxOnTechLab,LandRaxOnTechLab,StimPack,CombatShield,SCV,SCV,ReactorOnStarport,CallMule,SupplyDepot,InfantryWeaponsLevel1,SCV,SCV,Marauder,Marauder,DoubleMarines,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,DoubleMedivacs,Marauder,CallMule,DoubleMarines,Marauder,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,CallMule,Marauder,DoubleMarines,Marauder', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:15 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Roach-Bane All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This Roach/Baneling all-in takes advantage of greedy Terran play by hitting a Terran before his midgame infrastructure can be set up with a huge swell of Roaches and Banelings.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of very early force, make a few Speedlings to stay safe. However, do NOT overproduce early game units because this will slow down your push.
Your next scout will be with an Overlord as soon as you start your Roach Warren (around 6:30). This is merely to scout whether your opponent is opening with Hellbats. If he is, then do not produce more than 1 wave of Banelings ? favor Roaches to defend your Drones at home as you attack the front with the same push.
The next scout will be with your initial Roach Warren attack. Try to force a Widow Mine to detonate with a Speedling or two before you commit to the attack. Also, with your all-in, you will see what units your opponent has because all of them must be at the front in order to defend.

Transitions

Because this build is an all-in, there is no true transition to this build. However, once you destroy at least one base of SCVs, you can transition out of the attack and get economically ahead. Drone up your 3rd base and continue into a macro game, instead of pushing up the main ramp in a potentially bad engagement.
If you do choose to drone up, start 2 Evolution Chambers and a Lair instantly, along with your 3rd and 4th Extractors. You?ll likely want +1 Melee over +1 Ranged, though you have the option to transition into any composition involving any combination of Zerglings/Banelings/Roaches that you are most comfortable with.
The obvious transition would be to hit a follow-up push on 3 bases with +1 Melee and +1 Carapace, with both Roach and Baneling Speed. This should hit around 13:30, only 3:30 later than a straight 3base Lair tech Roach/Baneling bust.

Tips

- Hide your Roaches for as long as possible before you move out. The less time you give your opponent to react to your build, the better your chance at crushing through their front.
- Make a bunch of Overlords BEFORE you need to make all of your units. Making Overlords during a fight is a sure way to get supply blocked.
- Use Banelings to bust a wall at the natural. Then, all high priority Baneling targets are: packs of Marines/SCVs, researching Tech labs, and the central structure on the top of the ramp.
- Do NOT over commit your Roaches if you are waiting on a second wave of Banelings to morph. It is completely fine to pull back whilst you wait for another round of Banelings. Zerglings and Banelings can be replaced; your Roaches cannot.
- Do NOT over commit up your opponent?s main ramp unless you are absolutely sure that you can push through and win the game with the attack. Favor droning up your 3rd base and transitioning into a macro game over potentially taking a bad engagement up the main ramp.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any player going for a Tank-less 3 Command Center build (the current metagame). Also, because you take your third base before moving out, it is easy to stop Zergling/Baneling production and saturate your third base in order to transition into a standard 3 base Zerg vs 2 base Terran macro game. Also, as a Zerg player, the engagement itself is quite easy to micro.
However, if you cannot do damage with the Roach/Bane attack, then you will be economically behind the Terran opponent. Also, because it is an all-in, this build is quite difficult to transition out of.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Drone,SpawningPool,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,MetabolicBoost,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Queen,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,RoachWarren,Extractor,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Overlord,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,SpawnCreepTumor,BanelingNest,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:15 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Sage Blink All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with some light Stalker pressure and then follows up with a 3gate Blink Stalker all-in, using the Mothership Core for high ground vision and Time Warp.

Blink into the main when Blink finishes (@7:40ish) with 12 Stalkers and 25 Probes at home.

Scouting

This build is an aggressive opener that makes a lot of units, so you will not have to worry about Probe scouting. Against Reaper play, keep your first Stalker on a common hop-up ledge in order to deny your opponent scouting the Twilight Council. Against other defensive play, poke out to your opponent?s front with your first Stalker and check to see whether your opponent is going for Widow Mines or a quick CC into Bio so you know how to micro when you Blink into his main base with all of your units.

Transitions

This build is an all-in, so there is no standard follow-up. If your attack does damage and you keep most of your units alive, then you can take a natural expansion and transition into Upgrades+Storm. However, if you do not do significant damage with your initial Stalkers and also lose them, you are most likely out of the game because your midgame tech and economy will be vastly behind that of your opponent.

Tips

- Do not bother Probe scouting, you can do this build against nearly everything your opponent chooses to open with.
- With your initial Stalkers, either protect your main base from a Reaper scouting your Twilight Council or move out and poke up at your opponent?s base for some early scouting intel.
- The limiting factor with this build is Blink Research?s build time, so be sure to Chronoboost that Research constantly in order to attack as soon as possible.
- Keep your Mothership Core out of harm?s way. Use its 14 sight range for high ground vision, but do not commit the Mothership Core in the attack because without high ground vision, your attack will most likely fail.
- Do not forget to use your Mothership Core?s Time Warp ability to help pick off SCVs or Bio units that are out of position.
- Do NOT over-commit your Stalkers in a risky blink. Only aggressively blink to get up to a high ground or to pick off a Siege Tank/Widow Mine before it activates.
- Constantly warping-in more Stalkers to reinforce your army and add strength to the attack is key to crushing through your opponent?s defenses.

Pros and Cons

This build is a strong build because of how quickly you get both high ground vision with your Mothership Core and enough Blink Stalkers to do real damage.

However, this build is in fact an all-in, so there is no standard transition should the attack fail.

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Scarlett Macro Mutalisk Style', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

The definitive macro build of modern ZvT, Scarlett?s fast 3 Hatch style quickly transitions into the most commonly used composition of Zergling, Baneling, Mutalisk. Utilizing a gasless opener with a high Queen count and fast upgrades, this is by far the best build with which to learn ZvT.

Scouting

First scout with your initial Zerglings. Use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of very early force, make a few Zerglings to stay safe. However, do NOT overproduce early game units because this will slow down your 3 base saturation, and thus your midgame strength. Your next scout will be with an Overlord just after you start your +1/+1 (@7:15ish). This is merely to scout whether your opponent is opening with 3 base Bio play, 3 base Mech play, or a 2 base timing. If your opponent is going Mech, immediately abandon this build. Zerglings and Banelings are highly ineffective against Hellbats, Hellions, and Siege Tanks, so begin violently tech switching based off of Terran?s composition; Mutalisks for Tanks, Swarm Hosts for Hellbat Thor, etc. Continuing Mutalisk production is fine, but be sure to take a much earlier 5th base and Infestation Pit, as well as a Roach Warren. If your opponent is opening bio, proceed as the build dictates.

Transitions

As soon as you confirm that your opponent is going for a 3rd Command Center, feel free to start your 4th Hatchery. Against Mech play, transitioning into Swarm Hosts, Mutalisks, or Vipers is very strong. Against Bio/Mine play, transitioning into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk or mass Zergling/Baneling is also quite strong. Assuming you have not scouted Mech, your transition into standard Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk should serve you fine against any bio based composition. Emphasize Zerglings against Bio/Mine, Banelings against Bio/Hellbat, and Mutalisks against Marine/Tank.

Tips

- Be sure that you take map control with your initial Zerglings. Being able to spot when and with what your opponent moves out on the map can be crucial in defending any early timings.
- Metabolic Boost will not finish until just before 8 minutes with this build. If your opponent is hitting you very early, then a Spine Crawler and/or extra Queens will be more useful than slow Zerglings.
- As above, beware Reapers pressuring the Drone that attempts to take your 3rd base. You will have to defend it cautiously with Queens and your slower Zerglings. This is where creep spread will greatly assist you.
- Just after you start your +1/+1 upgrades, be sure to send a sacrificial Overlord into your opponent?s base to check whether your opponent is going for a Mech or Bio build.
- Against a Banshee based opener, over-produce Queens and conserve energy for Transfuses, without compromising either your creep spread or your injects too much.
- Be aware of the flow of each Terran composition. For example, Bio/Mine typically means non stop aggression, so usage of static defense to buy time and Mutalisks to intercept reinforcements is critical.
- Mutalisks are prioritized in this build over the other two components; Zerglings and Banelings. It is important to be as active with them as possible without compromising your macro.
- Against Bio/Mine, engage in small groups whenever possible to abuse the long cooldown of Widow Mines to the maximum effect.
- Against Bio/Hellbat/Thor, be sure to emphasize a ground army instead of a Mutalisk based composition. More Banelings and a faster hive are highly recommended, and be sure to fight on creep to get the best possible Baneling connections.
- Be aware of the standard creep clearing push that every bio Terran executes between 10 to 12 minutes, using their first two Medivacs, 15 to 25 Marines with Combat Shield/Stimpack, and the survivors of the Reaper/Hellion squad; be sure to have Banelings ready to defend, and surrender non essential creep tumors (any tumors placed upon paths he will not attack on).
- Using the Mutalisks to deny the fourth base as long as possible is critical to victory. Because you have made so many Mutalisks, your own Hive Tech will be delayed, so you must delay Terran as long as possible in turn.
- The build gets looser and more flexible as the game goes on, as is to be expected. As you are first trying out this build, you will either be far too greedy, and die with too many Drones, or far too safe, and die with not enough Drones. Constantly adjust the ratio of Drones to units based upon what you scout and the flow of the game, and learn the precise moments when you are completely free to Drone, and when you are not to maximize your success with this build.

Pros and Cons

This build is strong against almost all standard Terran openers. It gets 4 Queens for safety, injects, creep spread, and to defend a very quick 3rd Hatchery. With such a fast third, your midgame economy is also quite solid. This build is also currently viewed as the best way to play macro ZvT. It has no inherent weaknesses, and thus will always guarantee that the better player wins the game.
However, because you delay your Extractors in favor of 4 Queens, this build is not as safe against 1 Base all-ins than an opener that gets a very fast Metabolic Boost. Additionally, because you are opening gasless, Reaper openers have to be defended purely with Queens and your Terran opponent may be more inclined to play much greedier than he normally would against a gas opener.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Queen,InjectLarva,Queen,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Hatchery,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Overlord,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,EvolutionChamber,EvolutionChamber,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,MeleeAttacksLevel1,GroundCarapaceLevel1,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Lair,SpawnCreepTumor,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,BanelingNest,Drone,Hatchery,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Spire,PneumatizedCarapace,Hatchery,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,CentrifugalHooks,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,MeleeAtacksLevel2,GroundCarapaceLevel2,Overseer,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,Overlord,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Baneling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Extractor,Extractor,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,FlyerCarapaceLevel1,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:15 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'sOs Hallucination 3gate Blink', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'This build is a much safer variant of blink and can respond to absolutely any build they would go for. The build stays defensive with the early units and MSCore so that you don't die to any sort of proxies/cheese and then uses a 5:45 hallucination to scout exactly what tech they're going for.

With this build DTs are a tad tricky though, so I added in my own little idea to stay safe vs them. At 6:00 is when you normally drop a robo to be safe vs DTs in a standard blink/obs build, however the hallucination scout doesn't normally get into their base until 20-30 seconds after that time has passed. This can lead to straight up losses due to not having a robo up in time. So since you have the money to make the robo at 6:00 still with this build it's a good idea to make it incase of DTs (especially if your early probe scout sniffed out DT tech) and then once your hallucination scouts their base you can cancel it if you see no evidence of DTs being made and react accordingly. You can also keep it if you want and do an even safer version of the build, however it will hinder your aggressive options and delay your nexus a bit.

If they go stargate then you can easily drop a 4th gate and go all in with blink. Be sure to leave the MSCore home to defend against oracles and use the hallucination from the sentry a 2nd time to get vision into their main to blink in there and catch them by surprise.

If they go blink as well then you'll need to gauge the situation. It's best to just make some stalkers and keep some form of map presence as you can and then expand behind it while getting a robo. This is where keeping the 6 minute robo is an OK decision because then you can go into immortals faster for a more defensive option incase he decides to all in with blink. There's also the off chance that they hid the dark shrine and you don't see it so keeping the robo after seeing a twilight only is still fine.

The cool thing with this build that CranK told me to do is to proxy a stargate for an oracle if you see them open greedier than you. This makes perfect sense since the only real downside to opening macro blink builds is that it's hard to pressure them and get ahead if they open for a greedier build than you. The initial blink stalkers will force them into stopping probes and going defensive for fear of a blink all in, however in the mean time an oracle is being made close to their base. They most likely will use overcharge at their natural as well so the main is left completely undefended for the oracle. All this time you were making probes and expanding yourself and all of a sudden you're on even footing once more. You can also take a greedier 3rd base since the oracle/blink combo will keep them on the defensive even more so than any other normal build.

Once you get your expansion up you can continue in whatever way you please whether that be with a fast +2 chargelot/immortal/archon all in or with standard colossus play.

5:45Send hallucination to scout
6:00 Robo (in case of DTs. Cancel after your hallucination scouts if you see no DTs)

When hallucination gets into their base:
- If see greedier opening: 35 Proxy stargate --> Oracle

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'SaSe DT Rush', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This DT rush opens with a 3 Stalker Rush for safety and map control, and then gets out fast DTs either for offense (taking advantage of your opponent?s possible lack of detection early on) or defense (applying pressure while you safely take an expansion of your own).

Scouting

This build is a pretty unsafe build in general, only giving you 3-5 units for the early game timings, thus scouting is huge. However, because this build was created by SaSe, you are also low on minerals for quite some time and thus cannot afford losing mining time by scouting with a Probe.  Therefore, in the early game merely scout in your base for a proxy Gateway with the Probe who builds the 2nd Pylon; the rest of your scouting will come from your 3 Stalkers. Being active with these 3 Stalkers around your natural, third, and watchtower will prevent your opponent from sneaking proxy Pylons past you and hitting you with a very early Gateway attack. Thus, you will be able to see an incoming push coming before it?s too late, and can delay/cancel your fast expand in favor of more units if you need to.

Transitions

This build transitions very smoothly into Chargelot/Archon builds or Blink Stalker builds. To make either transition, first resume chronoboosting out probes from both Nexi and then start your research of choice (Charge or Blink). Adding on 2 more Gateways, and applying midgame pressure with lots of Gateways and 1 or 2 Archons is a great way to force units out of your opponent, scout what midgame tech he?s going, and possibly end the game if your DTs did too much damage.

Pros and Cons

This build is great because it gets a reasonably timed expansion, gives you DTs early for map control and potential game-ending damage, and lets you transition into an aggressive midgame with either Chargelots or Blink Stalkers at the core of your army composition.
However, this build is very weak vs Oracle openers, for they give both detection and a great way to harass your naked mineral line. Also, against early attacks that hit before your Dark Shrine finishes, if you miss the proxy Pylon because you are not active enough with your first three stalkers, you can straight up lose the game.

This Speedling all-in is a cheese designed to hard and blind-counter a Gateway Expanding Protoss player in the current metagame. It also has varying success against a FFE, depending on your opponent?s building placement.

Scouting

You only need to Drone scout for the Protoss on a 4 player map such as Whirlwind or Red City. Your early Spawning Pool prevents you from having the minerals to scout with a Drone on any other map. Instead of scouting with your units, the vast majority of your scouting will come from your initial Overlords? vision. Also, you do not need to scout for any Protoss cheeses because cheese should counter any of their cheeses quite effectively.

Transitions

Because this build is straight-up cheese, there is no true transition to this build. However, if you do damage and want to continue into a macro game, take a natural Hatchery and start a 2nd Queen to play a 2base, map control play style.

Tips

- Position your Overlords to give you vision of your opponent?s walls. Attacking the holes in your opponent?s building placement is crucial with this build, but that can only be easily done once you have vision of these holes.
- Use your initial 6 Zerglings to do as much damage as possible, along with scouting the Protoss for unusual play.
Avoid placing your Zerglings in a position where they can be surrounded by Probes and/or Zealots. Always retreat and poke in another area instead of committing to a bad position to get a guaranteed kill on a single target.
- Avoid a-clicking with your Zerglings. Rather, pick a target, move behind it to surround it, and then attack-move or target-fire the individual unit for a quick kill.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against any Protoss player going for a Gateway Expand (the current metagame).  It is designed to do potentially game-winning damage against any player with sub-optimal building placement and Probe control.
However, it is significantly weaker against a Forge Fast Expanding player, for your Zerglings can only do damage where there are no Photon Cannons or wall-offs.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Extractor,Drone,Overlord,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn10Seconds,StartIdle,StopIdleIn5Seconds,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MineralDrone,MetabolicBoost,Queen,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Overlord,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:15 PM;

The build is a very straight forward 13 gate 15 double gas opener with3 on eachthat gets a Stargate right when the Cyber is done and then a MSCore for obvious reasons. Something that sOs doesn't do in his build is get an early stalker. I feel like it's a bit risky/greedy to do this and I feel more comfortable adding the stalker in, so I did. The small impact this has is that your 3rd phoenix will have a delay on it. It's not the biggest of deals in my opinion and I feel like it's better to feel safer with the early stalker to help try to scout for proxies and whatnot.

The robo comes early enough so that way DTs are not a problem at all. You'll easily be able to scout the dark shrine with your phoenix, the observer should come out right as the DT is getting to your base andyou can easily lift itand not lose a single unit. From there you'll have free reign over his probe line with your phoenix.

For the most part you should be getting your Nexus as early as possible right after the first warp in. Unless you think they're doing a 1 base all in there's no real reason to start the immortal before the nexus. In sOs' game vs Creator it seemed like he wasn't 100% certain if Creator was going to try and blink all in or not, so he played it safe and got the immortal before the nexus.

Reactions to certain builds

Early gateway timings

These are the only tricky things to stop with this build. Since you're not really making any units it's obvious that a 4gate might be a little hard to stop. The best thing you can really do is to identify that it's happening asap (with your probe scout) and prepare by getting3gates of your own and going intovoid rays. You'll have to use overcharge to buy timefor everything to finish and you'll need some fancy micro. Don't be afraid topull probes right awayto catch him off guard and get a surround off. Early probe pulls can be really good since their unit count isn't totally out of control and it can really swing the edge in your favor quickly since 4gates really only have 2 warp in cycles or so until they stop being effective. This will also force them to back away and allow your void ray to stay targeted for a while dealing out some extra damage. It'll have to be a dance, but it's definitely possible.

Stargate openers

It's really quite simple. If your stargate is faster than theirs and you get the phoenix out first, you should win easily. Take control of the skies and force them onto the ground and you can either follow up by taking an early nexus and harassing like normal, or throwing down 2 extra gates and try ending it with a phoenix/gateway all in. This is very effective since they will only have gateway tech available to them since the tech they invested in got shut down completely. If you get 4-5 phoenix and just lift up 4-5 units, all of a sudden half his army isn't in the fight and it's an easy win.

If their stargate is faster than yours, be sure to identify that right away. This stargate is basically the fastest possible off a normal opening, so the only thing faster than yours is an 11 gate stargate which you should be able to scout before you even drop you own stargate. So you canswitch to blinkif you want and go from there.

Blink openers

This is also quite simple since you are getting such a fast robo. Make sure to identify whether they're going for an all in or a macro build. If it's an all in, then simply start making immortals ASAP and chrono them out while using the phoenix to deny any high ground vision and just forcefield for days. They will probablytry to contain you, so keep the phoenix alive. Once you have a few immortals you canlift the sentriesthey have so you can bust down the ramp and force them away and take an expansion. Try to do this as early as possible so their expansion isn't too far ahead of yours and so they don't have like 3-4 sentries there.

Early robo expands

While they will have a faster expansion than you,you have full map control. This is where this build truly shines. Three phoenix can do wonders to a mineral line that's not easily defended. Even though their expansion will be quicker, it won't even matter because of the amount of damage you can do with your phoenix. The amount of resources required to defend 2 mineral lines from phoenix is a huge hit that early and it will really fuck with their timings for anything else. You can play completely greedy behind the phoenix and just chrono probes and get a quick forge and everything.You have full control of the gamein this situation.

Transition to mid game

Once you have your expansion then the rest is up to you really. The few things you 100% will need shortly after the nexus goes down are aforge, robo bay or twilight council, natural gasses.The build leaves you in control with the phoenix and gives you full scouting potential so it's very easy to react to what he's doing. Once you identify that they're going macro you need to put a forge down ASAP so you don't fall behind on upgrades. Shortly after that should be your tech of choice (whether it be colossi or twilight for immortal/archon). I personally prefer colossi since you already have the robo and it's a much quicker and safer transition. Twilight takes a little long and also diversifies your tech a little too much. You'll be spreading yourself too thin and if you realize that they're going to do some 2 base timing to kill you shortly after your nexus is up then you're going to have a hard time defending since you won't really have anything to defend with. From there you just play a standard macro PvP really.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Stargate,WarpgateUpgrade,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Pylon,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Phoenix,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Pylon,Phoenix,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Probe,Phoenix,Chronoboost,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,WarpInSentry,WarpInZealot,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Immortal,Chronoboost,Probe,Nexus', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:16 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Stats 11gate 3gate into DT', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'Build starts with an 11 gate. The 11 gate gets out a fast chronoboosted stalker and if your opponent isn't paying attention (most of the time they aren't) you'll be able to kill their scouting probe with the stalker and keep them completely in the dark. With that first stalker you can then easily take watch towers and look around the map to find any other hidden probes they may send out, or even catch the MSCore across the map if they try to scout you that way. The 11gate stalker really gives you a lot ofearly game map control so please use that to its advantage.

The attack itself should go pretty normally. Use the first stalker to poke up a bit after you scout around the map. This will let you know if they expanded early or not. Don't fully commit until you have both stalkers though (especially against double gate openers) since it's pretty easy to get caught out with it. The fact that you're 3gating and that you're making stalkers will really trip your opponent off. The last thing on their mind will be DTs hitting with the next warp in. So be sure to get stalkers instead of zealots. You'll have enough gas even while making stalkers so don't think you won't be able to warp them in with 2 rounds of stalkers.

One tricky thing to deal with is proxy oracle. Since this build skips the MSCore you won't have any defense back at home while you're doing your attack. The key to stopping this is scouting. You need to identify that he's proxying SOMETHING as soon as you can. If you only see one pylon in his base with your probe scout then that's enough. You'll need to deviate your build completely and go purely defensive. The first chronodstalker should be sent to look for the proxy. If you find it early enough you can actually depower the stargate before the oracle gets out. The next thing you need is astargate right when you have 150 gasafter the stalker. You can then get warp get and a 2nd stalker and chrono the 2nd stalker as well. You can decide to send the 2nd stalker to the proxy if you find it quick enough to try and keep it depowered or you can leave it home for extra defense if you don't feel like risking it. When the stargate is done you make a phoenix and chronoboost it and it will finish just as the oracle is coming into your base. If you depower the stargate then that's even better cause you can sometimes even fit in 2 phoenix before the oracle comes out. From there you can either do a 3gate phoenix all in to kill them, or just get 3 phoenix for harassment while getting a robo and expanding. If they go for blink after the oracle (which is pretty common) then you're going to want to do the 3 phoenix and robo response.

If you sniff out them doing a DT opener (1 gate, using all chrono, no signs of pressure at all, maybe find their probe trying to be sneaky and hide a pylon which will be a huge trigger since they opened so passively, see that a robo is finishing up as you start your pressure meaning he went DT/robo etc.) then you need tohide a robo on the map ASAPand also try to target their robo. If you notice it finishing as you start your pressure then you can kill it with the stalkers/DTs before an obs comes out. This is situational though as they may have sentries to FF it or have it tucked away where you can't reach it. If you can't kill the robo then just try to depower it or go straight for probes.

Pretty much any other opener and you'll be able to win with the aggression straight up.

This build opens with the fastest possible Dark Templar in order to keep your opponent pinned in their base as well as some light harass, while you safely transition into a 2 base economy and either a Robotics or Blink focused play.

Scouting

Being active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker back to the protection of your Mothership Core quickly if you have to defend an early attack. Hold on with Photon Overcharge until you can warp-in a DT to defend as well as harass.

This build is surprisingly safe against most openings, so scouting is pretty minimal.

Against standard Robo expand builds, your Nexus will be a little bit later.  You can make up for this either by using Warp Prism/DT harass or doing a Blink follow up to abuse their low production capability.

Against Blink play, simply take advantage of their lack of detection and kill a bunch of Probes. Against Dark Templar play, use your Observer and Stalker to push back their DTs while your(s) kill a bunch of Probes.

Against Stargate play, you might run into some problems. Phoenix will be able to scout what you are doing, and Oracles provide detection as well as harass potential.

Transitions

This build sets you up with a 2 base economy and both a Robotics Facility and Twilight Council. This lets you transition into either midgame Blink timings or Chargelot/Archon/Immortal macro play very easily.

To transition into Blink play, start and chronoboost Blink from your Twilight Council as soon as your first Dark Templar is warped in. Go up to 5 Gateways on 2 Assimilators and warp-in Blink Stalkers non-stop at your opponents base in order to punish typically greedy play in reaction to DT expand builds.

To transition into Chargelot/Archon/Immortal play, start Immortal production, a Forge, and go up to 3 Gateways. Once you are safely in the midgame, start Charge and be sure to out-expand your opponent.

Tips

- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial Stalker to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap?s 3gate All-in).
- You may want to proxy 2 Pylons with this build. One for the initial hidden Dark Shrine. The second for a close warp-in location for your initial DT.
- Un-chronoboosted Warpgate will time out perfectly with your Dark Shrine finishing
- Against Stargate play, be sure to position your initial units to defend your mineral line from potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.
- In the midgame, spend all of your Chronoboost on either the Robotics Facility or Twilight Council?depending on your transition.

Pros and Cons

This build is a reasonably safe build that allows you harass potential as well as forces your opponent to stay at home. It also expands at a normal time in order to get to the midgame quickly and transition smoothly into either a fast timing or macro play.

However, this build is somewhat weak against early Stargate play, for the Stargate allows for Oracles to both harass and detect and Phoenix to take map control.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Chronoboost,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,WarpgateUpgrade,MothershipCore,TwilightCouncil,Probe,Pylon,Probe,DarkShrine,Probe,Pylon,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Nexus,Probe,Observer,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,WarpInDarkTemplar', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:15 PM;

This aggressive build used by Liquid`TaeJa and many other top level Korean Terrans opens with a very standard Banshee build adapted to Heart of the Swarm and the cheaper Banshee Cloak upgrade. The Banshees are used to stay safe against early attacks as well as harass your opponent.

This build is VERY closely related to Polts Gas First Banshee Build  TaeJas version is just a Barracks first variant of Polts build.

Scouting

SCV scout after you start your 1st Refinery to check whether or not your opponent is opening with Reapers. Against an opponent opening Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground where your opponents Reaper(s) are most likely to hop up. Against a non-Reaper player, feel more safe; thus, you should try to deny your opponent vision of whether you have taken gasses in your main or expanded at your natural with your first few Marines.

Your next scout will come with your Banshee. With this Banshee, you can check what your opponents opener is. Against another Banshee player, follow-up your first Banshee with a Raven (and then potentially Viking if extra anti-air is needed). Against a Hellbat dropping player, make a few Widow Mines to burrow defensively against any incoming drop, as you use several Banshees to out-harass him. Against a player going for a Widow Mine Drop, position your Marines defensively at home and be sure to have enough scans to deal with his Widow Mines. Building a Raven might be useful, but not until after you have 2 Banshees with which to harass your opponent.

Finally, be sure to keep an eye out on what midgame transition your opponent is doing. Look for multiple Factories (signalling Mech play) or a researching Barracks Tech lab (signalling Bio play). Also be sure to keep tabs on your opponents base count: if he has not started a natural expansion before your Banshee has finished its harass, start Siege Tanks of your own as soon as possible to defend a 1 base all-in incoming your way.

Transitions

Because this build opens with every tech building, this build transitions quite strongly into either all-in, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play quite easily.

For an all-in transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory and start Siege Tank production instantly. When you hit 2 or 3 Siege Tanks, grab all of your Marines (>20), your Banshees/Vikings, and attempt to break your opponents front with a slow siege push.

It is possible to go into Marine/Tank or Mech after a 3 Command Center follow-up if you are sure your opponent will not be going for any more early game pressure. Start a Raven in order to save enough minerals to afford 2 Command Centers and then transition into either Marine/Tank or Mech just as below.

When transitioning into macro Marine/Tank play be sure to start your Siege Tank production after you start a 2nd Command Center. That way you have enough defense early and later can have a strong army going into the midgame. When you can afford it, start 2 more Barracks with Tech labs for Stimpack and Combat Shields and an Engineering Bay to start your Infantry upgrades. If you see your opponent playing Mech, then you can go for either a Marauder/Tank build like Polt is famous for or going for a pure Bio play style with 8+ Barracks pumping out as many Marauders as you can afford.

When transitioning into Mech play, the most standard follow-up is starting your Siege Tank count while you take a quick in-base 3rd Command Center. Then, starting 2 Factories and an Armory to start your Mech upgrades will take you into the mid game. Be sure to take all your Refineries before you need the gas, and try to safely secure your 3rd base with a healthy Siege Tank count in order to mine from the 6 gas geysers you need to fund a strong Mech army.

Tips

- If you scout your opponent going for early Reapers, be sure to position your Marines on the high ground above a hop-up ledge that your opponent is most likely going to use.
- Watch for any burrowed Widow Mines your opponent might be using defensively to stop your Banshee as you enter your opponents base.  Cloak your Banshee as soon as you see any potential for burrowed Widow Mines.
- Use your Banshee to pick off any enemy SCVs that are undefended by a Turret.  If you are transitioning to a 1/1/1 all-in, then be sure to target-fire Marines as well.
- Always favor keeping your Banshee(s) alive over doing a little bit more damage. The promise of continued harass is a lot more useful than an extra SCV kill or two. You can also repair a weakened Banshee at home with SCVs if you can keep it alive.
- If during your harass you scout your opponent going for a 1 base all-in, then start Siege Tank production as soon as possible in order to hold your natural. You can also use your Banshee(s) to delay the attack for quite some time unless your opponent created a Raven.
- Do NOT produce more than 4 Banshees. Each Banshee you produce takes a considerable amount of gas that could otherwise be spent on beefing up your midgame army such as by getting Stimpack, Siege Tanks, or upgrades.

Pros and Cons

This build is a standard, aggressive opener in TvT that both scouts and stays safe in the early game. Also, this build is quite versatile when it comes to transitions, for you are able to transition into an all-in, 3 Command Center play, macro Marine/Tank, or macro Mech play. Also, this build requires a lot less APM than other TvT builds, so it can be very useful for lower league players.

However, this build is not quite as effective at killing workers as a Widow Mine Drop into Banshee build. Also, this build sacrifices upgrades in favor of tech, as you will often be behind your opponent in the Stimpack research or Engibay/Armory upgrades, especially if they open with a fast expansion. Finally, if your opponent defends this build with a 1rax FE without taking any damage, then you will have a tough time trying to deal with midgame bio timings and drops unless you position your Siege Tanks quite defensively.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Barracks,SCV,Refinery,SCV,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Marine,OrbitalCommand,SupplyDepot,Marine,Factory,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Refinery,SCV,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,Starport,ReactorOnBarracks,TechLabOnFactory,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,CallMule,SCV,LandStarportOnTechLab,CloakingField,DoubleMarines,Banshee,SCV,DoubleMarines,SCV', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:16 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'TLO 2 Base Muta', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This build opens with an economic 2 base Muta opener, and uses a 7:20 Overlord scout coupled with the initial Mutalisk harass to determine whether your Terran opponent is using a Bio-based composition, or a Mech-based composition.

Scouting

Scout first with your 2 initial Zerglings, use them to take the Xel?Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of the Terran?s base depending on the map. If you see Terran move out with some kind of force very early, you will probably need emergency Spine Crawlers ? your Metabolic Boost will only be finishing around 8:20!
Your next scout will be with an Overlord as soon as your Lair finishes (around 7:05).  With this scout, aim to check if your opponent is playing Mech or Bio. Seeing any of the following can indicate Mech play: an Armory, more than 1 Factory, a Factory with Tech Lab, a lack of Barracks, or a lack of add-ons on Barracks. Seeing any of the following can indicate Bio play: 2 Engineering Bays, a Barracks with a researching Tech lab, more than 1 Barracks, or only one Factory.  If you scout Bio, you can still continue with a 2 base Spire timing and transition into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk OR you can abort the 2 base Spire timing and throw down 2 Evolution Chambers as soon as possible for +1/+1 Melee/Carapace upgrades.
The next scout will be with your initial Mutalisks. Terran will be forced to defend himself with his units, so you?ll see either Bio or Mech units to defend. These Mutalisks should be able to get into his main quite easily and scout what type of production he is using, perhaps even doing some economic damage.

Transitions

If you confirm Mech play with your Mutalisks, throw down an Infestation Pit. If you are sure he is going Mech before your Mutalisks arrive, then you can even place the Infestation Pit as soon as your Mutalisks hatch. Add more bases and Swarm Hosts when you can afford them.  Swarm Hosts are a strong option as your initial Mutalisks will likely force Turrets, Thors, and Widow Mines?units that are generally not strong against Swarm Host play. Alternatively, you can go into Overlord Speed and drop-play, to abuse the lack of Terran mobility. Finally, you can also place your Hive as soon as possible and go for a follow-up Brood Lord transition.
If you confirm Bio play with your Mutalisks, throw down 2 Evolution Chambers and a Baneling Nest as soon as possible. Note that you will be behind in upgrades against a 3 base macro Terran player, but you can recuperate this loss by aiming to snipe a key Tech lab researching Stimpack or Combat Shields, as this can prevent Terran from being aggressive with his upgrade lead. Good creep spread and strong engagements/burrowed Banelings can also mitigate this upgrade deficit. Once you hit the lategame, you have the option to transition into your preferred Hive tech.

Tips

- If you place a 5:00-5:30 Spine Crawler, you should be able to stop Hellions made from a Factory started before your opponent?s 2nd base. A 6:00-6:30 Spine Crawler will finish in time to stop Hellions made after your opponent?s 2nd base or Hellions made after a Reaper opener.
- Just when your Lair finishes (7:20ish), ideally you should be fully saturated on your 2 bases with extra minerals going into additional Drones. However, there are a couple of defensive options available if you are under pressure: If you have extra Drones and want to completely deter Hellion runbys, then make a wall-off with 2 Evolution Chambers and your Spine Crawler at the front of your natural.This will not slow down your Mutalisk timing as long as you remain fully saturated on all mineral lines and Extractors. Alternatively, you also have the ability to make a large group of Zerglings (only if you need to defend yourself) without hurting the timing of the Mutalisks. Note that you should only do this if you absolutely have to because droning should always be a priority. Remember that Metabolic Boost will only finish around 8:20, so any Zerglings made before this point should be used strictly for defense.

Pros and Cons

This build is incredibly strong against Mech players. The initial Mutalisks will force extra Missile Turrets, Thors, and Widow Mines ? units that are all not ideal against the large mass of Swarm Hosts that you should follow-up with.
If you scout your opponent opening Bio with your Mutalisk timing, then you can transition into Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk. The obvious problem here is that you will be behind on upgrades, but again this is not game-ending provided you get strong, cost-efficient engagements on creep. Also, this build is vulnerable to large Marine attacks in the early-game because you will not have Metabolic Boost yet to defend them. Hopefully, however, you can scout this coming with your initial Zerglings and/or Overlord in order to stay safe with Spine Crawlers.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Queen,Queen,Zergling,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Queen,Overlord,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,SpawnCreepTumor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Lair,Extractor,Extractor,Extractor,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,MetabolicBoost,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Spire,Overlord,Overlord,Hatchery,Queen,Overlord,Overlord,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,Overlord,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,SpawnCreepTumor,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,SpawnCreepTumor,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk,Mutalisk', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:16 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Taeja Autoturret Doom Drop', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

Though it has fallen out of popularity, this once dominant build still remains as powerful as ever. Utilizing a gas first opening to stay safe against an opponents gas first aggression, this build gets a fast two Medivacs to violently drop 8 Marines, 2 Siege Tanks, and 3 Auto Turrets in a critical position of the enemys base.

Scouting

Taeja chooses only to scout with his Hellion, preserving all his SCVs for maximum income. At times, he cannot afford continuous Marine or SCV production in the demonstration replay; had he SCV scouted he would be even more pushed for minerals.

SCV scouting is definitely an option if you do not feel safe enough with the delayed hellion scout, but it should be relegated to a 4:30 scout at the very earliest so as to not delay your Starport in any way.

Transitions

This build can transition into both Bio or Mech. Because you have made no major investments down either tech path, and you have exactly one of each necessary production structure, you can literally go into whatever style you want.

Tips

Against a live resisting opponent, execution of this build may run into some problems. They could be opening banshees; forcing Turrets to be made just before you move out. They could be doing the exact same build, resulting in a base trade. They could be doing earlier aggression that pins you in your base for longer than youd like, such as an elevator attack or a doom drop.

There are reactions to each of these plays, and there are far too many to list here. Regardless of what happens though, sometimes it is important to identify that you are more ahead simply by staying home and defending, and not to blindly commit to the attack every single game. This will come by experience and repeatedly executing the build.

Three main consistencies must be maintained;

1) You MUST continue unit production behind this attack; you cannot start a big transition (adding on Barracks/Factories while freezing production by constructing addons) else you will be extremely vulnerable to a counter attack. The only exception is when you know with certainty that your opponent will not be performing some sort of counterattack (for example, he has gone 3 Barracks into delayed Factory, or he has gone for a elevator and youve already killed the medivacs beforehand).

2) Once your autoturrets are dropped, its almost always a good idea to fly the Raven home; it will prove useful in the mid game.

3) If they made Banshees, you have to make turrets before moving out, else risk losing the game. Delay this to the last possible moment, as you are already pressed for cash.

Pros and Cons

The lethality of this build cannot be understated; you can simply win most games with this drop, especially against players who have gone for more macro oriented builds, such as a Reaper FE or a 15 gas style.

Unfortunately, if your opponent identifies your build quickly enough and prepositions his units properly, or employs defensive AOE such as Tanks or Widow Mines, your drop may end up doing little to no damage, and you can easily die to a counter push or drop.', @Race = 'Terran', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,SCV,SCV,SCV,SCV,SupplyDepot,SCV,SCV,Refinery,SCV,Barracks,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,SCV,SCV,SCV,Factory,OrbitalCommand,Marine,SupplyDepot,Marine,SCV,CallMule,SCV,Marine,Starport,Refinery,SCV,TechLabOnFactory,Marine,SupplyDepot,SCV,GasScv,GasScv,GasScv,LiftFactoryFromTechLab,Hellion,SCV,LandStarportOnTechLab,Raven,SupplyDepot,SCV,CallMule,ReactorOnBarracks,SCV,SCV,CommandCenter,SCV,LiftStarportFromTechLab,LandFactoryOnTechLab,SiegeTank,DoubleMarines,SCV,SupplyDepot,Medivac,CallMule,SCV,DoubleMarines,SupplyDepot,SiegeTank,SCV,SCV,DoubleMarines,Medivac,SCV,OrbitalCommand', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:16 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Terminator Oracle into SkyToss', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'It's a very simple opening. You do a normal gate FE and then get 2 gates and a sentry to keep safe vs anything they could possibly throw at you early and then get the stargate with the next 150 gas and make an oracle out of it for any initial drone damage as well as scouting. It isEXTREMELY important you DO NOT lose the oracle. It is more of ascouting unitthan it is a harassing unit in this build. You aren't getting a robo for observers and you aren't getting a high sentry count for hallucinations so the oracle is your only means of map control. If you wanna try being risky with the oracle to snag a few drone kills here or there that you think you might not get away with, then decide against it and keep the oracle alive instead.

After the oracle you go intonon stop void ray production.

Mid game transition/Reations

From the 3rd base you get 2 more stargates and +1 Air to round out your mass void rays. There are a couple things the zerg might do that would require you to do a different response than non stop void ray until like the 20th minute.

Hydra/Ling Pushes

So this is what I think is the most difficult to stop with this exact build. Since it focuses so much on void rays and so little on gateway units it seems it would be a bit awkward to hold hydra/ling. This is why the oracle is so important because you need to identify this is happening as soon as possible. You'll need more zealots and 1 or 2 more sentries. Keep making void rays as much as you can. You might need to only do 1 extra stargate instead of 2 to be able to keep your gateway production up. You can also get extra cannons by your 3rd to help defend. What you want to be doing is segmenting his army up in tiny tiny bite size chunks. Keep as much of his hydra army away from you as possible. Just stall and delay as much as possible until you get a decent void ray/gateway count up and just splitting off chunks of his army. It's a very fragile and patient game that you must play. From there it's best to go into twilight council and storm/charge earlier if he continues to mass hydra. If he goes swarm host after then you can keep going SkyToss.

Burrowed Roaches

This is a style some zergs like to use vs fast 3rds off of a stargate. Since your units are so slow and you don't have as many of them (compared to +2/blink openers) he just masses roaches and burrows them all over your 3 bases and widdles you down. If you notice he's doing this then you're going to needextra cannons in each baseto cover important areas. You should alsobring your oracle home for revelationsince you won't have an observer. Basically if you see it early enough you should be fine since you can spam cannons and void rays.

Roach/Hydra/Viper

This also elicits the faster twilight response. If you notice him rushing to hive after a passive roach hydra opener (or any roach hydra opener really) thenyou NEED HT's to feedback the vipers. If they do the really fast version of this then you won't be at your critical mass of void rays yet and he'll be able to pull them all out of position over top his army. So you just need to transition into charge/HT faster.

Mutas

Simple enough. Scout that he's going spire and make phoenix instead of void rays.

Late Game

So if he's just being passive and letting you do whatever you want (aka making only void rays) be it with either swarm hosts or whatever, then you want to be going around the map with void ray hit squads to try and snipe hatcheries. This is what Protoss used to do back in 2013 when void ray/HT was popular. You go out with your voids and MSCore and try to snipe hatches since they DPS them down so quickly, and then recall back.

If he's being passive you eventually want to still go into twilight for DT harass and storm. If you want to go ahead and mass carriers then by all means go ahead and mass carriers. If you wanna be a little safer and more traditional, then go for faster storm. Just defend, defend, defend and react to any tech switches from zerg and then take the golden fight when you find it. It's a relatively simple game plan, but still fragile if caught out before you get the carriers out. Since you have such a high void ray count though (like 20) then it should deter the zerg from trying to actually engage you.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,GoOutProbe,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,Nexus,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Pylon,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Sentry,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Probe,Stargate,Probe,Probe,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Oracle,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Forge,Probe,Probe,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Pylon,VoidRay,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,GroundWeaponsLevel1,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,WarpInSentry,Probe,Probe,Nexus,VoidRay,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,WarpInSentry,WarpInSentry,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,VoidRay,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Stargate,Stargate', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:16 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Trap 5 Stalker rush 3 gate', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'This is a really cool flexible and versatile build. You can use it in many situations and have a good response for pretty much anything they could do. As evidence to that point, Trap used this exact same build 4 times in a row vs sOs at Redbull DC and won every time with it.

So the idea behind the build is that you do a 5 stalker rush early on to get maximum map control and pressure potential. After scouting basically everything on your side of the map you turn that control into aggression with a follow up 3 gate attack that hits quite early (~6:40) with an uncommon 8 stalkers. It' packs a much more powerful punch even though it hits slightly later than traditional 3gates due to the fact that it hits with so many stalkers. Most of the times when you go against an early expand build with a 3stalker rush 3gate you'll need the aid of an oracle to really close the deal since they'll be able to get immortals out. However since this hits so powerfully you can get a cancel on the nexus or even end the game. A very cool thing Trap did in game 1 vs sOs on King Sejong is that he went up the ramp with the first 3 stalkers to bait an overcharge from sOs in the main after seeing it was a fast expand. This allowed him free reign over the natural so he could easily kill it. It may not always be that easy but the potential is there.

If they go blink themselves then the hope is that you hit with so many stalkers so early that you can overwhelm them before they can get blink done. However if this isn't possible you should back off and try to expand earlier so you don't die when his blink is done. If they go blink/obs then you should be safe to expand since they won't be able to commit as hard, however if they go 4gate blink you can make a dark shrine instead of blink to kill them. Going for robo after such a late blink like this is risky as you have a huge window to die to a player who just masses only stalkers.

If they go stargate then you should kind of just win. Again, the initial 8 stalkers packs a powerful punch and if you can't end them early then the follow up blink will be a good plan B. Whether it be just to defend a 2nd base easier or to do a follow up all in with blink and 4gates.

If they go DTs you'll need to be able to sniff the build out. If you get a feeling that they might go DTs early then you can get a robo behind the 3gates instead of the twilight council to be safe. Or if you can poke early enough with your first 3 stalkers to get a second look to see if they're going DTs then you can cancel the twilight, make a robo and then warp in sentries at home to block the ramp. You might need to bring your 4th and 5th stalker back to hold position on the ramp as well to buy more time.

If they go for a very fast robo after an expansion you can also proxy a stargate (or just make one in base) after the twilight finishes (don't research blink) or after canceling the twilight. It's a similar response to how you deal with fast expands with thesOs build I did last PvP.Trap nearly kills sOs with the initial 3gate, however gets the stargate anyway which ends up finishing the deal. So even though it's quite late it still does the job well.

Now the other cool thing with this build is that it has a fast expand variant. The build ends up lining up to be very similar to thesafe 2 gate expandthat I covered. The only difference is the double chronod stalkers and that the sentries come last and there's only 2 of them. The nexus and robo go down at identical times. So if you want you can easily learn this build and it'll be perfect in a best of series since you can open with either the aggressive option or defensive option and then switch it around the 2nd game to trick your opponent since it looks identical to them.

This build is cool because it starts out with the most standard all around robo opening possible. So not only is it safe vs basically any opener the Terran can do,it looks totally standardand adds an extra bit of mind games on top of the fake all in. The 2 stalkers will keep you safe vs any sort of early pokes and if you see them doing a gas first opener then you just follow up with your normal response with the robo for observers and what not. I prefer following up with a DT drop after gas first openers, but you can still try to do the build after you defend as well.

The build skips gateways for a while so if he's doing any sort of really crazy aggressive push then you're banking on the immortals and overcharge to keep you alive.Don't be afraid to show the immortalsif you really need them to defend early on, because this build is all about mind games early on so them seeing the immortals is honestly not even that big of a deal because it can force them to go super defensive even earlier than normal which will only benefit you.

The fake attack + Mid game transition

So once warp gate is done you're gonna be warping in only sentries. Trap goes up to 5 which is a good amount where if the Terran sees that many they'll still think you're all inning but not so much that it hinders any chance of transition.

Now one more thing I should note about the push is that there is a vulnerability to 3 rax openings. Since your gate count comes in so late, if you move out on the map with only the first few units and they opened 3 rax then you're probably gonna get caught out and lose. So if you notice they open 3 rax while doing this build, juststart your move out after you warp in the sentries at homeinstead of going across right away. You might even need to defend with the immortals before you can attack if they go soon enough.

The transition is quite simple to pull off if you scare the terran. You get charge and the templar archives right when the twilight council is done andyou also continue making probes the entire timeyou were doing the fake attack. So by the time you're transitioning you'll be fully saturated. The transition is very easily defended because even if the terran doesn't fully buy into your fake attack, if they still try to attack themselves after then the 5 gates worth of units and 2 immortals you made is SO helpful in defending. 5 sentries do wonders to split up small amounts of bio and you should be just fine against any kind of counter pressure if they do it at all. You also get a warp prism after the observer so that if they do try to counter attack then you have a nice 4 zealot drop going on in their main at the same time.

From there just chrono the storm and try your best to keep it a secret. Storm is always great if they don't know about it for as long as possible. You can then come out of no where with 5+ HT's full of energy with them having no idea about it and you just get a free win.

Late game

If you don't get the eZ free win then you can just continue on like with any normal PvT opening. You can make a quick tech over to colossus since he will have identified the HT's late.

This is a fun build. Not many people are expecting DT drops anymore so they can do quite the damage to unprepared Terrans and lead you into a nice mid game with the colossus to defend and the warp prism to continue harassment for basically the whole game if you can keep it alive.

The opening is like a normal twilight opening with a 28 TC off of a normal 1 gate FE. There's a proxy pylon after the 2nd stalker to hide the dark shrine to make it easier to surprise the terran. If they get a reaper in or scan you can easily throw a chrono down on the TC to fake going blink. If you want you can warp the first DT in from your proxy pylon and send it across the map and then when your warp prism gets to their base the 2nd warp in will be ready, or you can just do it with the warp prism half way to his base and load it up and once more when you get there, either way it doesn't really matter.

The build also gets an early sentry after 2 stalkers to help defend vs any 3 rax aggression. In the sample video Trap uses a forcefield on the ramp to keep him from going up into the main and keeping him down by the overcharge. Even though he loses like 12 probes, the 3 rax commitment is so strong that your DT's will be able to do equal if not more damage than the 3 rax. This is especially true since they won't have turrets up since they have to delay their ebay for a long time when doing a 3rax. Their SCV count will also be low from the start. So even if you can't defend perfectly at your natural, make sure you can do a lot of damage with the DTs. Keep them alive as long as possible by picking them up out of scans with the warp prism etc.

Trap does a pretty greedy follow up after the DT opening. He goes into 2 forges instead of 2 gateways and gets a later robo bay as well. This is because he knows his DTs will be keeping Reality back so he can tech up like that, however if you want to play it safer then the follow up I provided will be much better for you. It gets the 2 extra gates at 8 minutes as well as the robo bay. A single forge comes slightly earlier. If you notice the terran went for earlier ebays then you can go for double forge. Play as greedy as you would like to.

From there you just make more gates around 9-10 minutes in anticipation for their mid game medivac pressure and take a 3rd base whenever you feel safe with blink and colossus while denying/harassing their 3rd with the warp prism.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Terran', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,GoOutProbe,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Nexus,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Assimilator,Pylon,Probe,Stalker,WarpgateUpgrade,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,TwilightCouncil,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,DarkShrine,Probe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Chronoboost,RoboticsFacility,Probe,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Sentry,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,WarpPrism,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,WarpInDarkTemplar,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,RoboticsBay,Probe,Probe,WarpInDarkTemplar,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Forge,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Probe,Colossus,ExtendedThermalLance,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,GroundArmorLevel1,Chronoboost,Chronoboost', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:16 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Trap 3gate All-in', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'General Overview

This hyper-aggressive 3gate all-in opens with a Gateway on 10 supply in order to get the fastest Warpgate Research possible. It then hits a ridiculously early (@5:30ish) 3gate attack in order to end the game before leaving the early game.

Scouting

This build requires very minimal scouting, for you are placing your initial Gateway at 10 supply?long before any scouting information could influence your build. However, it is critical to send a Probe out to set up proxy Pylon(s) BEFORE your Warpgate is done. Thus, probe scouting to check whether your opponent has opened with a 3 Stalker Rush in order to deny proxy Pylons can yield useful information.

Transitions

This build is an all-in in every respect: getting a 10 Gateway, non-stop chronoboosting Warpgate, halting Probe production at 16 (on minerals), and dumping all money into Gateway units. Thus, there is no well-defined transition. If you are late in your execution and do not outright kill your opponent (or at least take out their army and 10+ Probes), then you will most likely lose the game to any sort of Robotics/Twilight/Stargate counter-attack.

Tips

- Use only 1 Chronoboost on Probes (as you resume Probe production after your 10 Gateway).
- Use 1 Chronoboost on your Zealot in order to finish it as your Cybernetics Core finishes.
- ALL THE REST OF YOUR CHRONOBOOST MUST BE DUMPED INTO WARPGATE RESEARCH. The limiting factor on this build is how fast you can finish Warpgate. Be sure to non-stop chronoboost your Cybernetics Core until it finishes researching so as to attack as early as possible.
- There is a slightly more aggressive/less economic version of this build that opens with a 15 Zealot, 17 Pylon, and never chronoboosts the Zealot. That build and this build can be used interchangeably based on personal preference.
- Place your proxy Pylons quite aggressively for your attack to hit as fast as possible, unless you need to hide your proxy Pylon from a 3 Stalker rushing player.
- Commit to the attack as quickly as possible and never stop warping-in Zealots and Stalkers until either you have won the game or you have lost all of your units. The strength of this all-in is how quickly and ferociously it attacks, but if you are not constantly attacking then your opponent?s economic/tech advantage can destroy you.

Pros and Cons

This build is a hyper-aggressive all-in that is able to get 5 Stalkers and 1 Zealot warped-in at your opponent?s base at 5:30. Because of how quickly this build attacks, it can punish most greedy PvP builds with ease.
Unfortunately, this all-in is quite easy to scout because you cannot hide the fact that you are getting your first Gateway and Cybernetics Core much earlier than the normal timing. However, it being easy to scout and easy to defend are two fundamentally different things, so you can still win with this build quite often.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Pylon,Zealot,Chronoboost,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Stalker,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Stalker,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:16 PM;

This build opens with a Forge Fast Expand and then utilizes everything the Twilight Council has to offer in order to all-in your opponent. This two base all-in gets +2 attack, DTs, and mass Blink Stalkers to crush your opponent before the late game.

Scouting

After any early game shenanigans are ruled out, as you have spotted your opponent s third Hatchery going down, then there is no need for any scouting besides what you see with your two pokes.

When you move out with your first 3 units (Zealot, Stalker, and Mothership Core), go to Zerg s third base and see if you can pick off a queen and force some units. If your opponent reveals that he has Roaches already, then instantly pull back and stay behind your wall until your next poke with the DTs.  Expect a Roach defense vs your Blink Stalkers. If your opponent only shows slow Zerglings, then know that your opponent delayed gas and most likely has a larger economy than normal. Expect a lot more units vs your Blink Stalkers. If your opponent shows Speedlings, then pull back and stay behind your wall until your next poke with the DTs. Expect a Roach/Ling or Hydra/Ling defense vs your Blink Stalkers.

When you send your DTs to each base of your opponent, be on the look out for what units he has to defend, or what tech structures he has built. Your push is just about to happen, so it is too late to react in any way, but it is nice to know what units you will be up against before you are actually fighting them head on.

Transitions

This build is an all-in, so there is no true transition out of it. Simply keep reinforcing with your +2 Blink Stalkers (chronoboost your Gateways when you can) until your opponent is forced to leave or your army gets crushed.

If you do not win, but see that your opponent has way too much Roach or Hydra or Roach/Hydra for you to defeat, consider falling back onto a 3rd Nexus, and starting double Robotics Colossi production as a desperation move.

Tips

- Spend all of your early game chronoboost on your Nexii to maximize Probe production.
- Because you are getting your +1 Attack so early, there is no need to chronoboost it very often. Prioritize Probes instead.
- Do not over commit with your first three units. The Zealot can be killed, but if at all possible, retreat with your Stalker and Mothership Core still alive.
- Hide the Twilight Council (and later Dark Shrine) somewhere in your base that is less likely to be scouted by an Overlord.
- Keep a Probe hidden somewhere on the map before you are ready to move out. Being able to place a nice proxy Pylon for the DTs and then later Stalker warp-ins can be the difference between an easy win and a tough loss.
- Obviously, during the fight itself, utilize Blink to save the weakest Stalkers and keep your army alive.

Pros and Cons

This build is a solid all-in that utilizes everything the Twilight Council has to offer. It is a 1-2-3 punch sort of build, first hitting with your initial 3 units, then the DTs, and then the Blink Stalkers, so it keeps Zergs on their toes.

However, because this build is so reliant on the Twilight Council, your opponent flying in an overlord and spotting this will tip them off to everything that you are building; it is very easy to scout (Note: just because it is easy to scout does NOT mean it is easy to defend). Also, it is an all-in, so assuming you do not succeed in crushing your opponent with the Blink Stalkers, there is very little chance you have of coming back into the game. Finally, because this build packs a 1-2-3 punch, it is a more mechanically difficult build than other choices and is not suggested for newer players.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,GoOutProbe,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Nexus,Forge,Pylon,Probe,Gateway,Probe,Chronoboost,PhotonCanon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Probe,GroundWeaponsLevel1,Zealot,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,WarpgateUpgrade,MothershipCore,Probe,Chronoboost,Stalker,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,TwilightCouncil,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,Probe,Blink,DarkShrine,Pylon,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Probe,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,GroundWeaponsLevel2,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Gateway,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInDarkTemplar,WarpInDarkTemplar,WarpInDarkTemplar,Pylon,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,WarpInStalker,Pylon', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:17 PM;

This build uses a fast +1 Carapace upgrade to secure a fast 3rd Base and deny opposing 3rds before it transitions into a swift +1/+1 Speed Roach timing and eventual +2/+1.

Scouting

In the early stages of the game, all scouting comes from Overlord vision, so be sure that you send your initial 2 Overlords towards your opponent?s natural expansion. You can use your Overlord to compare his Hatchery?s HP to yours, to determine what kind of opener he used. If his hatchery is stronger than yours, he has gone hatchery first. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is the same HP as yours, he has VERY LIKELY done the same build as you. Continue as normal. If his hatchery is weaker to yours, he has gone for a gas and pool before hatchery in some order, meaning his speed is quicker than yours. Banelings before speed in this scenario is often advised, and likely make the Baneling nest in the main to not lose your Baneling tech to mass Zerglings with speed. An alternative is to not use your Gas, and get extra Queens and 2-3 Spine Crawlers. The main theme here is to not get Speed first, as his WILL be quicker. You need to find an edge that isn?t using Zergling Speed.
When playing versus any very early aggression (<10 pool), use your Drones to defend until you have your own Zerglings, a Queen, and potentially a Spine Crawler. Consider canceling the Hatchery for more minerals. Also use your initial overlord to scout when your opponent is taking their natural Hatchery. Feel free to apply some light pressure with your first Zerglings against a Hatch first build, but do not let it mess up your macro.
Make sure you have 2 to 4 Zerglings out on the map at all times. Send your initial 2 Zerglings to your opponent?s base to spot what they have at the front, and if possible get into the main with 1 Ling to see whether your hatching Drones or Zerglings from their eggs. Use the scouting intel that these pokes give you to determine whether you should get Banelings and extra Zerglings to defend yourself or pressure your opponent, or whether you should continue droning.
If your scout Zerglings see Drones hatching, and no wall at the front, you can choose to make Drones OR Zerglings to pressure. If you scout Zerglings, and no wall at the front, you should make the same amount of Zerglings. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings escape, send them back in to scout in 20~ seconds. If you scout nothing hatching, and your Zerglings die, remake the scout. Consider another 2 Zerglings for just-in-case Banelings. If you scout a wall, the Zerg is likely playing passive and you are likely safe.
As soon as you are sure you are safe, transition into your choice of tech.

Transitions

This has best synergy with a Hydralisk transition, which is possible after taking gas numbers 5 and 6 at your third base, although you could flood earlier Speedlings with +1 Carapace. However, you have the option of simply researching +1 Melee upgrades to transition into upgraded Speedlings, which is excellent against Mutalisk openers, or even going for a delayed Spire.

Tips

If your opponent is also going for a Roach based composition, remember that Roach Battles are mostly determined by macro and concaves. The superior concave will allow a smaller force to defeat a larger one, for the most part ? this is because more Roaches can fight in a larger concave, although you can also rush forward to allow the ones in the back to attack.
Against a Mutalisk based player, be sure to scout to see how many Mutalisks your opponent is making. If he is only making a few Mutalisks to dictate the pace of the game and force spores, you will probably be able to get away with only making Queens and Spores. If your opponent is heavily committing to Mutalisks, then consider incorporating Hydralisks and Infestors earlier than you normally would, in addition to the standard Queens and Spores. Spore Crawlers should also be placed to cover your Extractors, to ensure you do not fall behind tech wise. Do not be afraid to delay your Roach Timing if you are not sure how your opponent is going to play it out.
Against an upgraded Speedling force, delay your timing until you are maxed out. If your opponent invests very heavily into melee and carapace upgrades, they are almost certainly transitioning into an Ultralisk focused composition.

Pros and Cons

This build is a very flexible opener, which can combat greedier defensive play and also more aggressive play if your defensive micro is strong.
Because you are opening +1 Carapace Speedlings, taking and defending your third should relatively straightforward. Additionally, you have the opportunity of being reactive; the infrastructure you have at Lair level (+1 Carapace, Roach Warren, Metabolic Boost) allow you to choose between +1/+1 Speedlings, +1+1 Roaches, or even a slightly delayed Mutalisk transition.
However, this build by default will skip the Baneling nest in favor of faster upgrades and Lair Tech, so it is important to be on point with your scouting to avoid dying to enemy Baneling/Speedling aggression. If your scouting is poor, consider opening instead with the Safe Ling/Bling Opener, which will teach you what to look for and give you the tools to defend with.', @Race = 'Zerg', @VsRace = 'Zerg', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,SpawningPool,Drone,Drone,Hatchery,Overlord,Extractor,Drone,Queen,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Queen,Drone,MetabolicBoost,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,EvolutionChamber,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GroundCarapaceLevel1,Hatchery,Drone,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Lair,InjectLarva,RoachWarren,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Extractor,Extractor,Extractor,InjectLarva,Zergling,Zergling,Zergling,InjectLarva,Overlord,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,GasDrone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,Overlord,Drone,Drone,InjectLarva,InjectLarva,Drone,Drone,Drone,Drone,GlialReconstitution,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Overlord,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,Roach,InjectLarva,InjectLarva', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:17 PM;

Reactions to certain builds

Early gateway attacks

Unlike the phoenix opener, this one deals with gateway timings much easier. The oracle can do more than the phoenix in terms of back stabbing. It really puts the other player on a timer with their attack if you can get good damage done with the oracle. And with 2 extra gates coming in instead of a robo and 1 gate you will be able to defend much easier. In combination with the oracle doing damage you'll only really need to stop 1 or 2 waves of units and you'll be good. Overcharge will help delay and buy time as well.

Stargate openers

This requires some alteration on your part. You can't really go for the original build if you scout them going for stargate. You'll have to either cancel and go for faster blink or go into phoenix like the other build. Your oracle won't be able to do much at all if they go stargate. I prefer going phoenix instead of canceling because if they go oracle then you will shut that down 100% and if they don't then you can do a 3gate phoenix all in and just poop all over them because they don't expect you to all in with phoenix. So I'd suggest reading the sOs phoenix opener as well to help with this area of this build.

DTs

If you sniff out a potential DT opener (no gateway units + no chronoboost + all pylons in base or just seeing the twilight council very early) then you just keep the oracle home and wait for them. If after a while they never come then send it across and just play defensive and macro up and use blink to pressure.

Robo Expand

In this scenario you'll be able to use the oracle for full map control and harassment similar to the phoenix opener. The addition to this build is that you'll have blink to do some light pressure at the front as well. The nexus will be a bit later but you should be able to even the worker count with the oracle and blink. Just be sure not to go overboard with stalkers (just 4-6 is fine) otherwise you'll end up behind and you probably won't be able to break him.

Another thing you can do if you see that it's a robo expand early on, is to just do a 3gate oracle all in skipping twilight. This is a blind counter to robo expands but you'll need to see it early enough and choose your reaction immediately.

Blink

This is the builds biggest weakness. If they go for a straight 3/4gate blink all in then you're basically dead. Not every PvP build is perfect with a reaction to everything. If this happens then there's very little you can do since their blink will be much faster and they will have invested more into stalkers earlier than you. The best you can do is hope your oracle stays alive and to kill enough probes after they move out so that you can slowly edge ahead while you wait for your own blink to finish.

Transition to mid game

Again this is very similar to the sOs phoenix opener. Just get your nexus and a robo/forge to macro up into a normal PvP mid game. Use the oracle and blink to provide light pressure wherever you can fit it.

Something you can do if you see them being greedy is to do a 2 base blink all in. The linked VOD below has Trap doing it vs Has. Since Has got a very late robo, Trap was able to abuse that with a huge late stalker flood and eventually overwhelm Has.', @Race = 'Protoss', @VsRace = 'Protoss', @BuildItems = 'DefaultItem,Probe,Probe,Probe,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Gateway,Probe,Probe,Assimilator,Assimilator,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Pylon,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,GasProbe,Probe,CyberneticsCore,Probe,Probe,Chronoboost,Probe,Probe,Stargate,WarpgateUpgrade,MothershipCore,Chronoboost,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Oracle,Stalker,Gateway,Gateway,Probe,Pylon,Probe,TwilightCouncil,Probe,Stalker,Pylon,Probe,Probe,Blink,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,Chronoboost,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,SwitchToWarpgate,Probe,Probe,Nexus', @OwnerUserID = 8, @AddedDate = 10/9/2015 3:28:17 PM;

EXEC dbo.BuildOrders_Insert @Name = 'Zest 11gate stargate', @SC2VersionID = '2.2.0', @Description = 'Build lines up VERY tightly. This build comes down to the gas count. You save up a lot of chrono early on to let the build flow and so that way you can chrono each phoenix as they start. By the time each chronod phoenix is finished you will have exactly 100 gas to start the next phoenix. After 4 chronod phoenix you will then have exactly 100 gas to start the robo and then 300 minerals left over for 2 gateways. If you do it perfectly, then you'll know when because it is very exact.

The idea is to get a RIDICULOUSLY fast stargate for phoenix to be able to scout exactly what your opponent is doing, and easily defend said thing that your opponent is doing. The build relies on the early phoenix and MSCore to keep you safe, however of course you'll need to do some adaptations to hold off certain styles. However the main premise behind the build is to set up a nice early game with easy scouting and an easy transition into the mid game with harass potential that normally would not be available.

Now this build is obviously a complete hard counter to normal stargate openers. Your stargate is much faster than theirs so you can easily prepare for an oracle and you will always be ahead in the phoenix count. This pretty much forces them to either do a all in with stargate tech that you can easily poop all over, or go into delayed blink. This is then easily prevented with a robo for immortals as shown in Zest's game vs Trap. If it's an all in, then collect your free win. If not then just proceed into a normal macro game.

If you play vs someone going straight to blink, then a very similar response will be made. Again, the advantage to this build is that you will 100% see what they are doing so you can have enough time to prepare. Upon seeing the fast twilight for blink, (make sure it is blink instead of DTs. This can be determined by the gate count, the stalker count (or lack there of) and other timings from the early build.) you will stop at 2 or 3 phoenix and instantly throw down your robo and extra gates. You'll have to stay on 1 base for some time since it you obviously can't expand vs a 1 base all in. However this response is extremely similar to how you would deal with blink using the old HerO phoenix opener from WoL. In HotS now, the difference is that you have an early MSCore for overcharge and you can transition into the power house immortal/void ray composition that MC has shown to be quite effective.

Vs. DT's it's pretty obvious. You scout it early (because you can) and then make an oracle or very fast robo for detection and continue to expand like normal.

Vs. greedier expands you just take advantage of your early phoenix to harass him while getting your own expansion up and getting even through your phoenix harassment.

The hard part comes with 3gates/4gates and the like. Now I'm not 100% sure of how to deal with this perfectly yet, however the best idea I (and FlatLine) could come up with is relying on the early overcharge (the reason you get the fast MSCore) and phoenix to lift units within range of the overcharge.

This Reaper FE opens with a strong economy, and then transitions into constant harass with a Widow Mine drop follow-up.

Scouting

This build is reasonably safe against most your opponent can open with as long as you are smart with your two Reapers.  Use them for scouting by poking at your opponents front in order to determine what your opponent can or cannot be doing as well as potentially killing a Marine or SCV.  Against Reaper play, keep your Reapers more defensively positioned.

Transitions

This build can transition into Marine/Tank or Mech very easily. However you cannot transition into Bio/Hellbat because you have not invested any time into getting the early game Bio upgrades.

When transitioning into Marine/Tank, start your tank production soon, using the Widow Mines and Reapers to stay safe as well as apply pressure. As your Medivac is moving out, swap your Barracks onto the Factorys Reactor and start double Marine production, add on a Tech lab onto your Factory to start Siege Tank production, and build two more Barracks and a third Refinery as soon as you can afford it to complete your 2 base infrastructure.

When transitioning into Mech, again you must rely on the Widow Mines and Reapers to stay safe and apply pressure, but this time back at home you must be playing greedily. You can dump your money into a 3rd base while your Medivac is moving out. Once youve started 3 bases, getting 2 more Factories, all your Refineries, and a decent Siege Tank count is your obvious next move. YoDa likes to also make a Tech lab on his Starport to get Ravens, but this is a stylistic choice that you dont have to make.

Pros and Cons

This build is great because it gives you a good economy and gives you lots of map control with the early game Reapers/Widow Mines. The harass you can apply is incredibly effective if you split up your Widow Mines effectively throughout your opponents base.

However, it is somewhat vulnerable to Banshee play, so be sure to position your Widow Mines defensively against Banshees. Also, with poor Medivac control, you can very easily lose your Medivac and all the Widow Mines if you fly directly into a Viking or Marine pack. Be sure to prioritize keeping the Medivac alive above all else.

Force the Zerg to make hydras and spores to counter the five phoenix you make and then counter this forced investment by teching quickly to colossus. The phoenixes then provide the scouting information that you need to react well to the multitude of strategies that Zerg can throw at you. On top of this advantage they are excellent at harassment (killing drones and queens) and at denying map vision.

Hard counters:Greedy Zerg play is the best thing against this build. The phoenix force Zerg into hydras however they do not guarantee the fact that Zerg doesnt take a 4th base and drone as hard as possible. Still this does not mean that the game is over, with good scouting of Zergs eggs you can take your own 3rd earlier than 10:20 and develop your own economy alongside Zergs. In addition to this weakness early swarm host play off 2 base can be extremely hard to deal with due to the investment into phoenix. A throughout probe scout at the start of the game to deduce if gas has been taken and Zergs third base timing will give you the information you need to go robo first or oracle instead of phoenix.

Reactions:Reaction should be made after seeing units pop out of the eggs.

Lings: Take a slightly earlier 3rd (9:30), skipping immortals and making several zealots to protect the probe and constructing nexus.

Roach: Start immortals before colossus. Either 2 immortals or 1 before the first colossus depending on how early Zerg starts producing roach. Here it is also important to not skip the observer because roach burrow may be a possibility.

Hydra: Skip immortals and continue colossus production.

Vipers: Add Templar archives as soon as possible; cut out void rays as soon as the hive is scouted. For this to work well you may need to warp in zealots for the time being instead of stalkers so you can immediately have gas for 3-5 high Templars when the archives finishes.
